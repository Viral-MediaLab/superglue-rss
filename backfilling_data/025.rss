      <description>&gt;&gt; SLOW ON 93 SOUTH FROM MEDFORD
INTO SOMERVILLE.
AS WE SHIFT SOUTHBOUND AND SLOW GOING RARELY DO WE GET RELIEF
FROM THE BRAINTREE SPLIT UP TO
COLUMBIA ROAD AND THINGS SLIGHTLY BACKED UP ON LEVERETT
CONNECTOR.
HERE ARE LIVE DRIVE TIMES, 33 MINUTES ON PIKE EASTBOUND FROM
495 TO MASS AVE.
&gt;&gt; Gene: DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON ARE NECK AND
NECK IN THE GRANITE STATE.
&gt;&gt; Sara: FOX25 LIVE IN ATKINSON IS MICHAEL HENRICH AND
DONALD TRUMP HOLDING A RALLY.
&gt;&gt; Michael: ONE OF TWO STOPS OVER NEXT SEVERAL DAYS IN
NEW HAMPSHIRE.
HILLARY CLINTON WILL ALSO COME TO NEW HAMPSHIRE ON SUNDAY BUT
EITHER ONE WHICHEVER ONE IS
ELECTED PRESIDENT, THEY WILL NEED TO WORK WITH CONGRESS AND,
THEREFORE, THEY HAVE A LOT OF
INTEREST AND WHO WINS THE SENATE RACE.
LET'S GO TO THE POLLS FOR U.S.
SENATE IN THE GRANITE STATE. FIRST LET'S GO TO THE UMASS
LOWELL POLL WHICH WAS JUST RHETT
RHETT -- RELEASED YESTERDAY AFTERNOON AND TIE WITHIN THE
MARGIN OF ERROR AND INCUMBENT
KELLY AYOTTE 47%. SUFFOLK UNIVERSITY POLL IT HAS
AYOTTE WITH A TWO-POINT LEAD,
44% SUPPORT TO HASSAN'S 42%. ONE SHOWS ONE CANDIDATE UP, ONE
SHOWS ANOTHER CANDIDATE UP, SO
CLEARLY THIS IS A VERY CLOSE RACE AND ALL EYES ON WHAT WILL
BE DECIDED BY GRANITE STATE
VOTERS ON TUESDAY. FOR NOW LIVE IN ATKINSON,
NEW HAMPSHIRE, MICHAEL HENRICH,
FOX25 NEWS. &gt;&gt; Sara: MELANIA TRUMP HIT
CAMPAIGN TRAIL LAYING OUT VISION
WHAT SHE WOULD DO AS FIRST LADY. TRUMP CLAIMS SHE HAD FOCUS ON
COMBATING ONLINE BULLYING AND
SERVE AS ADVOCATE FOR WOMEN AND CHILDREN.
FIRST PUBLIC SPEECH SINCE THE
CONVENTION. SHE SAID THE NATION AS WHOLE
NEEDS TO MAKE A CHANGE.
&gt;&gt; OUR CULTURE HAS GOTTEN TOO MEAN AND TOO ROUGH.
WE HAVE TO FIND BETTER WAY TO
TALK TO EACH OTHER TO ACCEPT EACH OTHER.
&gt;&gt; THIS MORNING SOME CRITICIZING
TRUMP BECAUSE WHILE SHE CALLED FOR END TO BULLYING SHE NEVER
ADDRESSED HER HUSBAND'S OWN
REMARKS TOWARD WOMEN.</description>

      <description>BOTH IN SPEECHES AND ON SOCIAL
MEDIA.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Sara: HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN GETTING DOSE OF STAR
POWER.
SEVERAL NEWS REPORTS SAYS BEYONCE TAKE STAGE IN CLEVELAND
TODAY AT GET OUT AND VOTE AND
JAY-Z ALREADY KNOWN AS PERFORMER.
CLINTON IS USING CONCERT AS
EFFORT TO REACH MORE YOUNGER VOTERS.
FOUR DAYS AWAY FROM ELECTION
DAY. TUESDAY STAY WITH FOX25
THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT AND
COMPLETE ON AIR AT 4:00. &gt;&gt; Gene: NEW REWARD FOR
INFORMATION ABOUT DISAPPEARANCE.
WE TOLD BUT NORMAN LEE YESTERDAY.
THE WEYMOUTH COMIC BOOK ARTIST
MANAGED WHILE SNORKELING A YEAR AND A HALF WHILE WITH HIS WIFE
IN GRAND CAYMAN ISLANDS.
POLICE THERE ASSUMED HE DROWNED. NEW $10,000 FBI REWARD NOW
GIVING HOPE TO LEE'S SISTER AND
BRIDGEWATER CHIEF OF POLICE, CHILDHOOD FRIENDS.
BOTH SAY THEY JUST WANT ANSWERS.
&gt;&gt; LOOKING FOR CLOSURE. &gt;&gt; DO YOU THINK HE IS THE VICTIM
OF FOUL PLAY?
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS THAT NEED
TO BE ANSWERED. &gt;&gt; FBI HASN'T SAID WHY IT CHOSE
TO OFFER THE REWARD NOW, ONLY
SAYING IT IS LOOKING FOR INFORMATION ABOUT HIS
DISAPPEARANCE OR WHEREABOUTS.
&gt;&gt; Sara: MAJOR CONSEQUENCES FOR THE HARVARD MEN'S SOCCER
TEAM.
THE SEASON HAS BEEN CANCELED AFTER SCOUTING REPORT THAT RATED
WOMEN OF THE WOMAN'S SOCCER
TEAM. THE SCHOOL'S PRESIDENT SAYS THEY
HAVE ZERO TOLERANCE FOR THIS
TYPE OF BEHAVIOR. &gt;&gt; THEY SAY THIS DECISION THEY
MADE CANCELED THE REST AND MADE
THE DECISION BECAUSE IN THEIR VIEW THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE.
&gt;&gt; NOT SURE WHO STARTED THE
WEBSITE AND WEBSITE BUT STILL EMBARRASSING.
&gt;&gt; A DECISION THAT HAS HARVARD
UNIVERSITY TALKING AND REST OF THE MEN'S SOCCER TEAM AMID
ALLEGATIONS.
&gt;&gt; COLLEGE REALLY TRIES TO EXEMPLIFY WITH WHAT IT DOES AND
MESSAGE TRIES TO RATE OVERALL
AND DEFINITELY UNFORTUNATE. &gt;&gt; Catherine: UNIVERSITY SAYS
IT HAS LEARNED THE MEN'S SOCCER
TEAM WAS CREATING SEXUALLY EXPLICIT REPORTS RATING FEMALE
PLAYERS BY LOOKS AND HARVARD
CRIMSON NEWSPAPER FIRST REPORTED LAST MONTH IT ALLEGEDLY STARTED
WITH THE 2012 MEN'S TEAM AND
FOX25 LEARNED IT HAS CONTINUED. &gt;&gt; NOT SOMETHING EVER BEEN DONE
AND GIVEN VALUES TO PROMOTE IT
IS KIND OF EMBARRASSING IN THAT REGARD.
&gt;&gt; Catherine: THIS IS VIDEO
FROM THE UNIVERSITY WEBSITE SHOWING TEAM PLAYING CORNELL
EARLIER THIS SEASON AND DECISION
TO CANCEL THE SEASON ISN'T WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE.
HAD THE TEAM WON THIS SATURDAY'S
GAME THEY WOULD BE HEADED TO NCAA TOURNAMENT AND HAD BEEN
FIRST IN LEAGUE.
IN STATEMENT HARVARD'S PRESIDENT SAYS I WAS DEEPLY DISTRESSED OF
THE SOCCER TEAM WAS NOT ISOLATED
TO ONE YEAR OR THE ACTIONS OF FEW INDIVIDUALS.
&gt;&gt; I'M SURE NOT EVERY PLAYER ON
THE TEAM PLAYED ROLE IN IT SO UNFAIR ALL OF THEM GET SAME
PUNISHMENT BUT THAT'S THE WAY IT
IS. NOTHING ELSE THAT COULD BE DONE.
&gt;&gt; Catherine: I HAVE BEEN
WORKING TO SPEAK WITH MORE STUDENTS THIS MORNING.
SOME HASN'T HEARD ABOUT THIS,
SOME TOLD ME THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY OPINIONS ON IT AND STUDENTS
SAID HEARD FROM THERE AND SAID
MOST IMPORTANT THING WHAT HARVARD IS GOING TO DO ABOUT
THIS MOVING FORWARD AND HARVARD
DID SAY IT PLANS TO EDUCATE STUDENT ATHLETES ABOUT TOPICS
LIKE THESE, SPECIFICALLY THE
TEAM. LIVE AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY,
CATHERINE PARROTTA, FOX25 NEWS.
&gt;&gt; Sara: IN YOU LAWSUIT ACCUSING OF NOT PROTECTING
STUDENTS.
21-YEAR-OLD FROM NEW JERSEY SAYS SHE WAS RAPED BY CLASSMATE AFTER
PARTY IN 2013.
SHE REPORTED WHAT HAPPENED TO CAMPUS POLICE BUT OTHER STUDENT
WAS NOT PROSECUTED AND ALSO NOT
EXPELLED FROM SCHOOL AND WAS ALLOWED TO KEEP LIVING IN THE
SAME DORM AS HER.
THE SCHOOL'S INVESTIGATION MADE HER FEEL VICTIMIZED AGAIN.
QUESTIONS ASKED COMPLETELY
INAPPROPRIATE AND THINK ABOUT IT, NOW CAN'T BELIEVE OTHER
PEOPLE HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS
AS WELL. &gt;&gt; Sara: LAWSUIT ALSO CLAIMS
NORTHEASTERN FAILS TO REPORT AND
REPORTING CRIMES AND IT DOES SAY STUDENTS SAFETY IS TOP PRIORITY.
SUFFOLK COUNTY PROSECUTORS WON'T
COMMENT ON ANY CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION RELATED TO THE
CASE.
&gt;&gt; Gene: 8:39 THIS MORNING. MOTHER OF UMASS AMHERST STUDENT
THAT DIED SUING THE SCHOOL AFTER
SHE SAYS THEY DID NOT TRY TO GET HER SON HELP FOR HIS ADDICTION.
SHE SAYS WHEN ERICSSON WAS FOUND
WITH THE DRUG POLICE ASKED HIM TO BE INFORMANT AND HELP TAKE
DOWN DEALERS ON CAMPUS.
IN 2013 HE WAS FOUND DEAD IN HIS DORM ROOM FOLLOWING AN OVERDOSE.
HIS MOTHER SAYS THE SCHOOL HAD
TOLD HER ABOUT HIS ADDICTION HIS DEATH COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED.
&gt;&gt; Sara: WE TOLD BUT CAPTAIN
SHANE MORGAN A FEW WEEKS AGO. NEARLY A YEAR AGO CAPTAIN MORGAN
HAD HEART ATTACK WHILE DOING
PUSH-UPS AT FORT DEFFANS. INITIALLY THEY RULED THE HEART
ATTACK WAS NOT IN THE LINE OF
DUTY AND REFUSED TO PAY ANY OF THE MEDICAL BILLS.
NOW HAPPY TO REPORT THE DECISION
HAS BEEN REVERSED. &gt;&gt; FELT LIKE LAST YEAR WE HAVE
BEEN LIVING UNDER THE CLOUD AND
ALL OF A SUDDEN WE ARE FREE. &gt;&gt; Sara: CAPTAIN MORGAN SAYS
THEY HAVE TOTALED MORE THAN
$100,000 AND ARMY WILL PAY ALL OF IT INCLUDING OUT-OF-POCKET
EXPENSES NOT COVERED BY THE
PRIVATE INSURANCE. &gt;&gt; Gene: GIRL DROPS ALL OF
CUPCAKES BEFORE SHE CAN GET TO
CLASSMATES. HOW THE BUS DRIVER SAVED THE DAY
IN BETWEEN BUS ROUTES.
&gt;&gt; Daniel: GOOD MORNING, I'M FOX25 DANIEL MILLER.
THERE'S A DISGUSTING PROBLEM
PLAGUING ONE LOCAL TOWN. COMING UP NEXT AFTER THE BREAK
WHY OFFICIAL SAY THERE'S NO
SOLUTION TO THIS BROWN TAP WATER &gt;&gt; Shiri: SUN WILL COME UP AT
6:24 AND SUN GOES DOWN 4:30 IN
THE AFTERNOON GOT WEEKEND FORECAST COMING UP BUT FIRST IN
THIS WEEK'S FIREHOUSE FRIDAY
VISIT MEDWAY FIRE DEPARTMENT AND GET TOUR OF THE FACILITY AND
HELPS FIREFIGHTERS WITH
CHALLENGING CONDITIONS. &gt;&gt; Michelle: MEDWAY FIRE
DEPARTMENT SHARES WITH US THE
CONSTANT REMINDER TO STAY SAFE AND GET THE JOB DONE.
&gt;&gt; KEEP FIREFIGHTERS SAFE.
SINCE I HAVE TAKEN CHARGE OF THE DEPARTMENT ANY NEW APPARATUS WE
HAVE HAS IT ON SITES TO BE SAFE.
WE ARE TRAINING CONSTANTLY SO WE ARE PREPARED IN THE EVENT WE ARE
NEEDED.
&gt;&gt; Michelle: TRAINING HAPPENED ALMOST EVERYDAY AND UNFORTUNATE
TO HAVE A BURN TRAILER RIGHT
ON-SITE. &gt;&gt; A LOT OF LIVE BURN TRAINING
IN HERE AND TWO OR THREE TIME A
MONTH AND PRETTY -- DO PRETTY EXTENSIVE TRAINING IN HERE.
IT IS A GREAT RESOURCE THAT'S
FOR SURE. &gt;&gt; WE ARE ABLE TO SIMULATE FIRES
IN THE TRAILER SO THAT
FIREFIGHTERS CAN GET USED TO THE HEAT AND SMOKE CONDITIONS WERE
ABLE TO HAVE WALLS AND NOT SAME
SET-UP EVERY TIME AND WHEN YOU ENTER A FIRE LITERALLY CANNOT
SEE A HAND IN FRONT OF YOU.
SO WE ARE ABLE TO SIMULATE THAT IN THIS BURN TRAILER SO GIVES US
EXPERIENCE.
&gt;&gt; Michelle: EXPERIENCE IS GOOD THING BECAUSE NUMBER OF
CALLS IN MEDWAY HAS ONLY BEEN
GROWING. &gt;&gt; THIS YEAR ON TRACK FOR 15%
INCREASE.

      <description>&gt;&gt; Daniel: MANDATING THE TOWN
PLUSHES TWICE A YEAR FOR SAFETY
BUT THESE DAYS IT IS HAPPENING MORE LIKE ONCE A WEEK.
&gt;&gt; PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN
ALREADY BUILT AND IN OPERATION HAVING NOT HAD THE ARCHEOLOGICAL
AND TREATMENT PLANT TO FILTER
OUT THE METALS AND SITE PLAN FOR THE FACILITY MAY HAVE
CONNECTIONS TO THE COMP NAG
INDIAN TRIBE BUT WAITING GAME. &gt;&gt; GOING TO STRIP APPROXIMATELY
18 INCHES OF SOIL AND WHAT WE
ARE LOOKING FOR ANY TYPE OF SIGNIFICANT ARTIFACTS.
&gt;&gt; WORST I HAVE EVER SEEN THE
WATER. IT IS MUD, MUD.
&gt;&gt; HAS TO PASS INSPECTION
SCHEDULED FOR NEXT TUESDAY AND PASSING THEN GROUNDBREAKING
HAPPEN NEXT YEAR AND COULD BE
ANOTHER 18 MONTHS BEFORE IT IS IN OPERATION.
NEWSROOM, I'M DANIEL MILLER,
FOX25 NEWS. &gt;&gt; Julie: 24, 95 ARE CLEAR,
SURPRISING 95 USUALLY SLOWS DOWN
EVEN AT THIS TIME OF THE MORNING IN THAT ELBOW FROM CANTON UP TO
128 BUT RIGHT NOW MOVING ALONG
FINE. A LITTLE BIT SLOW ON EXPRESSWAY
FROM THE BRAINTREE SPLIT AROUND
MORRISSEY BOULEVARD AND NEPONSET AREA.
THINGS NICE AND BRIGHT AND GRAB
SUNGLASSES AND GET OUT THE DOOR. 12 MINUTES ROUTE 3 FROM 228 TO
THE SPLIT.
12 MINUTES ON 24, 22 MINUTES ON THE EXPRESSWAY FROM THE
BRAINTREE SPLIT TO COLUMBIA
ROAD. METEOROLOGIST SHIRI SPEAR
JOINING US NOW AND I LIKE THE
SUNSHINE I'M SEEING IN MY TRAFFIC CAMERAS, SHIRI.
THEY ARE COMING WITH REASONABLE
APPROPRIATE TEMPERATURE. &gt;&gt; REASONABLE APPROPRIATE
TEMPERATURES THAT KIND OF FEELS,
LOOKS LIKE NOVEMBER. IN FACT, GOT PHOTO IN ON TWITTER
THIS MORNING AND THIS COMES FROM
BOB AND SEE WEST BOYLSTON LOOKING VERY PRETTY AND REALLY
NICE POPS OF COLOR RIGHT NOW OUT
IN THIS NECK OF THE WOODS GETTING REPORTED OF A LOT OF
COLOR -- REPORTS OF A LOT OF
COLOR, PASS PEAK, BEST COLOR RIGHT NOW ACROSS EASTERN AND
SOUTHEASTERN MASSACHUSETTS AND
DOWN ACROSS THE SOUTHCOAST OF MASSACHUSETTS.
A LOT OF THAT COLOR EITHER FADED
OR GONE INTO CENTRAL AND NORTHERN NEW ENGLAND.
EVEN JUST PASSING OVER THE
BORDER INTO NEW HAMPSHIRE. SO WEATHER PATTERN TODAY DOES
INVOLVE A WEAK FRONT COMING
THROUGH AS IT DOES IT IS STIRRING UP CLOUDS SO WE GOT
PARTLY SUNNY SKIES THIS MORNING,
BOSTON HAS LOOKED PICTURE PERFECT THIS MORNING SO FAR.
GOING TO BE BRIGHT AND BREEZY
AND TEMPERATURES THAT ARE WHERE THEY SHOULD BE THIS TIME OF THE
YEAR BUT THEY ARE GOING TO BE
ABOUT TENÂ° COOLER THAN WHAT SAW YESTERDAY.
54 IN BOSTON ROCKPORT UP TO
PORTSMOUTH, NEW HAMPSHIRE, 52 IN NASHUA AND 48Â° IN KEENE, 50 ON
THE NOSE HERE IN WORCESTER, BUT
WE GOT ALL MID-50s BACK TO FRAMINGHAM, DOWN TO FOXBOROUGH,
HOW ABOUT 58 IN BRIDGEWATER OR
92 UN. MID-50s FOR THE SOUTH SHORE AS
WELL AS CAPE THIS AFTERNOON AND
I THINK WE COULD END UP WITH A LITTLE MORE CLOUD COVER OCEAN
EFFECT CLOUDS AND JUMPING AHEAD
NOW TO TOMORROW MORNING WE START OUT WITH SOME INCREASING CLOUDS,
SLIGHT RISK THAT YOU'RE GOING TO
CATCH QUICK FLURRY OR QUICK LITTLE SPRINKLE TOMORROW.
I HAVE TO SAY MENTIONING IT
BECAUSE IT IS A SLIGHT POSSIBILITY BUT OVERALL IT LOOKS
LIKE THE EXCEPTION NOT THE RULE.
THE RULE TOMORROW LOOKS PARTLY CLOUDY AND DRY AS WE EASE INTO
YOUR SUNDAY HERE AND FUTURE CAST
CARRIES CLOUDS INTO THE COAST AND EASTERN MASS THERE'S THE
SLIGHT RISK THAT WE ARE GOING TO
CATCH A RAIN DROP OR TWO IN THOSE CLOUDS.
OTHERWISE GOING TO KEEP PARTLY
SUNNY MOSTLY DRY, A LITTLE BIT BRIGHTER INLAND TOWNS AND
CITIES, WEEKEND HIGHS ARE GOING
TO BE BACK INTO THE LOWER 50s IN BOSTON AND HYANNIS TOMORROW
OVER TO HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT
AND PUP IN CONCORD, NEW HAMPSHIRE, BUT IT IS 40s
BOTH DAYS IN WORCESTER AND EVEN
BOSTON BY SUNDAY AT ONLY 49Â°. HERE IS 7-DAY FORECAST WITH THE
WEEKEND ALWAYS IN VIEW, KEEP IN
MIND WE HAVE ALSO GOT VERY COLD MORNINGS OVER THE WEEKEND WITH
20s AND 30s IN PARTICULAR
TOMORROW MORNING AND MOST OF YOU ARE GOING TO SEE FREEZING
TEMPERATURES.
GETTING INTO NEXT WEEK LOOKING NICE AND BRIGHT MONDAY TUESDAY
WITH HIGHS BACK IN THE 50s, A
LITTLE GRADUAL WARM-UP TOWARD THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK WITH SOME
WEDNESDAY RAIN EXPECTED.
BACK TO YOU GUYS. &gt;&gt; Sara: DIEHARD MAKES A
DECISION THAT LASTS A LIFETIME.
COMING UP WHY INDIAN DECIDED -- FAN DECIDED TO GET INK BEFORE</description>

COMPLETELY BLIND SIDED ABOUT REEBOK BIG MOVE TO BOSTON AND
TOLD YOU YESTERDAY IT PLANS ON

TELL FOX25 THEY LEARNED OF THE
PLAN FROM A SECURITY GUARD. REEBOK HAS BEEN IN CANTON 16
YEARS AND JOINING CONVERSE AND
NEW BALANCE AND EYEING BOSTON FOR LOCATION FOR THE NEW HOME.
MAYOR MARTY WALSH CALLS LATEST
EDITION A BIG WIN FOR THE CITY. &gt;&gt; EXCITED ABOUT REEBOK COMING
IN.
I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH THEM A FEW DAYS AGO AND THEY WERE
REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE
POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITY COMING TO THE CITY OF BOSTON.
&gt;&gt; Gene: THERE ARE 950
EMPLOYEES AT CANTON HEADQUARTERS.
REEBOK SAYS 650 OF THOSE
EMPLOYEES ARE MOVING TO THE NEW LOCATION.
REST WILL TRANSFER OUT OF STATE
OR BE LAID OFF. INSIDERS SAY MILLENNIALS ARE
HEART OF THE MOVE AND SNEAKER
COMPANY WANTS TO BE PART OF MORE VIBRANT COMMUNITY.
&gt;&gt; Sara: RIGHT NOW LOOKING AT
LIVE SHOT FROM CHICAGO WHERE THEY ARE ACTUALLY DYING THE
RIVER BLUE TODAY AHEAD OF THE
CHAMPIONSHIP PARADE. AND THIS LOOKS JUST AMAZING.
A VERY COOL THING.
THAT PARADE WILL START AT WRIGLEY FIELD IN JUST ABOUT 1
HOUR.
WE NOW KNOW THAT GAME SEVEN SCORED AND BASEBALL GAME FOR 25
YEARS AND LAST TIME THEY WERE ON
GAME WAS 1991. 50 MILLION PEOPLE WATCHED THE
MINNESOTA TWINS BEAT THE ATLANTA
BRAVES. &gt;&gt; Gene: SCENE IN CHICAGO

HISTORY. BALL FROM FINAL OUT FROM THE
WORLD SERIES CLINCHER.
EXPERTS SAY IT COULD BE WORTH $3 MILLION.
HERE IT IS AGAIN.
MOMENT FIRST BASEMAN ANTHONY RIZZO FINAL OUT OF THE CUBS
CHAMPIONSHIP.
EDDIE-- REACHED RIGHT IN HIS POT FOR SAFEKEEPING.
2004 WORLD SERIES WHERE RED SOX
BROKE THE CURSE. FINAL OUT AND HE KEPT IT.
DID SPARK CONTROVERSY WHEN JOKED
IT WOULD BE RETIREMENT FUND AND PEOPLE WERE SO ANGRY EVEN GOT
DEATH THREATS.
NEVER HAD ANY INTENTION OF SELLING THE BALL AND RED SOX AND
AGREED TO DONATE IT TO THE
BASEBALL HALL OF FAME. &gt;&gt; Sara: INDIANS FAN MAY HAVE
AWKWARD CONVERSATIONS BECAUSE OF
NEW TATTOO. HE TWEETED OUT PICTURE BEFORE
THE GAME SEVEN OF THE WORLD
SERIES. CAPTION SOME CALL IT BOLD BUT I
CALL IT FAITH IN CLUBBER.
BOLD GAMBLE THAT DIDN'T PAY OFF WE ALL KNOW HOW THE GAME TURNED
OUT.
HE SEEMS TO BE DOING OKAY. HE CONDEMNED INDIANS AND SAYS
THEY OWE HIM A BIG VICTORY NEXT
YEAR. &gt;&gt; Gene: BIG PATCH WILL COVER
IT UP.
HE WILL FIND A SOLUTION, I'M SURE.

DOING ON THE HIGHWAY AROUND
10:30 BUT WE KNOW VERY TOUGH SCENE HERE AFTER THE FACT THIS
HAPPENED AND PERSON HIT BY ONE
CAR AND THEN HIT BY SEVERAL OTHERS THAT WERE PASSING BY.
WE HAVE VIDEO FROM THE SCENE AND
WANT TO SHOW YOU NOW AND YOU CAN SEE ONE OF THE CARS LOOKS TO BE
INVOLVED IN THE ACCIDENT WITH

QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY LED UP TO THIS AND POLICE LOOKING TO
IDENTIFY THE VICTIMS, STILL
WORKING TO NOTIFY THE FAMILY MEMBERS BUT BIGGEST QUESTION IS

WILL BE IN THE STATE REPEATEDLY AND SEE BEHIND ME THE BIG TRUMP
BUS OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY CLUB IN
ATKINSON, NEW HAMPSHIRE                        .
IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THIS
POLL WAS TAKEN ENTIRELY AFTER FBI DIRECTOR COMEY'S LETTER TO
CONGRESS ABOUT THE CLINTON
E-MAIL INVESTIGATION AND THAT'S THE POINT WHEN CLINTON SAW HER
LEAD DISAPPEAR, SUPPORT DROPPED
IN THE SUFFOLK UNIVERSITY POLLING BY TWO POINTS AND DID
STAY THE SAME AND END RESULT IS
THE STATISTICAL TIE. BOTH CANDIDATES CAMPAIGNED AND
HERE IS WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY.
&gt;&gt; WE KNOW HILLARY CAN'T BE TRUSTED.
WE SAID THAT WITH AMERICA'S
SECURITY. TAKE LOOK AT E-MAIL SITUATION
CAN WE TRUST HER WITH OUR
SECURITY? &gt;&gt; IT IS ABOUT WHO WE ARE AND WE
WANT AND MAKE OUR MARK ON OUR
COUNTRY AT THIS TIME IN OUR HISTORY.
&gt;&gt; Michael: TRUMP HERE TODAY
IN ATKINSON IN NOON AND AT MANCHESTER ON MONDAY AND SUNDAY
HILLARY CLINTON WILL BE IN
MANCHESTER. TOMORROW CHELSEA CLINTON WILL BE
IN THE STATE AND MONDAY
PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL MAKE ONE FINAL PUSH FOR FORMER SECRETARY
OF STATE AT U.N.H.
AGAIN, THAT'S HAPPENING ON MONDAY, ONE DAY BEFORE ELECTION
DAY.
LIVE IN ATKINSON, NEW HAMPSHIRE, I'M MICHAEL HENRICH, FOX25 NEWS.
&gt;&gt; Gene: IF YOU ARE PLANNING
ON VOTING EARLY MAKE SURE YOU CHECK WHAT TIME THE POLLS CLOSE
IN YOUR TOWN.
TOWNS WERE ALLOWED TO SET THEIR OWN HOURS AND MANY OF THEM HAVE
HALF DAYS ON FRIDAY.
SECRETARY OF STATE BILL GALVIN SAYS THAT HE ASKED SOME TOWNS TO
EXTENT HOURS AND SOME HAVE.
SO FAR MORE THAN 800,000 PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF EARLY
VOTING AND OFFICIALS THINK THAT
NUMBER COULD SURPASS MILLION.</description>

&gt;&gt; Sara: FATHER OF THIRD GRADER BROUGHT SON TO SCHOOL NOW
FACING CHARGE AND GUN DID NOT
BELONG TO HIM. EIGHT-YEAR-OLD BROUGHT THE
25 CALIBER PISTOL TO THE
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN LOWELL AND PULLED IT OUT OF BACKPACK AFTER
SCHOOL AND SHOWED IT TO SEVERAL
CLASSMATES. THE BOY CLAIMS HE THOUGHT IT WAS
A TOY.
HE TOLD POLICE HE FOUND THE GUN IN A BOX THAT BELONGED TO
RELATIVE.
THE RELATIVE'S HOME HAD BURNED IN A FIRE AND THE BOY'S FAMILY

BELONGINGS. PARENTS AT THE BOY'S SCHOOL WERE

&gt;&gt; PRE-K TO FOURTH GRADE, WHAT ARE THEY DOING WITH GUNS?
&gt;&gt; Sara: WE REACHED OUT ABOUT
THE INCIDENT BUT NOT HEARD BACK. &gt;&gt; Gene: ROOKIE POLICE OFFICER
ACCUSED OF TEXTING BEHIND THE
WHEEL BEFORE A CRASH. HE IS ON PAID LEAVE THIS

HE WAS OFF-DUTY. HE ENDED UP STOPPING DOWN THE
ROAD WHEN HE CALLED POLICE AND
TOLD OFFICER WHAT HAD HAPPENED. HIS SISTER OFFERS AN

&gt;&gt; Gene: HE WILL HAVE TO APPEAR IN FRONT OF A JUDGE.
&gt;&gt; Sara: SENTENCING RETRIAL
FOR MAN CONVICTED OF KILLING THREE PEOPLE IN 2001 CONTINUES
TODAY.
THE CONFESSION OF CONVICTED KILLER GARY LEE SAMPSON WAS
PLAYED IN COURT YESTERDAY.
SOUTHERN NEW HAMPSHIRE IS BACK IN COURT FIVE YEARS AFTER THE
DEATH SENTENCE THROWN OUT DUE TO
A TECHNICALITY. HIS ATTORNEYS ARE TRYING TO
CONNECT HIS KILLING SPREE TO
BRAIN INJURY THAT HE SUFFERED WHEN FELL DOWN THE STAIRS AT
FOUR YEARS OLD.
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS HIS POLICE SHOWS HOW CALCULATED HE WAS.
&gt;&gt; I STABBED HIM IN THE HEART
AND LUNG AND CHEST AND THE THROAT AND WENT DOWN TO THE
GROUND AND SLIT THROAT.
WHY? I DO NOT KNOW.
&gt;&gt; Sara: SAMPSON WAS CONVICTED
IN 2003 OF KILLING THREE MEN. ONCE TESTIMONY IS OVER THE JURY
WILL ONCE AGAIN DECIDE WHETHER
TO SENTENCE SAMPSON TO DEATH. &gt;&gt; Gene: MBTA FIGHTING BACK
AGAINST SEXUAL ASSAULT IN EFFORT
TO KEEP RIDERS SAFE. THE "T" TEAMED UP WITH THE
BOSTON AREA RAPE CRISIS CENTER
AND OTHER GROUPS. AS PART OF THE CAMPAIGN HUNDREDS
OF SIGNS HAVE BEEN POSTED AND
POST CARDS WILL BE HANDED OUT TO HELP RAISE AWARENESS.
THEIR GOAL IS TO IMPROVE
PASSENGER SAFETY AND ENCOURAGE VICTIMS AND RIDERS TO REPORT
INCIDENTS.
&gt;&gt; COMING FORWARD AND LOSING PRIVACY OF BEING BLAMED AND NOT
BEING BELIEVED.
&gt;&gt; Gene: CAMPAIGN LAUNCHED YESTERDAY AND RUN THROUGH
FEBRUARY.
MORE "T" RIDERS COMPLAINING ABOUT DIRTY STATIONS.
THE HERALD REPORTS DOZENS OF
JANITORS LAID OFF IN SEPTEMBER. SINCE THEN COMPLAINTS ABOUT
TRASH, BAD SMELLS, DIRTY FLOORS
AND OVERFLOWING TRASH CANS HAVE JUMPED BY NEARLY 50%.
THE JANITOR'S UNION SAYS THE
REMAINING WORKERS SIMPLY CAN'T KEEP UP WITH WORKLOAD.
THE "T" SAYS IT REGULARLY
INSPECTS THE STATION FOR CLEANLINESS AND COMPLAINTS
REPRESENT A SMALL FRACTION OF
DAILY RIDERS. &gt;&gt; Sara: MASS DOT CLOSE PART
OF THE HIGHWAY TO HEAR DOWN OLD
HIGHLAND AVENUE BRIDGE. THIS IS HAPPENING AT EXIT 19
STARTING TONIGHT IN 8:00 P.M.
NORTHBOUND SIDE WILL BE CLOSED AND BOTH SIDES WILL BE SHUT DOWN

      <description>&gt;&gt; Gene: FORMER PATRIOT PLAYER
REPORTED DYING FROM CTE, IN THE
ALS AS PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT. NEW RESEARCH AT BU THAT SOME ARE
CALLING A GAME CHANGER.
&gt;&gt; Daniel: FULLBACK THAT RAN PEOPLE OVER AND PLAYED WITH THE
PATRIOTS THREE SEASONS AND DIED
WHAT ORIGINALLY THOUGHT WAS ALS AND THEY DETERMINED THE DEATH
WAS NOT CAUSED BY ALS BUT RATHER
THE RESULT OF REPEATED HEAD TRAUMA FROM YEARS OF PLAYING
FOOTBALL.
&gt;&gt; QUESTION WAS THIS ALS OR CTE. &gt;&gt; Daniel: BOSTON UNIVERSITY
CTE CENTER AND VA BOSTON
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM CAME TO A DRAMATIC CONCLUSION.
&gt;&gt; CELLS THAT RUN WITH AXONS ALL
THE WAY DOWN TO THE SPINAL CORD THEY WERE DESTROYED BY CTE.
THIS IS WHAT THE BRAIN OF
60-YEAR-OLD SHOULD LOOK LIKE AND THIS IS KEVIN'S BRAIN AT 46.
&gt;&gt; Daniel: LEAD TO PALPABLE
MOTION AS THEY WERE DETAILED. &gt;&gt; THIS IS KEVIN'S PARENTS.
&gt;&gt; Daniel: PARENTS ARE DEAL
WITH THE PREMATURE LOSS OF THEIR SON, REFLECTING ON LIFE CHOICE
THAT DRAMATICALLY ALTERED
KEVIN'S FATE. &gt;&gt; I WAS A COACH AND YOU HIT
WITH YOUR HEAD.
THAT'S THE WAY YOU PLAYED FOOTBALL.
&gt;&gt; TURNER'S CASE START AT FIVE
YEARS OLD AND PLAY FOR 25 YEARS IT CAN DO -- DESTROY BRAIN.
&gt;&gt; I THINK NFL GOT TO GET OUT OF
THE GAME OF PROMOTING AND MARKETING FIVE-YEAR-OLDS TO THE
GAME.
THERE'S NO SAFE WAY TO HIT A CHILD IN THE HEAD 500 TIMES A
YEAR WHILE THE BRAIN IS STILL
DEVELOPING. &gt;&gt; Daniel: CLEAREST INDICATION
CTE CAN CAUSE THE SAME MOTOR
NEURON DISEASE THAT SHOWS UP IN ALS PATIENTS.
KEVIN TURNER WAS THE LEAD
PLAINTIFF IN CONCUSSION LAWSUIT AGAINST THE NFL.
IN THE NEWSROOM, I'M DANIEL
MILLER, FOX25 NEWS. &gt;&gt; Sara: NEWLY DISCOVERED
VIRAL MUTATION WHY SO MANY
PEOPLE WERE INFECTED WITH EBOLA AND AFRICA AND MUTATION SITS AT
THE TOP OF THE VIRUS MAKING IT
EASIER FOR THE DISEASE TO ENTER HUMAN CELLS.
THEY WERE LOOKING AT PROTEIN
FOUND IN HIV WHEN THEY DISCOVERED A SIMILAR TYPE OF
PROTEIN IN THE MOST DOMINANT
FORM OF THE EBOLA VIRUS.</description>

LIVE LOOK AT THE ZAKIM BRIDGE WERE THINGS BRIGHT IN ZAKIM AND
LEVERETT CONNECTOR.
HERE ARE LIVE DRIVE TIMES, 33 MINUTES ON PIKE EASTBOUND FROM
495 TO MASS AVE.
HALF HOUR ON THE EXPRESSWAY. 37 MINUTES ON 128 SOUTHBOUND
FROM PEABODY TO THE WESTON
TOLLS. METEOROLOGIST SHIRI SPEAR
JOINING US.
SHIRI, I CAN SEE A TON OF SUNSHINE IN OUR TRAFFIC AREA
THIS MORNING.
&gt;&gt; Sara: &gt;&gt; Shiri: HOW EXCITED WE ARE
THANKS AT 6:30 AND FEEL LIKE
SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN SO WARM SO MILD.
TODAY IS DAY IT STARTS COOLING
DOWN. GUSTS 20 TO 30 MILES PER HOUR
AND, OF COURSE, WE TURN THOSE
CLOCKS BACK HERE AND AGAIN EXTRA HOUR OF SLEEP HERE ON SUNDAY
MORNING.
SO 47 IN BOSTON, 37 RIGHT NOW IN PORTSMOUTH, NEW HAMPSHIRE.
A VARIETY OF TEMPERATURES ON THE
MAP RIGHT NOW WARM LOCATION WOULD BE THE CAPE AND 50s.
GO IN THE MIDDLE HERE NORWOOD AT
45. WE DON'T HAVE TOO MUCH WIND YET
NOW THAT THE SUN IS UP WHAT YOU
WILL FIND THE WINDS DO INCREASE THROUGH ABOUT LATE-MORNING,
CONTINUING INTO THE AFTERNOON
AND KEEPING THINGS PARTLY CLOUDY FOR SOME OF YOU ESPECIALLY
INLAND HERE EARLY THIS MORNING,
BUT OVERALL WE ARE LOOKING AT BRIGHT AND BREEZY DAY,
TEMPERATURES GET INTO THE MIDDLE
50s HERE, LOOK AT EVENING TEMPERATURES IF YOU'RE OUT ON
THE TOWN FRIDAY NIGHT,
6:00 P.M., WE ARE BACK AT ABOUT 49Â° AND SINK BACK INTO THE LOWER
AND MID-40s BY 8:00 THIS
EVENING AND IT IS GOING TO GET CHILLY OUT THERE IF YOU HAVE
OUTDOOR PLANS.
TEMPERATURES FOR HIGHS TODAY THOUGH INTO THE UPPER 50s WE
GO AND NORWOOD AND NEW BEDFORD
TODAY WE GOT MID-50s IN BOSTON, LAWRENCE OVER TO
FRAMINGHAM, ONLY ABOUT 50 IN
WORCESTER TODAY AND LOOK AT KEENE'S HIGH 48Â°, KIND OF CHILLY
AND WEEKEND GETS COOLER BECAUSE
WE HAVE LOWER 50s ON IT TOP TOMORROW AND THEN DROP IT ALL
THE WAY DOWN TO 49Â° HERE IN THE
BOSTON AREA ON SUNDAY. SO LET'S TIME IT OUT FUTURE CAST
AND CLEAR OUT REMAINING CLOUDS,
TURNS MOSTLY SUNNY THIS AFTERNOON AND A LITTLE BIT
BREEZY KEEPING AN EYE ON THE
CAPE HERE FOR OCEAN EFFECT CLOUD COVER AS WE GET INTO THE
SATURDAY I AM GOING WITH THE
SLIGHT RISK OF FLURRY OR SOME DRIZZLE AND ANYTHING WILL BE THE
EXCEPTION, NOT THE RULE AND RULE
MOSTLY DRY CONDITIONS AND ON AND OFF CLOUDS THROUGH MOST OF THE
WEEKEND.
NOW, INTO YOUR SUNDAY WHAT I SEE POTENTIAL FOR CLOUDS COMING IN
OFF THE OCEAN IF THAT HAPPENS WE
WILL DEAL WITH CLOUDIER CONDITIONS ALONG THE COASTLINE
AND SLIGHT RISK FOR SPRINKLE
THERE. OTHERWISE FURTHER INLAND YOU GO
THE BRIGHTER IT WILL BE.
7-DAY FORECAST FOR THE WEEKEND ALWAYS IN VIEW.
TEMPERATURES IN THE 50s FOR
THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS. REALLY COLD MORNINGS OVER THE
WEEKEND IN 20s AND 30s
WAKING UP TO 31 ON MONDAY WITH HIGH OF 54.

      <description>PICTURES FROM SKY FOX OVER 93
NORTHBOUND RIGHT BEFORE
ROUTE 62. WE HAVE A FUEL SPILL FROM
EARLIER TRUCK CRASH BUT CHECK
OUT THE VOLUME. IT IS JUST JAMPACKED RIGHT NOW.
THOSE ARE ALL BRAKE LIGHTS FOR
DRIVERS HEADING NORTH ON 93. AS WE TAKE YOU OUT TO THE MAP, I
WANT TO ZOOM IN A LITTLE BIT
CLOSER. YOU COULD SEE THOSE DELAYS ON 93
NORTH STRETCHING BACK TO 129.
SOUTHBOUND COMMUTERS SEEING DELAYS PAST ROUTE 62.
HOWEVER, I'M NOT SEEING PEOPLE
USING ANY OF THE SIDE ROADS YET TO HOP OFF AND GET BACK ON TO
AVOID THAT ACCIDENT SITE -- THE
FUEL SPILL RATHER THAT THEY ARE STILL WORKING TO CLEAN UP.
AS WE SHIFT SLIGHTLY SOUTH
THINGS SLOWING 128 WOBURN AND 93 SOUTH THROUGH MEDFORD.
LIVE DRIVE TIMES, 24 MINUTES
ROUTE 1, 25 MINUTES ON THE EXPRESSWAY AS YOU APPROACH THE
EXIT FOR THE PIKE.
STILL HALF HOUR ON 93 SOUTH, THAT'S IN THE SEGMENT NORTHBOUND
FROM THE LEVERETT CONNECTOR UP
TO 495. BACK TO YOU.
&gt;&gt; Gene: THIS MORNING POLICE
ARE PEACING TOGETHER A DEADLY ACCIDENT THAT SHUT DOWN ALL
THREE LANES OF 128 IN WALTHAM &gt;&gt; Sara: FINAL WEEKEND BEFORE
THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION JUST
LIKE THE PRIMARIES NEW HAMPSHIRE IS BATTLE GROUND.
NEW POLLS SHOW A VERY TIGHT
RACE. FOX25 MICHAEL HENRICH LIVE IN
ATKINSON WHERE DONALD TRUMP WILL
HOLD A RALLY TODAY BEFORE THE CLINTON CALVARY ARRIVES THIS
WEEKEND, MICHAEL.
&gt;&gt; Michael: YES, INDEED. GOING TO BE A VERY BUSY WEEKEND
FOR NEW HAMPSHIRE.
SOMETHING THAT THE GRANITE STATE IS PRETTY USED TO BUT THE
GENERAL ELECTION A FEW DAYS AWAY
AND CANDIDATES BOTH MAKING WAY HERE.
DONALD TRUMP WILL MAKE THE WAY
HERE MULTIPLE TIMES BEFORE ALL IS SAID AND DONE.
BUT LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHY
THIS LATEST POLL JUST OUT YESTERDAY AFTERNOON FROM SUFFOLK
UNIVERSITY SHOWING THAT THE
DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON ARE NOW OFFICIALLY TIED HERE IN
NEW HAMPSHIRE.
42% EACH IN THIS FOUR-WAY RACE. NOW, THIS POLL WAS TAKEN
ENTIRELY AFTER FBI DIRECTOR
LETTER TO CONGRESS LAST WEEK ABOUT THE CLINTON E-MAIL
INVESTIGATION.
THAT'S JUST ABOUT WHEN CLINTON SAW HER LEAD DISAPPEAR.
HER SUPPORT IN THIS POLL DROPS
TWO POINTS SINCE THE LAST ONE BY SUFFOLK UNIVERSITY.
IT MUST BE NOTED TRUMP'S NUMBERS
DIDN'T ACTUALLY RIGHT TO CREATE THIS TIE.
BOTH CANDIDATES IN THE CAROLINAS
YESTERDAY. LET'S HEAR FROM THEM.
&gt;&gt; WE KNOW HILLARY CAN'T BE
TRUSTED. WE LEARNED THAT.
WITH AMERICA'S SECURITY, TAKE
LOOK AT E-MAIL SITUATION. CAN WE TRUST HER WITH OUR
SECURITY?
&gt;&gt; IT IS ABOUT WHO WE ARE, WHAT WE WANT, WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO
TO MAKE OUR MARK ON OUR COUNTRY
AT THIS TIME IN OUR HISTORY. &gt;&gt; SO ONCE AGAIN THE RACE TO 270
WILL LIKELY INCLUDE
NEW HAMPSHIRE'S FOUR ELECTRIC TERMINAL --
ELECTORAL VOTES.
DONALD TRUMP RALLY WILL START IN NOON.
WE WILL BE BACK IN MANCHESTER ON
MONDAY, HILLARY CLINTON WILL CAMPAIGN IN MANCHESTER ON
SUNDAY, SENDING HER DAUGHTER
CHELSEA TO THE STATE TOMORROW AND VERY BUSY WEEKEND FOR
GRANITE STATERS AHEAD.
MICHAEL HENRICH, FOX25 NEWS. &gt;&gt; Sara: THIS IS THE FINAL DAY
FOR EARLY VOTING IN
MASSACHUSETTS AND STATE OFFICIALS SAY IF YOU'RE PLANNING
ON VOTING TODAY, MAKE SURE TO
CHECK WHAT TIME THE POLLS CLOSE IN YOUR TOWN.
TOWNS WERE ALLOWED TO SET THEIR
OWN HOURS AND MANY HAVE HOT DAYS ON FRIDAY.
SECRETARY OF STATE BILL GALVIN
SAYS SHE ASK SOME TOWNS TO EXTEND THE HOURS AND SOME HAVE
SO FAR MORE THAN 800,000 PEOPLE
HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF EARLY VOTING AND OFFICIALS THINK THAT
NUMBER COULD SURPASS A MILLION.
WE ARE FOUR DAYS AWAY FROM ELECTION DAY.
THIS TUESDAY STAY WITH FOX 25
THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT. WE WILL HAVE COMPLETE COVERAGE
ONLINE AND ON AIR BEGINNING AT
4:00 P.M. &gt;&gt; Gene: 7:07 THIS MORNING.
FATHER OF THIRD GRADER FACING
CHARGES BUT THE GUN DID NOT BELONG TO HIM.
THE EIGHT-YEAR-OLD BROUGHT THE
PISTOL TO LOWELL, PULLED IT OUT OF BACKPACK AFTER SCHOOL AND
SHOWED SEVERAL CLASSMATES.
THE BOY CLAIMS HE THOUGHT IT WAS A TOY.
HE TOLD POLICE HE FOUND THE GUN
IN A BOX THAT BELONGED TO A RELATIVE -P THE RELATIVE'S HOME
HAD BURNED IN A FIRE.
AND THE BOY'S FAMILY WAS HOLDING ON TO SOME OF THEIR BELONGINGS.
PARENTS AT THE BOY'S SCHOOL WERE
UPSET ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. &gt;&gt; WHEN I HEARD IT WAS A GUN, MY
HEART WENT DOWN TO THE GROUND.
ALL I COULD PICTURE WAS SCHOOL BEING SHOT UP AND MY GRAND
BABIES ARE THERE AND THEY ARE MY
LIFE. &gt;&gt; Gene: WE REACHED OUT TO THE
SCHOOL BUT WE HAVE NOT HEARD
BACK. &gt;&gt; Sara: 2001 SPREE KILLER
TRYING TO CONVINCE A JURY HE
SHOULDN'T DIE FOR WHAT HE DID. CONFESSION OF CONVICTED KILLER
GARY LEE SAMPSON WAS PLAYED IN
COURT YESTERDAY. SAMPSON IS BACK IN COURT FIVE
YEARS AFTER THE DEATH SENTENCE
WAS THROWN OUT ON A TECHNICALITY.
HIS ATTORNEYS ARE TRYING TO
CONNECT HIS KILLING SPREE TO A BRAIN INJURY THAT HE SUFFERED
WHEN HE FELL DOWN THE STAIRS AT
FOUR YEARS OLD. THE GOVERNMENT SAYS HIS POLICE
CONFESSION SHOWS JUST HOW
CALCULATED HE WAS. &gt;&gt; STABBED HIM IN THE HEART AND
IN THE LUNG, IN THE CHEST AND
THE THROAT, WENT DOWN TO THE GROUND, I SLIT HIS THROAT.
WHY?
I DO NOT KNOW. &gt;&gt; Sara: SAMPSON WAS CONVICTED
IN 2003 OF THREE.
ONCE THE CASE IS OVER THE JURY WILL ONCE AGAIN DECIDE TO
SENTENCE SAMPSON TO DEATH.
&gt;&gt; Gene: APPLICATION FOR MAN THAT SHOT TWO BOSTON POLICE
OFFICERS ONLY KNEW HIM FOR A FEW
HOURS. JONATHAN LOTT TOLD THE HERALD HE
MET CURT FIGUEROA WHEN MET FOR
INTERVIEW. HE SAYS IT IS NOT HIS FAULT IF
HE LIED DURING THE INTERVIEW.
IT IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. FIGUEROA CHARGED FOR
IMIMPERSONATING AN OFFICER.
IT IS NOT UNCOMMON TO MEET INTERVIEWERS AT MEET APPLICANTS
AT THE INTERVIEW.
&gt;&gt; Sara: MBTA FIGHTING AGAINST SEXUAL HARASSMENT TO KEEP RIDERS
SAFE.
THE "T" TEAMED UP WITH THE RAIN CRISIS CENTER AND OTHER GROUPS.
AS PART OF THE CAMPAIGN HUNDREDS
OF SIGNS HAVE BEEN POSTED AND POST CARDS HANDED OUT TO HELP
RAISE AWARENESS.
THEIR GOAL IS TO IMPROVE PASSENGER SAFETY AND ENCOURAGE
VICTIMS AND RIDERS TO REPORT
INCIDENTS. &gt;&gt; ONE PERSON VICTIMIZED IS ONE
TOO MANY.
MANY SURVIVORS OF THESE SEXUAL ASSAULTS HESITATE TO COME
FORWARD FOR THE FEAR OF BEING
BLAMED, NOT BEING BELIEVED. &gt;&gt; THE CAMPAIGN LAUNCHED
YESTERDAY AND WILL RUN THROUGH
FEBRUARY. &gt;&gt; Sara: MORE "T" RIDERS
COMPLAINING ABOUT DIRTY
STATIONS. DOZENS OF JANITORS LAID OFF IN
SEPTEMBER AND SINCE THEN
COMPLAINTS ABOUT TRASH, BAD SMELLS, DIRTY FLOORS AND
OVERFLOWING TRASH CANS JUMPED BY
50%. THE REMAINING WORKERS SIMPLY
CAN'T KEEP UP WITH THE WORKLOAD.
THE "T" SAYS IT REGULARLY INSPECTS THE STATIONS FOR
CLEANLINESS AND COMPLAINTS
REPRESENT A SMALL FRACTION OF ITS DAILY RIDERS.
&gt;&gt; Gene: TRAVELING ROUTE 128,
YOU MAY WANT TO SKIP ALTOGETHER IF YOU CAN.
MASS DOT WILL CLOSE PART OF THE
HIGHWAY TO HIGHLAND AVENUE BRIDGE.
HERE IS WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
ABOUT THE PROJECT. EXIT 19 AND STARTING TONIGHT AT
EIGHT.
THE NORTHBOUND SIDE WILL BE CLOSED.
SPAN THREE HOURS TOMORROW NIGHT
BOTH SIDES OF THE HIGHWAY WILL BE SHUT DOWN AND THEN STARTING
AT 6:00 TOMORROW NIGHT THE
SOUTHBOUND SIDE WILL REMAIN CLOSED.
SO TAKE IT SLOW, LOOK FOR
DETOURS, MASS DOT SAYS THE PROJECT SHOULD WRAP UP BY SUNDAY
AFTERNOON.
TWO WORDS FOR THAT, JULIE, DRIVING 128 ALTERNATE ROUTES.
&gt;&gt; Julie: I WAS GOING TO SAY
STAY HOME. WE ARE STILL OVER THE FUEL SPILL
THAT WE HAVE BEEN COVERING FOR
YOU. IT IS ON 93 NORTHBOUND BEFORE
ROUTE 62.
HOWEVER, THE ONLY I GUESS A LITTLE BIT OF GOOD NEWS DRIVE
TIME STILL MODERATE.
32 MINUTES ON 93 NORTH IN THE LEVERETT CONNECTOR UP TO 495.
SHIRI?
&gt;&gt; Shiri: CHECK BACK WITH YOU IN TEN, JULIE.
RIGHT NOW I GOT TEMPERATURES IN
THE 40s, SUN ABOUT TO COME UP. AS IT DOES YOU WILL FIND
CONDITIONS PRETTY BRIGHT,
ESPECIALLY THIS AFTERNOON. BRIGHT AND BREEZY AND
TEMPERATURES IN THE 50s AS YOU
COME HOME FROM WORK. I WILL SHOW YOU WHEN TO PLAN
AROUND 20s AND WHEN WE GOT
FLURRIES THIS WEEKEND COMING UP. &gt;&gt; Gene: 7:11.

      <description>&gt;&gt; Gene: RESEARCHERS AT B.U.
CALLING GAME CHANGE AND HER
PLAYING FOOTBALL AT FIVE YEARS OLD.
&gt;&gt; Daniel: PLAYED WITH
PATRIOTS FOR THREE SEASONS, LATER WITH THE EAGLES AND DIED
EARLIER THIS YEAR FROM WHAT
DOCTORS INITIALLY THOUGHT WAS ALS.
TURNER DONATED HIS BRAIN TO B.U.
MEDICAL TEAMS AND THEY DETERMINED HIS DEATH WAS NOT
CAUSED BY ALS BUT RATHER THE
RESULT OF REPEATED HEAD TRAUMA AND YEARS OF              PLAYING FOOTBALL.
&gt;&gt; SPINAL CORD SHOWING AT 46 AT
CTE. &gt;&gt; Daniel: FINDINGS LED TO
MOMENTS OF PALATABLE MOTION AS
THEY WERE DETAILED. &gt;&gt; RAYMOND AND MYRA TURNER.
&gt;&gt; REFLECTING ON LIFE CHOICE
THAT DRAMATICALLY ALTERED KEVIN ACE FATE.
&gt;&gt; CAN DESTROY A BRAIN THE WAY
WE HAVEN'T SEEN YET. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF THE
RECRUITING FIVE-YEAR-OLD AND NO
SAFE WAY TO HIT CHILD IN HEAD 500 TIMES A YEAR.
&gt;&gt; CLEAREST INDICATION CTE CAN
CAUSE THE SAME MOTOR NEURON DISEASE THAT SHOWS UP IN ALS
PATIENTS.
KEVIN TURNER WAS IN LEAD PLAINTIFF IN LAWSUIT AGAINST THE
NFL AND NOT SO MUCH ABOUT THE
MONEY BUT LETTING PARENTS KNOW THE DANGERS OF PLAYING FOOTBALL
SO EARLY.
JULIE. &gt;&gt; Gene: IT WASN'T JUST
TURNER.
&gt;&gt; Daniel: 17 OTHER PLAYERS HAD ALS AND TURNED OUT TO BE C
CTE.
&gt;&gt; Sara: NEWLY DISCOVERED VIRAL MUTATION WHY SO MANY
INFECTED WITH EBOLA IN AFRICA.
THE MUTATION SITS AT THE TOP OF THE VIRUS MAKING IT EASIER FOR
THE DISEASE TO ENTER HUMAN
CELLS. THEY WERE LOOKING AT PROTEIN
FOUND IN HIV WHEN THEY
DISCOVERED A SIMILAR TYPE OF PROTEIN IN THE MOST DOMINANT
FORM OF THE EBOLA VIRUS.
THE OUTBREAK INFECTED MORE THAN 28,000 PEOPLE IN WEST AFRICA.
&gt;&gt; Julie: HAVE ONE LANE
BLOCKED AS OPPOSED TO TWO NORTHBOUND LANES AND TRUCK OVER
ON THE RIGHT-HAND SHOULDER.
SO THINGS STARTING TO LOOK A LITTLE BIT BETTER ON 93
NORTHBOUND.
SOUTHBOUND RIDERS AND DRIVERS THOUGH A LITTLE BIT SLOW THERE
AND TAPPING THE BREAKS TO SEE
WHAT EXACTLY IS GOING ON. AS WE SHIFT SLIGHTLY SOUTHBOUND
THINGS SLOW GOING ON THE
BRAINTREE SPLIT TO COLUMBIA ROAD.
HERE ARE LIVE DRIVE TIMES, 37
MINUTES ON PIKE EASTBOUND FROM 495 TO MASS AVE.
HALF HOUR ON EXPRESSWAY, ALMOST
AN HOUR ON 93 SOUTHBOUND FROM 495 TO THE LEVERETT CONNECTOR.
METEOROLOGIST SHIRI SPEAR
JOINING US NOW. SHIRI, YOU'RE SAYING SORRY, NO
MORE 60s, BUT THINGS WILL BE
NICE AND BRIGHT OUT THERE. &gt;&gt; Shiri: 60s AREN'T
EXPECTED THIS TIME OF YEAR SO
NOT EXACTLY A SHOCK BUT TEMPERATURES WELL BELOW AVERAGE
HERE INTO THE WEEKEND, PLUS
TODAY WE GOT WIND GUSTING 20, 30 MILES PER HOUR WHICH ADDS
EXTRA CHILL TO THE AIR AND
REMEMBER CLOCKS FALL BACK THIS SUNDAY MORNING WHICH MEANS GAIN
AN EXTRA HOUR OF SLEEP BUT ALSO
MEANS THE SUNSET HERE ON SUNDAY EVENING IS 4:30 AND THAT'S GOING
TO TAKE SOME ADJUSTING.
RIGHT NOW LOOKING AT MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES IN BOSTON, 48Â° AND
LAWRENCE AT 46, NORWOOD AT 45.
SO DRESSING FOR THE 40s, SO NOT TOO COLD THIS MORNING, JUST
A LITTLE BIT COOL OUT THERE, THE
WIND NOT TOO ACTIVE YET BUT NOW THAT THE SUN IS COMING UP, WIND
WILL BE STRENGTHENING AND TELL
GUSTS THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH LATE-MORNING THROUGH THE
AFTERNOON.
SO BY 9:00 A.M. 48Â°, 11:00 A.M. THIS GOES FOR NORWOOD, 53, GOT
HIGHS TODAY IN THE MID TO UPPER
50s. WE GOT A LOT OF AFTERNOON SUN.
THE ONE EXCEPTION I COULD SEE
WOULD BE THE CAPE OR MAY END UP WITH OCEAN EFFECT CLOUDS
ANYWHERE HYANNIS EASTWARD.
TEMPERATURE IN THE MID-50s BOSTON, OVER TO WORCESTER AT
50Â°, MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
51 AND 57 THOUGH IN NORWOOD, 59Â° IN NEW BEDFORD.
YOU CAN COMPARE THAT TO THE 70
DEGREE READING THAT WE HAD OUT OF NEW BEDFORD YESTERDAY, SO IT
IS AT LEAST TENÂ° COOLER HERE
THIS AFTERNOON. TOMORROW TON OF 50s ON THE MAP
FOR HIGHS AND BEVERLY AND BOSTON
AND PLYMOUTH, OVER TO FOXBOROUGH, UP TO NASHUA AND
THEN WE START LOSING SOME HEAT
ON SUNDAY. SO SUNDAY ENDS UP BEING THE
COOLER AFTERNOON.
THIS IS HOW FUTURE CAST BREAKS DOWN TODAY AND BRIGHTEN UP AND
TURN BREEZY THIS AFTERNOON AND
PRETTY EASY GOING WITH NO TEMPERATURES OUT THERE AND
POTENTIAL FOR A QUICK FLURRY OR
QUICK SPRINKLE SATURDAY MORNING. DON'T WANT TO OVERTALK IT
BECAUSE IT IS A VERY SLIGHT RISK
OUT THERE AND DON'T WANT YOU TO BE SURPRISED IF ANY ACTIVITY
WILL BE INCREDIBLY PATCHY HERE
ON SATURDAY, MOST OF THE WEEKEND JUST LOOKS LIKE THAT.
PARTLY CLOUDY AND SAME DEAL HERE
ON SUNDAY. SUNDAY THOUGH BEST BET FOR ANY
KIND OF SPRINKLE WOULD BE ALONG
THE COASTLINE. GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT
BRIGHTER FURTHER INLAND.
JUST UPDATED THIS, WENT THROUGH FOLIAGE REPORTS, LOOKS LIKE A
LOT OF COLOR NORTH AND WEST OF
BOSTON KIND OF PAST AT THIS POINT, BEST BET FOR COLOR,
EASTERN IN PARTICULAR,
SOUTHEASTERN MASSACHUSETTS, 7-DAY FORECAST NOW WITH THE
WEEKEND ALWAYS IN VIEW AND
WEEKEND IS GOING TO BE CHILLY. WAKE UP TEMPERATURES 20s AND
30s, HIGHS ONLY AROUND 50, WE
GOT SUN AND 54 ON MONDAY AND NICE BRIGHT TUESDAY FOLLOWED BY
THE NEXT CHANCE OF SHOWERS HERE
ON WEDNESDAY. GENE, BACK OVER TO YOU.
&gt;&gt; Gene: FIRST TIME SINCE THE
INFAMOUS RNC SPEECH MELANIA TRUMP IS HEADING THE CAMPAIGN
TRAIL.

ADVOCATE FOR WOMEN AND CHILDREN.
THE FIRST SPEECH IN PUBLIC

NEEDS TO MAKE A CHANGE.
&gt;&gt; OUR CULTURE HAS GOTTEN TOO MEAN AND TOO ROUGH.
WE HAVE TO FIND A BETTER WAY TO
TALK WITH EACH OTHER, TO DISAGREE WITH EACH REMEMBER, TO
SPEAK TO EACH OTHER.
&gt;&gt; THIS MORNING SOME ARE CRITICIZING TRUMP.
THEY CALLED FOR AN END TO
BULLYING SHE NEVER ADDRESSED HER HUSBAND'S REMARKS TO WOMEN

QUESTIONS LOOMING OF A PERSON
STRUCK AND KILLED BY A CAR ON 128.
THE PERSON WAS WALKING ON THE
HIGHWAY BEFORE BEING HIT. FOX25'S JESSICA REYES LIVE IN
WALTHAM AND POLICE HAD H TO
CLOSE THREE LANES IN THAT SPOT FOR SHOWERS OVERNIGHT.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THEY DID, GENE.
THEY ACTUALLY JUST OPENED THE THREE LANES BACK UP AT 1:00
THIS MORNING AND OUT HERE FOR
SEVERAL HOURS LOOKING INTO THIS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THIS
ALL HAPPENED.
IT IS A VERY, VERY TOUGH SCENE AROUND 11 WHEN THIS FIRST

MIDDLE LANE OF THE HIGHWAY WAS
HIT BY ONE CAR AND HIT BY SEVERAL OTHERS PASSING BY.

WITH DAMAGE TO THE HOOD THERE.
THE BIG RESPONSE FROM POLICE LAST NIGHT.
AROUND HERE FOR SEVERAL HOURS
TRYING TO RE-CREATE THE ACCIDENT SCENE AND TRYING TO
DETERMINE WHAT EXACTLY LED UP
TO THIS. THREE LANES OF THE SOUTHBOUND
SIDES OF 128 WERE CLOSED LAST
NIGHT. AS THEY DID THEIR INITIAL
INVESTIGATION HERE AND ONCE
AGAIN, THE ROAD DID JUST OPEN BACK UP COMPLETELY AT 1:00 IN
THE MORNING.
STILL A LOT OF QUESTIONS OF WHAT EXACTLY LED UP TO THIS.
WE DID REACH OUT TO STATE
POLICE AND SO FAR HAD SAID THAT THE ROAD WILL OPEN BACK UP A
COUPLE OF HOURS AGO AND WORKING
TO IDENTIFY THE VICTIMS. WORKING TO LOCATE THEIR FAMILY
MEMBERS AND STILL TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY WERE DOING WALKING ALONG THIS STRETCH OF

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; BACK AT 6:14.
MONTHS AFTER A FORMER PATRIOTS
PLAYER PASSED AWAY EXPERTS ARE LINKING HIS DEATH TO THE YEARS
OF PLAYING FOOTBALL.
ALL STEMS FROM NEW RESEARCH AT BU THAT SOME ARE CALLING A GAME
CHANGER.
DANIEL MILLER JOINS US. DOCTORS SAY THIS GOES ALL THE
WAY BACK WHEN HE STARTED
PLAYING FOOTBALL AT 5 YEARS OLD.
&gt;&gt; Daniel:  KEVIN TURNER WAS A
STEREOTYPICAL FULLBACK THAT LOWERED HIS HEAD AND RAN PEOPLE
OVER.
HE PLAYED WITH THE EAGLES AND DIED FROM WHAT OFFICIALS
THOUGHT WAS ALS.
HE DONATED HIS RAIN WITH TO THE BU MEDICAL TEAM, AND THEY
DETERMINED HIS DEATH WAS NOT
CAUSED BY ALS BUT RATHER THE RESULT OF REPEATED HEAD TRAUMA
FROM HIS YEARS OF PLAYING
FOOTBALL. &gt;&gt; THE QUESTION WAS ALWAYS IS
THIS REALLY ALS OR IS THIS CTE?
&gt;&gt; Reporter: DRIVEN BY THAT QUESTION, RESEARCHERS AT BOSTON
UNIVERSITY CTE CENTER AND THE
VA  BOSTON HEALTH CARE SYSTEM CAME TO A DRAMATIC CONCLUSION.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THE CELLS THAT RUN
WITH THEIR AXIOMS TO THE SPINAL CORD WERE DESTROYED IN THE
BRAIN OF A CTE.
THIS IS WHAT A 65-YEAR-OLD AND HIS BRAIN AT 46.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS RAYMOND AND MYRA
TURNER. &gt;&gt; Daniel:  RAYMOND AND MYRA
TURN REMEMBER DEALING WITH THE
PREMATURE LOSS OF THEIR SON, REFLECTING ON THE LIFE CHOICE
THAT DRAMATICALLY ALTERED
KEVIN'S FATE. &gt;&gt; I WAS A COACH, AND YOU HIT
WITH YOUR HEAD, THAT'S THE WAY
YOU PLAY FOOTBALL. &gt;&gt; WHAT KEVIN TURNER'S CASE IF
YOU START AT 5 YEARS OLD AND
SUCCESSFUL FOR 25 YEARS, IT CAN CONTROL YOUR BRAIN IN A WAY WE
HAVEN'T SEEN YET.
&gt;&gt; THE ANSWER TO MINIMIZING THIS FROM THE RESEARCHER'S
POINT OF VIEW IS
STRAIGHTFORWARD. &gt;&gt; I THINK THE NFL HAS GOT TO
GET OUT OF THE GAME.PROMOTING
AND MARKETING AND RECRUITING 5-YEAR-OLDS TO THE GAME.
&gt;&gt; I THINK WE SHOWED THERE IS
NO SAFE WAY TO HIT A CHILD 500 TIME IN A YEAR WHILE THEIR
BRAIN IS STILL DEVELOPING.
&gt;&gt; CTE CAN CAUSE THE SAME MOTOR NEURON DISEASE THAT SHOWS UP IN
ALS PATIENTS.
HE WAS THE LEAD PLAINTIFF IN A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE NFL AND AT
THIS POINT NOT SO MUCH ABOUT
THE MONEY BUT EDUCATING THE PUBLIC OF THE DANGERS OF
PLAYING TACKLE FOOTBALL TOO
EARLY.</description>

NORTHEASTERN STUDENT.
THE 21-YEAR-OLD FROM NEW JERSEY SAYS SHE WAS RAPE BY A

HAPPENED TO CAMPUS POLICE, BUT
OTHER STUDENT WAS NOT PROSECUTED.

HELFMAN.
HELFMAN SAID THE SCHOOL'S INVESTIGATION MADE HER FEEL
VICTIMIZED AGAIN

INAPPROPRIATE AND THINKING
ABOUT IT NOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE GOT TO
GO THROUGH THIS AS WELL.

MISREPRESENTS THE NUMBER OF
SEXUAL ASSAULTS ON CAMPUS AND FAILS TO FOLLOW STATE AND
FEDERAL LAWS ABOUT REPORTING
CRIMES. NORTHEASTERN SAID THEY CAN'T
COMMENT BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT
BEEN SERVED A COMPLAINT. AND DOES SAY THAT STUDENT
SAFETY IS A SCHOOL'S PRIORITY.

      <description>BRING US AN UPDATE AS SOON AS
WE GET IT, SARA.
&gt;&gt;&gt; HARVARD UNIVERSITY HAS SUSPENDED THE MEN'S SOCCER TEAM
FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON ALL
OVER A SO-CALLED SCOUTING REPORT THAT RATED THE PLAYERS
ON THE WOMEN'S TEAM BASE AND
THEIR LOOKS. CATHERINE PARROTTA IS LIVE FROM
HARVARD.
THE SCHOOL'S PRESIDENT SAYS THIS IS NOT A ONE-TIME
INCIDENT.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THEY ARE TAKING THIS SO SERIOUSLY AND.
THE TEAM HAD ANOTHER GAME THEY
WERE SUPPOSED TO PLAY AGAINST COLUMBIA SATURDAY.
IF THEY HAD WON THAT GAME THEY
WOULD HAVE BEEN HEADED TO THE NAACP TOURNAMENT AND THAT IS
NOT GOING TO BE HAPPENING AND
THE PRESIDENT SAID BECAUSE THEY TAKE THIS BEHAVIOR SERIOUSLY.
THIS DECISION WAS MADE TO
CANCEL THE REST OF THE SEASON AFTER ALLEGATIONS SURFACED
ABOUT THE MEN'S SOCCER TEAM.
THE MEN WERE RATING FEMALE SOCCER PLAYERS BASED ON THEIR
LOOKS.
THE HARVARD NEWSPAPER REPORTED LAST MONTH THAT THE ACCUSATIONS
STARTED WITH THE 2012 TEAM, BUT
FOX25 LEARNED THE RANKING SYSTEMS WERE HAVE TRADITION AND
CONTINUED.
THEY REACTED TO THE SUSPENSION. &gt;&gt; EMBARRASSING FOR THE COLLEGE
AS A WHOLE.
WITH THE VALUES THAT THE COLLEGE REALLY TRIES TO EXEMPT
FLY.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: IN A STATE TO FOX25, HARVARD'S PRESIDENT SAID
I WAS DEEPLY DISTRESSED TO
LEARN THAT THE APPALLING ACTIONS OF THE MEN'S SOCCER
TEAM WAS NOT ISOLATED TO ONE
YEAR OR THE ACTIONS OF A FEW INDIVIDUALS AND HARVARD SAID IT
WOULD BE EDUCATING STUDENT
ATHLETES ON THE CAMPUS ESPECIALLY THOSE ON THE MEN'S
SOCCER TEAM.
AGAIN THEIR SEASON HAS NOW ENDED.
LIVE AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY,

WE LOVE SHIRI, BUT WE DON'T LOVE THE COOLER TEMPERATURES SO
MUCH.
&gt;&gt; Shiri:  THE COOLER TEMPERATURES AND ALL WEEK HAVE
BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS EARLY
MORNING SUNSET. NOT LOVING IT EASTERNLY.
&gt;&gt; Gene:  WHO IS AT 4:30.
NOW 4:32. &gt;&gt; Shiri:  SO EVERYTHING TODAY
IS KIND OF AN HOUR AHEAD OF US
BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T CHANGED THE CLOCKS YET, BUT ON SUNDAY --
BEFORE YOU GO TO BED ON
SATURDAY, YOU CHANGE THE CLOCKS BACK AND AN EXTRA HOUR OF
SLEEP, BUT MEANS THAT THE SUN
COMES UP AT 6:24. SUNSET AT 4:31.
THAT SUNSET IS REALLY EARLY.
CLOSE EYE ON THIS FRONT. THAT FRONT WILL COME THROUGH
AND BRING A CUP OF CLOUDS OUR
WAY THIS MORNING AND I HAVE GOT PARTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS THIS
MORNING.
NOT OVERCAST AND TOSSING IN A COUPLE OF CLOUDS MIXING THEM IN
AT 10 A.M.
AFTER THAT THE AFTERNOON BRIGHTENS UP.
THE ONLY SPOT FOR LINGERING

PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES. SLIGHT RISK FOR A LITTLE
DRIZZLE OR A TEMPERATURE IN.
THE BEST THAT WILL ACTUALLY BE IN SOME OF THE HIGHER
ELEVATIONS LIKE THE WORCESTER
HILLS OR THE BROOKSHIRES OR THE MANANOCKS.
KEEPING SHOWER AND TEMPERATURE
IN CHANCES VERY SLIGHT ON BOTH DAYS OVER THE WEEKEND AND WINDS
COMING IN OFF THE WATER AND YOU
WILL FIND MORE CLOUDS ALONG THE COASTLINE AND WHERE YOU HAVE
THE BEST SHOT OF SEEING A STRAY
SPRINKLE. THE FURTHER WEST YOU GO, THE
BRIGHTER IT WILL GET.
WE ARE IN STORE FOR A SEE SENT AND CHILLY WEATHER.
-- DECENT AND CHILLY WEATHER.
50s BOTH DAYS ON THE CAPE. THE SEVEN-DAY FORECAST WITH THE
WEEKEND ALWAYS IN VIEW AS

CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT OVER SMARTPHONES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN
RECALLED.
THE CALIFORNIA LAW FIRM THAT CLAIMS THEIR PHONES CAUGHT ON
FIRE.
THE GALAXY NOTE 5 AND S AND S 7 MODELS DIFFER FROM THE GALAXY
NOTE 7 WHICH WAS RECALLED
EARLIER THIS YEAR. ONE CUSTOMER SAYS HIS PHONE
OVERHEATS OFTEN AND TERRIFIED
THAT IT WILL BURST INTO FLAMES. &gt;&gt; I FEEL UNEASY, ANXIOUS.
IT FORCES ME -- BECAUSE I DON'T
WANT SOMETHING TO GO HAY WIRE TO TAKE IT OFF OF THE STAND AND
TUT IT IN FRONT OF THE AIR

THREE MODELS AND REIMBURSE

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; AN ENTIRE TOWN TURNING ON
THEIR FAUCET TO FIND THIS,
THEIR WATER IS BROWN AND UNSAFE TO DRINK.
NEIGHBORS TELL US A PROBLEM
THEY HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH ON AND OFF FOR NEARLY A DECADE.
FOX25'S DANIEL MILLER JOINS US
WITH THE PROBLEM AND THE BUSH TO GET -- AND THE PUSH TO GET
THIS FIXED.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: SO FULL OF IRON AND MAGNA KNEES THAT -- MANGE
GA KNEES.
AND IT COMES THROUGH THE TOILET.
SHE IS THE MOM OF TWO KIDS AND
A WIFE OF A FOX25 EMPLOYEE WHO ALERTED US OF THE PROBLEM.
THEY ARE FED UP BECAUSE THEY
HAVE NO USABLE WATER AT HOME. THE PROBLEM IS SO BAD THAT THE
WATER DEPARTMENT HAS TO COME TO
PEOPLE'S THOMS FLUSH THE NEARBY HYDRANTS TOO CLEAN OUT THE
GUNK.
&gt;&gt; I CAN'T GIVE THEM BATHS. BRUSH THEIR TEETH WITH BOTTLED
WATER.
I CAN'T WASH LAUNDRY. &gt;&gt; NO REAL SOLUTION.
THE TOWN HAS NO WATER TREATMENT
FACILITY. THE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL
PROTECTION MANDATES THAT THE
TOWN FLUSHES TWICE A YEAR FOR SAFETY AND THESE DAYS HAPPENING
ONCE A WEEK.
WATER AUTHORITIES SAY THE GOAL IS TO HAVE A WATER TREATMENT
PLANT AND THE SITE PLANNED FOR
THE FACILITY MAY HAVE CONNECTIONS TO THE WAMPANOAG
INDIAN TRIBE SO IT FIRST HAS TO
PASS INSPECTION WHICH IS SCHEDULED FOR NEXT TUESDAY.
NOW IF THAT SITE PASSES
INSPECTION, THEN GROUNDBREAKING WILL HAPPEN IN THE SPRING OF
NEXT YEAR AND THEN ANOTHER 18
MONTHS BEFORE IT IS IN OPERATION.

BATTLE WITH THE U.S. ARMY
RESERVE IS OVER AND THEY WON. WE TOLD WITH YOU CAPTAIN SHANE
MORGAN A FEW WEEKS AGO.
A YEAR AGO CAPTAINING MORE- A HEART ATTACK DOING PUSH-UPS AT
FORT DEVENS.
THE ARMY RULED THAT THE HEART ATTACK WAS NOT IN THE LINE OF

HAS BEEN REVERSED.
&gt;&gt; IN THE PAST YEAR WE HAVE BEEN LIVING UNDER THE CLOUD AND
ALL OF A SUDDEN IT FEELS LIKE
WE ARE FREE. &gt;&gt; CAPTAIN MORGAN SAYS HIS
MEDICAL BILLS TOTAL $1,000.
IT THE ARMY WILL PAY ALL OF IT INCLUDING OUT-OF-POCKET
EXPENSES NOT COVERED BY HIS

LETTER TO CONGRESS LAST WEEK ABOUT THE CLINTON E-MAIL
INVESTIGATION.
IN THE WAKE OF THAT REVELATION, CLINTON SAW HER SUPPORT DROP BY
2 POINTS SINCE SUFFOLK'S LAST
POLL, BUT TRUMP'S NUMBERS DID NOT RISE.
BOTH CANDIDATES CAMPAIGNED IN
THE CAROLINAS YESTERDAY. &gt;&gt; WE KNOW HILLARY CAN'T BE
TRUSTED.
WE LEARNED THAT WITH AMERICA'S SECURITY.
YOU LOOK AT HER E-MAIL
SITUATION. CAN WE TRUST HER WITH OUR
SECURITY?
&gt;&gt; ITS BEA WHO WE ARE. IT IS ABOUT WHAT WE WANT.
WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO TO MAKE
OUR MARK ON OUR COUNTRY AT THIS TIME IN OUR HISTORY!
&gt;&gt; Reporter: AGAIN, THE RACE TO
IS LOOKING TO INCLUDE NEW HAMPSHIRE'S FOUR ELECTORAL
VOTES.
DONALD TRUMP'S EVENT IN ATKINSON STARTS IN NOON, AND
THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE WILL BE
BACK IN MANCHESTER ON MONDAY. HILLARY CLINTON WILL CAMPAIGN
IN MANCHESTER ON SUNDAY, AND
CHELSEA CLINTON WILL BE IN THE STATE TOMORROW AND OBAMA WILL
STUMP FOR HIS FORMER SECRETARY
OF STATE AT UNH ON MONDAY. LIVE IN ATKINSON, NEW
HAMPSHIRE, MICHAEL HENRICH,

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; MELANIA TRUMP HIT THE
CAMPAIGN TRAIL LAYING OUT HER
VISION AS FIRST LADY. SHE WOULD FOCUS ON COMBATING
ONLINE BULLYING AND SERVE AS AN
ADVOCATE FOR WOMEN AND CHILDREN.
THE FIRST PUBLIC SPEECH SINCE
THE CONVENTION. SHE SAID THE NATION AS A WHOLE
NEEDS TO MAKE A CHANGE.
&gt;&gt; OUR CULTURE HAS GOTTEN TOO MEAN AND TOO ROUGH.
WE HAVE TO FIND A BETTER WAY TO
TALK TO EACH OTHER, TO DISAGREE WITH EACH OTHER, TO RESPECT
EACH OTHER.
&gt;&gt; Gene:  THIS MORNING SOME ARE CRITICIZING TRUMP WHILE SHE
CALLED FOR AN END OF BULLYING,
SHE NEVER ADDRESSED HER HUSBAND'S OWN REMARKS TOWARD
WOMEN BOTH IN HIS SPEECHES AND
ON SOCIAL MEDIA.</description>

FOR EARLY VOTING IN
MASSACHUSETTS, AND STATE OFFICIALS SAY IF YOU ARE
PLANNING ON VOTING TODAY, MAKE
SURE TO CHECK WHAT TIME THE POLLS CLOSE IN YOUR TOWN.
TOWNS WERE ALLOWED TO SET THEIR
OWN HOURS AND MANY HAVE HALF DAYS ON FRIDAY.
SECRETARY OF STATE BILL GALVIN
ASK SOME TOWNS TO EXTEND THEIR HOURS AND SOME HAVE.
SO FAR MORE THAN $800,000
PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF EARLY VOTING AND OFFICIALS
THINK THAT NUMBER COULD SURPASS
$1 MILLION. WE ARE FOUR DAYS AWAY FROM THE
ELECTION.

      <description>4 P.M. AND LASTING THROUGHOUT
THE NIGHT.
&gt;&gt;&gt; NOW 5:04 THIS MORNING. QUESTIONS LOOM BEING A PERSON
WHO WAS STRUCK AND KILLED BY A
CAR ON 128. STATE POLICE SAY THE PERSON WAS
WALKING ON THE HIGHWAY BEFORE
BEING HIT. FOX25'S JESSICA REYES IS LIVE
IN WALTHAM THIS MORNING, AND,
JESS, STATE POLICE HAD TO CLOSE THREE LANES IN THAT SPOT FOR
HOURS OVERNIGHT.
&gt;&gt; YEAH, WE ACTUALLY HEARD FROM STATE POLICE, AND THEY SAY THEY
OPENED THE HIGHWAY ONCE AGAIN
AT 1:00 THIS MORNING JUST A CUP OF HOURS AGO AND THE
INVESTIGATION DID LAST FOR
SEVERAL HOURS LAST NIGHT AND WE KNOW THIS WAS A VERY TOUGH
SCENE ON 128 SOUTH LAST NIGHT.
POLICE SAY THAT THIS PERSON WAS HIT BY ONE CAR AND THEN HIT BY
SEVERAL OTHERS AS THEY PASS BY.
WE WILL HAVE VIDEO FROM THE SCENE WE WANT TO SHOW YOU NOW
AND IN THIS VIDEO, WE CAN SEE
ONE OF THE CARS THAT LOOKED TO BE INVOLVED WITH SOME DAMAGE TO
THE HOOD THERE.
POLICE SAY THIS PERSON WASN'T WALKING ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD
BUT WAS ACTUALLY HIT IN THE
MIDDLE LANE OF 128 SOUTH. THERE WAS A HUGE RESPONSE FROM
POLICE.
THEY WERE OUT HERE FOR SEVERAL HOURS LAST NIGHT WORKING TO
RE-CREATE THE ACCIDENT SCENE,
AS WE SAID THREE LANES OF THE SOUTHBOUND SIDE OF 128 WERE
CLOSED LAST NIGHT AS WE DID
THEIR INITIAL INVESTIGATION FOR SEVERAL HOURS HERE LAST NIGHT.
SO A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT
WHAT EXACTLY LED UP TO THIS. WE ARE WORKING WITH STATE
POLICE THIS MORNING TO LEARN
MORE ABOUT WHO THIS VICTIM IS AND WHAT EXACTLY THEY WERE
DOING ON THE SIDE OF THE
HIGHWAY HERE. AND WE DID JUST HEAR BACK FROM
THEM.
ONE QUICK UPDATE THAT THE ROAD REOPENED AT 1:00 THIS MORNING
ANDS IN WE LEARNED MORE
THROUGHOUT THE MORNING, WE WILL KEEP THEM POSTED ON THE FOX25
NEWS.
LIVE IN WALTHAM, JESSICA REYES,</description>

GRADER WHO BROUGHT A GUN TO
SCHOOL IS FACING CHARGES BUT THE GUN DID NOT BELONG TO HIM.
THE 8-YEAR-OLD BROUGHT THE
.25-CALIBER PISTOL, PULLED IT OUT OF HIS BACK PACK AND SHOWED
IT TO SEVERAL CLASSMATES.
THE BOY THOUGHT IT WAS A TOY. HE FOUND THE GUN IN A BOX THAT
BELONGED TO A RELATIVE.
THE RELATIVE'S HOME HAD BURNED IN A FIRE AND THE BOY'S FAMILY
WAS HOLDING ON TO SOME OF THEIR
BELONGINGS. THE PARENTS OF THE BOY'S SCHOOL
WERE UPSET WHAT HAPPENED.

SAMPSON IS BACK IN COURT 13 YEARS AFTER HIS DEATH SENTENCE
WAS THROWN OUT IN A

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; 5:14 THIS MORNING.
MONTHS AFTER A FORMER PATRIOTS
PLAYER PASSED AWAY, EXPERTS ARE LINKING HIS DEATH TO HIS YEARS
OF PLAYING FOOTBALL.
ALL STEMS FROM PLAYING RESEARCH AT BU THAT SOME ARE CALLING A
GAME CHANGER.
FOX25'S DANIEL MILLER JOINS US. AND DOCTORS SAY THIS GOES ALL
THE WAY BACK TO WHEN HE STARTED
PLAYING FOOTBALL AT JUST FIVE YEARS OLD.
&gt;&gt; YEAH, GENE.
KEVIN TURNER WAS A TER YO TYPICAL FULLBACK THAT LOWERED
HIS HEAD AND RAN PEOPLE OVER.
HE PLAYED FOR THE PATRIOTS FOR THREE SEASONS AND DIED EARLIER
THIS FREER FROM WHAT DOCTORS
INITIALLY THOUGHT WAS ALS. TURNERER DONATED HIS BRAIN TO
THE BU MEDICAL TEAM AND THEY
DETERMINED THAT HIS DEATH WAS NOT BROUGHT BY ALS  BUT RATHER
THE RESULT OF REPEATED HEAD
TRAUMA FROM YEARS OF PLAYING FOOTBALL.
&gt;&gt; THE QUESTION IS IS THIS
REALLY ALS OR CTE? &gt;&gt; Reporter: DIFFERENT BY THAT
QUESTION, RESEARCHERS AT BOSTON
UNIVERSITY'S CTE CENTER AND THE VA BOSTON HEALTH CARE SYSTEM
DIME A DRAMATIC CONCLUSION.
&gt;&gt; THE CELLS THAT RUN WITH THEIR AXIOMS ALL WAIT TO THEIR
SPINAL CORD THEY WERE DESTROYED
IN HIS BRAIN BY CTE. THIS IS WHAT THE BRAIN OF A
60-YEAR-OLD SHOULD LOOK LIKE,
AND THIS IS KEVIN'S BRAIN AT 46.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: FINDINGS UNVEILED
LED TO MOMENTS OF PALPABLE EMOTIONS AS THEY WERE DETAILED.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS RAYMOND AND MYRA
TURNER. &gt;&gt; Reporter: RAY MONLD AND MYRA
TURN REMEMBER STILL DEALING
WITH THE PREMATURE LOSS OF THEIR SON, REFLECTING ON THE
LIFE CHOICE THAT DRAMATICALLY
ALTERED KEVIN'S FATE. &gt;&gt; I WAS A COACH.
AND YOU HIT WITH YOUR HEAD.
THAT'S WHERE YOU PLAY FOOTBALL. &gt;&gt; KEVIN TURNER'S CASE SHOWED
IF YOU START AT 5 YEARS OLD AND
YOU ARE SUCCESSFUL AND 25 YEARS, WITH IT CAN DESTROY YOUR
BRAIN IN A WAY THAT WE HAVEN'T
SEEN YET. &gt;&gt; Reporter: THE ANSWER TO
MINIMIZING THIS PROBLEM FROM
THE RESEARCHER'S POINT OF VIEW IS STRAIGHTFORWARD.
&gt;&gt; I THINK THE NFL HAS GOT OUT
TO OF THE GAME OF PROMOTING AND RECRUITING AND MARKETING
5-YEAR-OLDS TO THIS GAME.
WE HAVE SEEN THERE IS NO SAFE WAY TO HIT A CHILD IN THE HEAD
500 TIMES A YEAR WHILE THEIR
BRAIN STILL DEVELOPING. &gt;&gt; Daniel:  CLEAREST INDICATION
THAT CTE CAN CAUSE THE MOTOR
NEURON DISEASE THAT SHOWS UP IN PATIENTS.
KEVB TURNER WAS THE LEAD
PLAINTIFF IN A CONCUSSION LAWSUIT AGAINST THE NFL.
NOT SO MUCH ABOUT THE MONEY
THEN EDUCATING THE PUBLIC OF THE DANGER OF PLAYING TACKLE
FOOTBALL TOO EARLY.

&gt;&gt;&gt; A NEWLY DISCOVERED VIRAL
MUTATION IS THE REASON SO MANY PEOPLE WERE AFFECTED WITH EBOLA

SITS AT THE TOP OF THE VIRUS
MAKING IT EASIER FOR THE DISEASE TO ENTER HUMAN CELLS.

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; IT IS GAME OVER FOR HARVARD
MEN'S SOCCER TEAM.
THE REST OF THE SEASON HAS BEEN SUSPENDED OVER A SO-CALLED
SCOUTING REPORT.
THE REPORT RATES PLAYERS ON THE WOMEN'S TEAM BASED ON THEIR
LOOKS.
FOX25'S CATHERINE PARROTTA IS LIVE AT HARVARD, MORE DETAILS
ON THE INVESTIGATION.
CATHERINE ALL STARTED WITH AN INCIDENT FOUR YEARS AGO.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THE DECISION TO
SUSPEND THE TEAM FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON IS A SERIOUS ONE
AND REFLECTS HARVARD'S VIEW
THAT THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR WAS UNACCEPTABLE AND THE DECISION
TO SUSPEND THE MEN'S SOCCER
TEAM WAS MADE AFTER THESE ALLEGATIONS SURFACED AND
DISCOVERED THE TEAM WAS
ALLEGEDLY RATING FEMALE SOCCER PLAYERS BASED ON THEIR LOOKS.
WASN'T A NEW ALLEGATIONS.
FIRST REPORTED LAST MONTH THAT THESE ACCUSATIONS START BACK
WITH THE 2012 TEAM.
FOX25 LEARNED THE RANKING SYSTEM BECAME A TRADITION AND
HAS CONTINUED.
STUDENTS REACTED TO THE TEAM'S SUSPENSION.
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT IS DEFINITELY AN
EMBARRASSING THING FOR THE COLLEGE AS A WHOLE.
I THINK WITH THE VALUES THAT --
THAT THE COLLEGE REALLY TRIED TO EXEMPT FLY.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: IN A STATEMENT TO
FOX25, HARVARD'S PRESIDENT SAID I WAS DEEPLY DISTRESSED TO
LEARN THAT THE APPALLING ACTION
OF THE 2012 MEN'S SOCCER TEAM WAS NOT ISOLATED TO ONE YEAR OR
THE ACTIONS OF A FEW
INDIVIDUALS. WE DON'T KNOW HOW BROAD THIS
IS.
HOW MANY PEOPLE IN THE SOCCER TEAM WAS PARTICIPATING IN THIS
TYPE OF BEHAVIOR AND HARVARD
SAYS WILL CONTINUE TO EDUCATE MORE OF THE STUDENT ATHLETES
PARTICULARLY THOSE OF MEN'S
SOCCER TEAM.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; WELCOME BACK.
AN ENTIRE TOWN TURNING ON TAPS
TO FIND THIS MESS. THE WATER IN NORTON IS BROWN
AND THE TOWN IS WORKING FAST TO
CATCH UP WITH THE PROBLEM. JACQUI HEINRICH GOT A
FIRST-HAND LOOK AT THE PROBLEM
AND THE COST. &gt;&gt; I AM SORRY TO SHOW YOU MY
TOILET, BUT THAT'S MY TOILET.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: YOU OVER IN KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO GET IN
NORTON.
&gt;&gt; THAT FLUSHED. OH, GOD.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THE TOWN'S WATER
SUPPLY FULL OF IRON AND MAG KNEES IT COMES THROUGH PEOPLE'S
TAPS, TOILETS, CLOSETS AND EVEN
WASHING MACHINES. PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE ARE FED
UP.
SHELL CHRISTIE, WIFE OF A FOX25 EMPLOYEE, HAS TWO KIDS AND WITH
NO USABLE WATER AT HOME.
&gt;&gt; I CAN'T GIVE THEM BATHS TONIGHT.
THEY HAVE TO BRUSH THEIR TEETH
WITH BOTTLED WATER. I CAN'T WASH LAUNDRY.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: SUCH A PROBLEM
THAT THE WATER DEPARTMENT HAS TO COME TO PEOPLE'S HOMES TO
FLUSH NEARBY HYDRANTS TO CLEAN
OUT THE GUNK BECAUSE RIGHT NOW NO REAL SOLUTION.
THE TOWN HAS NO WATER TREATMENT
FACILITY. THE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL
PROTECTION MANDATING FLUSHES
TWICE YEAR FOR SAFETY, BUT THESE DAYS IT IS HAPPENING MORE
LIKE ONCE A WEEK.
&gt;&gt; PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ALREADY ELSE IN AN OPERATION
HAVING NOT HAD THIS INCIDENT.
REPORT WATER AUTHORITY SAYS THE GOAL IS TO A TREATMENT PLANT
BUILT TO FILTER OUT THE MEDAL
BUT THE SITE PLANNED FOR THIS FACILITY MAY HAVE CONNECTION TO
THE WAMPANOAG TRIBE AND HAS TO
PASS INSPECTION FOR NEXT TUESDAY.
&gt;&gt; WE ARE GOING TO STRIP 18
INCHES OF SOIL FROM THE LAND AND WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR IS
ANY TYPE OF SIGNIFICANT
ARTIFACTS. &gt;&gt; IN THE MEANTIME, PEOPLE WHO
LIVE HERE ARE TAKING IT ONE DAY
AT A TIME. &gt;&gt; THE WORST I HAVE EVER SEEN
THE WATER.
IT'S MUD. MUD.

      <description>AVENUE.
&gt;&gt;&gt; METEOROLOGIST SHIRI SPEAR
BACK NOW WITH A CHECK THE FORECAST.
SHIRI, THIS IS THE WEEKEND
WHERE WE WERE GOING TO HAVE TO SET THOSE CLOCKS BACK.
&gt;&gt; WE GET THAT EXTRA HOUR OF SLEEP AND THEN SUN SETS ON
SUNDAY.
&gt;&gt; Daniel:  4:30. &gt;&gt; Shiri:  IT IS FANTASTIC FOR
US BECAUSE WE HAVE TO GO TO BED
EARLY. MOST OF YOU YOU ARE ROLLING
YOUR EYES, OH, MY GOSH, I FEEL
LIKE A VAMPIRE THIS TIME OF YEAR.
ON SUNDAY THE SUN WILL COME UP
AT 6:34 AND DOWN AT 6:41. TODAY ALL AN HOUR LATER SO THE
SUN IS NOT UP THIS MORNING
UNTIL 7:20 A.M. WE DO HAVE A FRONT THAT WILL
SHIFT ACROSS THE AREA, AND AS
IT DOES, IT WILL START SOME CLOUDS.
I DON'T EXPECT ANY RAIN OR
FLURRIES OUT OF THIS ONE, BUT JUST STRICTLY A PERIOD OF
CLOUDS THIS MORNING BACK BEHIND
IT. IT WILL BE BREEZY AND COOL.
AND HERE ARE SOME OF THE CLOUDS
AT 10:00 THIS MORNING, AND WE WILL SEE A PARTLY CLOUDY START
OF THE DAY.
I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE OVERCAST.
WE CLEAR OUT NICELY IN THE
AFTERNOON. AND WE DO HAVE WINDS GUST BEING
20 TO 30 MILES PER HOUR.
SO KEEP IN MIND, IT IS GOING TO BE BREEZY.
I GOT 54 IN BOSTON TODAY AS
WELL AS BEDFORD UP TO LOWELL AND 52, NASHUA UP TO
MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE.
NORTH AND WEST OF BOSTON, IT IS COOLING DOWN.
COUPLE OF SPOTS LIKE KEENE AND
40s FOR YOUR HIGHS AND ALL THE WAY TO 58 IN BRIDGEWATER.
6 IN BROCKTON AS WELL AS
PLYMOUTH AND MID-50s OVER THE CAPE, THE ISLANDS TODAY.
HOW ABOUT 58 DEGREES ON THE
VINEYARD. AND I THINK YOU BETTER LIKE IT
WHILE YOU CAN, BECAUSE IT GETS
A LITTLE COOLER FROM HERE. TOMORROW MORNING WE JUMPED
AHEAD HERE TO 8:30 TOMORROW
MORNING. I WANT TO POINT OUT YOU WILL
SEE A LITTLE BIT OF GREEN AND A
LITTLE BIT OF PURPLE ON THE MAP PAUSE THERE IS A RISK FOR A
QUICK PASSING TEMPERATURE IN
AND A LITTLE DRIZZLE. NOTHING WIDESPREAD.
 VERY, VERY SPOTTY AND NO
IMPACT ON YOUR WEEKEND PLANS. AS WE TRAVEL THROUGH THE DAY,
SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND THAT
VERY SLIGHT RISK. ON AND OFF CLOUDS FOR YOUR
SATURDAY.
WE HAVE A SERIES OF DISTURBANCES COMING THROUGH
THAT ARE STIRRING UP THE CLOUDS
AND HOLDING IN THE COLD. ON SUNDAY, THOUGH, WHAT I THINK
WE WILL HAVE TO WATCH ARE SOME
ONSHORE WIND. IF THAT HAPPENS IT WILL NULL
ENOUGH MOISTURE TO PULL IN
CLOUD AT THE COASTLINE. ONE TO ARE TWO SPRINKLES.
AND FURTHER WEST THE BRIGHTER
ON SUNDAY. ANOTHER PARTLY CLOUDY DAY.
A HIGH TOMORROW 52 IN BOSTON.
48 IN WORCESTER. 49 IN CONCORD, NEW HAMPSHIRE.
52 IN HYANNIS.
BOTH DAYS ON THE CAPE RUN INTO THE 50s.
THE TEMPERATURES DIP BACK UPPER
40s IN BOSTON, WORCESTER AND CONCORD, NEW HAMPSHIRE AND
OBVIOUSLY IT IS GOING DOWN AS
WE TRAVEL THROUGH THE WEEKEND. 56 TODAY WITH INCREASING SUN.
PARTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS BOTH
DAYS OVER THE WEEKEND. LOOK AT THOSE MORNING
TEMPERATURES 20s AND 30s.
YIKES. STARTING TO FEEL CHILLY.
54 DEGREES NEXT MONDAY WITH
SUNSHINE. TUESDAY, KEEPING THINGS CLEAR.
TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY WE
DO HAVE OUR NEXT CHANCE OF SHOWERS LOOKING VERY WEAK AT
THIS POINT.
BACK TO YOU.</description>

      <description>THIS POOR LITTLE CREATURE, WHO
REMAINS NAMELESS RIGHT NOW, WAS
ABANDONED BY HIS MOM AS SOON AS HE WAS BORN.
THEY SAID THE MOM LOOKED LIKE
SHE WAS SCARED OF IT, ACTING LIKE IT WAS A STRANGER.
SO THESE FOUR MEN ARE PLAYING
NANNY TO THIS LITTLE BABY. IT IS NOW 6 MONTHS OLD.
HERE'S THE BABY WITH DADDY.
THEY THINK HE'S THE FAVORITE. AND THESE MEN HAVE VOLUNTEERED
TO WATCH THIS CHIMP AROUND THE
CLOCK. &gt;&gt; ALL THE MAKINGS OF AN '80s
COMEDY.
&gt;&gt; I SWEAR I SAW THIS SHOW IN LIKE 1988.
&gt;&gt; SIX MONTHS FROM NOW WHEN THE
CHIMP IS A YEAR OLD, THEY ARE ABLE TO PUT IT IN ITS OWN
ENCLOSURE AND IT CAN BE LIKE THE
OTHER CHIMPANZEES. &gt;&gt; WHAT A GREAT JOB TO HAVE.
YOU'RE GOING TO GET TO HANG OUT
WITH A CHIMP DAY IN AND DAY OUT. &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
YOU HAVE THAT JOB.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S TRUE, BUT IT'S A LOT LESS FUN THAN THIS.
&gt;&gt; WE'RE CUTE.
&gt;&gt; WHAT GETS TO ME IS HOW CLOSE THE CHIMP IS TO ITS HUMAN DAD.
TRYING TO STEAL SOME KISSES FROM
DADDY. &gt;&gt; AW, THAT'S SO CUTE.
DUDE, YOU TAKE A CHIMP OUT IN
PUBLIC, TOTAL CHICK MAGNET.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt; CHIMP MAGNET.
&gt;&gt;&gt; WHEN I WAS A KID, MY MOM
USED TO TELL ME THAT TWO WRONGS DON'T MAKE A RIGHT.
WELL, THIS DAD IN TAIWAN DIDN'T
GET THAT MESSAGE FROM MY MAMA. YOU SAW THAT WHITE CAR.
IT'S CRASHED UP PRETTY BADLY.
BUT HERE COMES THE BMW. &gt;&gt; OH, OH, OH!
&gt;&gt; OKAY.
&gt;&gt; I THINK SOMEONE'S MAD. &gt;&gt; JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT,
DID THE WHITE CAR REAR END THE
BMW, OR THE BMW IS THE AGGRESSOR IN ALL OF THIS?
&gt;&gt; THE PERSON IN THE WHITE CAR
REAR ENDED THE PEOPLE IN THE BLACK CAR.
IT WAS A DAD, HIS WIFE, AND
5-YEAR-OLD SON. HE'S MAD.
&gt;&gt; HIS 5-YEAR-OLD SON IS STILL
IN THE CAR? &gt;&gt; NO, THEY BOTH GOT OUT OF THE
CAR.
THE DAD TOOK IT UPON HIMSELF TO GET REVENGE.
&gt;&gt; WHAT'S THE REVENGE?
THE DAMAGE IS ALREADY DONE. NOW YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO
SCREW YOURSELF OUT OF ANY KIND
OF INSURANCE MONEY. YOU JUST TURNED THIS INTO
CRIMINAL ACTIVITY.
&gt;&gt; THE WHITE CAR REAR ENDED YOU. &gt;&gt; THE DRIVER OF THE WHITE CAR
AND HIS BOYS GOT OUT WITH BATS.
AS THE VIDEO CUTS AND SWITCHES ANGLES, WE DON'T SEE THEM, BUT
WE DO SEE THE BLACK CAR NOW TURN
AROUND AND START SMASHING INTO THE WHITE CAR HEAD ON.
SO WORD IS THE FOLKS IN THE
WHITE CAR TOOK OFF AND RAN INTO A RESTAURANT.
HERE YOU SEE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE
STREETS APPROACHING THE CAR. I CAN IMAGINE IT'S LIKE, HEY,
DUDE, CALM DOWN.
WHEN THE COPS GOT THERE, THEY MADE SOME ARRESTS.
BOTH PARTIES WERE FINED.
THE DAD STOOD BY HIS DECISION TO CRASH INTO THIS CAR, SAYING THE
DRIVER OF THE WHITE CAR PUT HIS
FAMILY IN DANGER. I PERSONALLY DON'T AGREE.
BUT PEOPLE ONLINE AND IN THE
AREA ARE SUPPORTING HIS DECISION.
&gt;&gt; NO, THIS IS THE DEFINITION OF
ROAD RAGE. NO.
THAT'S NOT JUSTIFY.
LET IT BE. &gt;&gt; IT'S A TEACHABLE MOMENT THAT
HE'S GLORIOUSLY FAILED IN AS AN
EXAMPLE TO HIS CHILD.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; SOMETIMES YOU JUST HAVE TO
THROW CAUTION TO THE WIND AND
REALLY JUST GO OUT AND LIVE THE DREAMS YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO.
&gt;&gt; THE MISSION IS TO TRAVEL THE
LENGTH OF THE AMERICAS BY NONMOTORIZED MEANS, GATHERING
STORIES ALONG THE WAY, INSPIRING
OTHERS TO PURSUE THEIR OWN DREAMS.
&gt;&gt; THEY WENT ON AN ODYSSEY
CALLED HER ODYSSEY. THEY RECORDED ALL OF IT TO
CREATE SEASON ONE, IF YOU WILL,
OF THEIR ADVENTURE. THEY'RE DOCUMENTING THEIR
EXPERIENCES, THEIR EXCHANGES
WITH THE LOCAL PEOPLE, WHAT THEY'RE LEARNING, BUT ALSO
CREATING CONVERSATION ABOUT
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IN LIFE. &gt;&gt; WHEN SIGIT FIRST BEGAN
DREAMING OF THIS TREK, SHE HAD
IN MIND THE GROWING MOVEMENT OF WOMEN ACROSS THE WORLD STANDING
UP AND STEPPING FORWARD.
FROM PROMOTING PEACE WORK AND SOCIAL CHANGE, ENRICHING
WORKPLACE AND PERSONAL LIFE, TO
ADVANCES IN ART, AGRICULTURE, SCIENCES.
THE LIST GOES ON.
&gt;&gt; THEY'RE ALSO USING THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO EMPOWER WOMEN TO
ALSO GET OUT THERE AND LIVE.
&gt;&gt; THAT IS QUITE AN ADVENTURE THEY'RE TAKING.
A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD BE AFRAID
TO DO THAT. GOOD FOR THEM.
&gt;&gt; IN SEASON ONE OF THEIR
ADVENTURE, THEY COVERED 1500 MILES IN 144 DAYS.
BUT HERE'S THE THING.
THEY NOW WANT TO TRAVEL THE AMERICAS.
WE'RE TALKING NOW 20,000 MILES
IN ONE YEAR FOR SEASON TWO OF THEIR JOURNEY.
&gt;&gt; THEY'LL HAVE TO WALK A BIT
QUICKER. &gt;&gt; SLIGHTLY.
&gt;&gt; YOU DON'T WANT TO RUSH
SOMETHING LIKE THIS. THE WHOLE POINT IS SLOWING DOWN
AND EXPERIENCE HUMANITY AND
EXPERIENCING WHAT MAKES US ALL DIFFERENT BUT THE SAME.
THE SAME THINGS WE ALL WANT, THE
HAPPINESS, THE LOVE, THE ADVENTURE.
THAT'S WHAT TRAVEL CAN DO TO
YOU. THAT'S HOW IT OPENS UP YOUR
MIND.
HOPEFULLY THAT PEOPLE WILL WATCH THIS WILL GET THAT.
&gt;&gt; THEY ALSO SET UP A GO FUND ME
PAGE WHERE THEY'RE RAISING FUNDS NOT ONLY TO ASSIST IN THEIR
JOURNEY, BUT THEY KNOW IF THEY
HAVE THIS MONEY, THEY CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE LOCAL
ECONOMIES AS THEY GO THROUGH.
IF YOU WANT TO FOLLOW ALONG IN THEIR JOURNEY OR CONTRIBUTE TO

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; YOU'RE A MERE SPECK AFLOAT
OUT IN THE OCEAN ON A BOAT, AND
YOU'RE NOT FEELING WELL. YOU'VE GOT A MEDICAL EMERGENCY
GOING ON, ON THIS FISHING BOAT
OFF THE COAST OF VANCOUVER ISLAND.
NOW, THERE'S NO HOSPITAL ON
BOARD. THERE'S NO AMBULANCE YOU CAN
CALL.
SO THE CANADIAN SEARCH AND RESCUE TEAMS HAVE TO COME OUT
AND HELP YOU OUT.
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THIS FISHING BOAT, IT'S LIKE A GIANT FLOATING
PORCUPINE.
HOW HARD IS IT GOING TO BE TO GET CLOSE TO THIS BOAT?
GOOD THING IS THE CANADIAN
SEARCH AND RESCUE TEAM HAVE TRAINED FOR THIS.
THEY'VE ALREADY LANDED ONE
RESCUE DIVER ON BOARD. ANOTHER ONE IS GOING TO GO DOWN
AND MEET HIM.
THEY'RE GOING TO PACKAGE UP THE SICK FELLA AND HOIST HIM BACK UP
TO THE HELICOPTER.
&gt;&gt; I'M GLAD YOU SAID THEY TRAINED FOR THIS.
IT WOULD HAVE SUCKED IF THEY GOT
THERE AND WERE LIKE, LARRY, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO NOW?
&gt;&gt; THAT MAN WAS TRANSPORTED TO
THE HOSPITAL. THAT RESCUE QUITE HEROIC, BUT WE
MOVE TO TURKEY, WHERE THIS
RESCUE IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT. WE HAVE A MAN WORKING WITH A
CEMENT TRUCK WHO THOUGHT IT
WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO STICK HIS HEAD INSIDE THE CEMENT
TRUCK.
&gt;&gt; NO. &gt;&gt; BAD IDEA.
&gt;&gt; NOW HE'S STUCK BY THE HEAD.
YOU CAN HEAR THE WAILS COMING FROM THIS GUY.
HE'S BARELY GOT ANY FOOTING.
HIS RIGHT FOOT JUST HOLDING THE REST OF HIS BODY UP.
NOW EVERYBODY STARTS TO SPRING
INTO ACTION TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO FREE THIS GUY.
&gt;&gt; SO THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY
CONCRETE PLANS? &gt;&gt; NOT YET, NO.
THE FIRST THING THEY TRY IS A
POLE. THEY'RE GOING TO WEDGE OPEN
WHATEVER HE'S STUCK IN.
THAT DIDN'T WORK. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T SAY.
&gt;&gt; NOW THE NEXT THING THEY'RE
GOING TO TRY, AN ANGLE GRINDER. THAT DOESN'T WORK.
EVENTUALLY FIREFIGHTERS SHOW UP
AND THEY START WORKING WITH THEIR OWN HEAVY EQUIPMENT.
THE MAN IS FREED.
HE, TOO, WAS TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL WITH NONLIFE
THREATENING INJURIES, BUT HE DID
HAVE TO HAVE SURGERY FOR SOME</description>

      <description>DOWNLOAD IT NOW.
&gt;&gt;&gt; IF I JUST DO THIS, I'M NOT
GOING TO SPONTANEOUSLY FALL OVER.
SO WHY IS IT DIFFERENT IF YOU
CHANGE HOW HIGH YOU'RE STANDING? GUY HERE HAS CLIMBED TO THE TOP
OF THIS BUILDING.
FOUND HIMSELF A LADDER AND HE'S GOING UP A FEW MORE LEVELS
BECAUSE HE JUST WANTS TO GET A
NICER VIEW OF THE CITY HE'S IN. &gt;&gt; OKAY.
&gt;&gt; BOINK, BOINK.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S PRETTY HIGH. &gt;&gt; IT'S STRAIGHT DOWN.
ANY TIME I LOOK AT THESE GUYS, I
THINK, HOW DO YOU NOT FALL? YOU DON'T JUST SPONTANEOUSLY
DUMP OVER.
WHY IS THIS SO MUCH SCARIER? I GUESS IT'S JUST THAT INNATE
FEAR OF HEIGHTS.
&gt;&gt; BUT THERE'S NO RAIL TO KEEP HIM FROM FALLING.
IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S RIGHT ON THE
EDGE. &gt;&gt; WE DON'T USE RAILINGS WHEN
WE'RE JUST STANDING HERE.
DO YOU FIND THAT INTERESTING? I DO.
HE FINDS A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF
THE BUILDING AND GETS HIMSELF ANOTHER VIEW.
I LOVE HIS WHOLE NONCHALANT LAID
BACK ATTITUDE OF THIS WHOLE EXCURSION.
BACK DOWN THE STAIRS HE GOES AND
JUST STROLLS RIGHT OUT THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING LIKE NOTHING
HAPPENED.
HE GIVES US A GROUND'S EYE VIEW OF HIS BIRD'S EYE VIEW.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S AMAZING.
I LOVE THAT THESE GUYS CAN DO</description>

      <description>THAT.
&gt;&gt;&gt; WE ALL KNOW THE MOST
ANNOYING THING THAT CAN HAPPEN TO YOU IN A CAR IS BACKSEAT
DRIVING.
SEEING AS SHE'S NOT HERE RIGHT NOW, MY MUM.
SHE'S THE WORST.
IN FACT, MOST MOTHERS, I THINK, ARE THE WORST BACKSEAT DRIVERS.
TURNS OUT THERE'S ONE
COMBINATION THAT'S WORSE. INSTEAD OF USING GOOGLE MAPS, WE
GOT GOOGLE GRANNIES.
THEY DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE EVER.
&gt;&gt; NOW LET'S GO DOWN HERE AND
TURN AROUND. &gt;&gt; YOUR GRANDMOTHER DOESN'T KNOW
WHERE IN THE HELL SHE'S GOING
EITHER. &gt;&gt; NO, SHUT YOUR MOUTH.
&gt;&gt; YEAH, [ BLEEP ].
&gt;&gt; THAT'S HOW IT STARTS. FROM THAT POINT ON, IT JUST GETS
HILARIOUS.
&gt;&gt; SO DO I GO RIGHT? &gt;&gt; YES.
GO UP THE HILL.
&gt;&gt; THEN LEFT UP HERE. &gt;&gt; THEN YOU TURN TO YOUR RIGHT
WAY UP THERE.
&gt;&gt; LEFT, LEFT. &gt;&gt; WAIT, WHICH IS IT, LEFT OR
RIGHT?
&gt;&gt; LEFT, LEFT. &gt;&gt; YOU GO RIGHT.
LIKE SHE TOLD YOU, YOU'LL COME
TO A DEAD END. &gt;&gt; HOW SHE HASN'T CRUSHED THE
CAR AT THIS POINT, I DON'T KNOW.
&gt;&gt; WHERE THE HELL ARE WE GOING? [ BLEEP ].
&gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE HAVING TWO
BICKERING KIDS MULTIPLIED BY 100, ADDING SWEAR WORDS.
&gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T TELL THEM TO HUSH
IT OR THREATEN THEM WITH A SPANKING.
SO YOU JUST GOT TO TAKE IT AND
DRIVE. &gt;&gt; BE CAREFUL HERE.
&gt;&gt; OKAY.
THIS IS WHERE MARY KAY HAD HER ACCIDENT, RIGHT?
&gt;&gt; YEAH, THAT'S WHERE SHE HAD
HER WRECK. &gt;&gt; [ BLEEP ].
&gt;&gt; THAT IS THE BEST PART.
SHE'S IN THE BACKGROUND. SHE'S TALKING AND NOBODY REALLY
IS LISTENING.
&gt;&gt; THESE REAL PAIN IN THE -- &gt;&gt; SO WE HAVE TO GET ON THE
EXPRESSWAY GOING THE OTHER
DIRECTION. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
&gt;&gt; YOU ACTUALLY GO TO THEIR
YOUTUBE CHANNEL, WHO I SUBSCRIBE TO, THERE'S PART TWO, PART
THREE, AND PART FOUR OF THIS
SAME CAR JOURNEY. IF YOU WANT TO ENJOY IT, WE'LL
PUT ALL OF THIS UP ON OUR
WEBSITE, RIGHTTHISMINUTE.COM.</description>

      <description>NOW BACK TO THE SHOW.
&gt;&gt; IT IS HARD NOT TO FEEL FOR
THIS 90-YEAR-OLD MAN. HE IS LIVING IN A PARK IN
TURKEY.
HE IS THE VICTIM OF URBAN RENEWAL.
THEY DEMOLISHED HIS HOUSE SO
THEY COULD BUILD SOMETHING MORE MODERN.
INSTEAD OF FINDING A NEW PLACE,
THIS MAN MOVED HIMSELF, HIS MATTRESS, SOME BLANKETS AND HIS
THINGS INTO A PARK.
IF YOU LOOK AT HIM CLOSELY, YOU CAN SEE THAT HIS HANDS ARE
DEFORMED.
AND PEOPLE IN THIS AREA BECAME WORRIED ABOUT HIM BECAUSE IT'S
STARTING TO GET COLD, AND THIS
MAN IS LIVING IN A PARK. &gt;&gt; THAT IS SO HORRIBLE THAT
SOMEONE WOULD ACTUALLY KICK A
HUMAN BEING OUT OF THEIR HOME. &gt;&gt; WELL, THE CITY MAYOR REALLY
GOT CONCERNED ABOUT THIS AFTER
HEARING FROM RESIDENTS IN THE AREA.
SO HE ASKED LOCAL CHARITIES AND
SOCIAL WORKERS TO GO DOWN AND INTERVENE.
THEY DID.
THEY WERE ABLE TO PUT HIM IN A NURSING HOME, AND THAT'S WHEN
THEY FOUND OUT SOMETHING VERY
INTERESTING ABOUT HIM. THEY STARTED LOOKING INTO HIS
PERSONAL AFFAIRS AND THEY
DISCOVERED HE WAS SITTING ON A LITTLE NEST EGG OF ABOUT
$29,000.
&gt;&gt; NO WAY. &gt;&gt; YES.
THEY FOUND IT IN A BANK ACCOUNT
AND SAID, WHY ARE YOU LIVING ON THE STREET?
HE GOES, WELL, YOU SEE, I ALWAYS
WANTED TO GET MARRIED SO I WAS SAVING MONEY TOP GET MARRIED AND
THE MONEY JUST KEPT COMPOUNDING
INTEREST. &gt;&gt; I MEAN, HE KNEW HE HAD AN
ACCOUNT.
BUT DID HE KNOW WHAT HAD ACCUMULATED?
&gt;&gt; HE KNEW THERE WAS QUITE A BIT
OF MONEY IN THERE, BUT HE SAID HE GOT SO USED TO SAVING AND
WAITING FOR THAT RIGHT LADY TO
COME ALONG, HE GOT USED TO NOT TOUCHING IT.
&gt;&gt; SOME PEOPLE HAVE THE IDEA OF
A DREAM WEDDING. I GUESS HE'S NOT READY TO LET GO
OF THAT DREAM.</description>

SPORT INTO THIS ONE COMPLEX. THEY'VE GOT BASKETBALL, GOLF,
GYMNASTICS, EVERYTHING, BOWLING,
HOCKEY. &gt;&gt; WOW.
&gt;&gt; IT'S JUST ONE BIG PLAYGROUND.
&gt;&gt; SOCCER. &gt;&gt; YOU'D NEVER CALL IN SICK,
EVER.
&gt;&gt; WHY WOULD YOU? &gt;&gt; YEAH.
&gt;&gt; NO, YOU CALL IN INJURED.
&gt;&gt; THEY HAVE RC RACING. THEY ALSO HAVE THE GO KARTS THEY
DRIVE AROUND IN AND HAVE RACES
IN. &gt;&gt; THEY'VE EVEN GOT THE GOLF
SIMULATOR UPSTAIRS.
COME ON. &gt;&gt; ALL CREDIT TO THESE GUYS.
THEY WORKED VERY HARD.
THEY HAVE BEEN AT THIS TRICK SHOP STUFF FOR YEARS.
THEY'VE WORKED UP THEIR
SUBSCRIBERS. SO THEY'VE EARNED IT, MAN.
GOOD FOR THEM.
&gt;&gt; WORK HARD, PLAY HARD. &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS THEIR JOB.
THAT'S THE THING.
THEIR JOB IS TO PLAY. &gt;&gt; IF YOU LOVE WHAT YOU DO,
YOU'RE NOT WORKING.
THESE GUYS AREN'T WORKING.</description>

      <description>YOU MESS HER BED UP?
I THINK HE DID.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD BE IN THE MOVIES OR SOMETHING.
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE,
NICK? &gt;&gt; I'M IN THE MOOD FOR EAR
PLUGS.
IT'S ABOUT TO GET ALL ROMANTICAL.
OH, IT'S A WEDDING.
&gt;&gt; THE TRADITIONAL RITE OF PASSAGE, THE WHOLE CUTTING OF
THE CAKE.
THEY CUT THEMSELVES OFF A NICE BIG SLICE.
THEY BRING IT APART.
THEY FEED EACH OTHER THE CAKE. SO SWEET.
THOUGH THERE MAY BE SOME PEOPLE
AT HOME THAT ARE GOING, I KNOW THAT GUY'S FACE.
WELL, THAT'S BLAKE.
BLAKE MADE IT THROUGH THE SEMIFINALS OF "AMERICA'S GOT
TALENT" SEASON 11 BECAUSE HE'S A
BIT OF A MAGICIAN. IT'S ABOUT TO GET A BIT MORE
MAGICAL.
&gt;&gt; THE MAIN QUESTION THAT MOST PEOPLE ASK US WHEN WE GOT
MARRIED WAS IS THERE GOING TO BE
ANY MAGIC AT THE WEDDING. &gt;&gt; YEAH, YEAH.
IS THERE GOING TO BE ANY MAGIC?
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE LOVE AND ALL THAT STUFF.
THEY'RE TALKING MAGIC.
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE A MAGICIAN. IT GOES HAND IN HAND.
&gt;&gt; NO, THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE
ANY MAGIC. BUT IT'S GOING TO BE MAGICAL.
&gt;&gt; SEE, THERE YOU GO.
THERE'S THE SWEET ANSWER. THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE ANY
MAGIC, BUT IT'S GOING TO BE A
MAGICAL TIME. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHEN I TURN TO MY
WIFE.
LET'S GO. IT'S GOING TO BE BORING.
&gt;&gt; BEFORE YOU LEAVE, TURNS OUT
THE MAGICIAN REALLY CAN'T HELP HIMSELF.
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU THINKING WHAT I'M
THINKING? &gt;&gt; WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
PRETTY MUCH TAKES THE CAKE.
&gt;&gt; HOW'D THEY DO THAT? HOW'D THAT HAPPEN?
&gt;&gt; IT MUST HAVE BEEN ONE SLICE
POSITIONED IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND EVERYTHING ELSE WAS FAKE.
&gt;&gt; THERE'S CAKE COMING OUT.
DON'T WORRY, EVERYBODY.</description>

OFFICERS WERE FOUND WHEN POLICE
WERE CALLED TO THE SCENE ON REPORT OF SHOTS FIRED AND FOUND

CARS.
BOTH OF THEM WERE IN THE CARS. &gt;&gt; THERE'S CLEARLY DANGER RIGHT

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; ALL THE WAY AND GET TO THE
CITY PRETTY MUCH, ROUTE 1
SOUTHBOUND NEAR CARTER STREET AND CHELSEA, STILL ON THE MAP AS
WELL, YOU'RE JAMMED UP ON
ROUTE 1 IN SAUGUS. 128 USUAL SLOW RIDE AND THIS IS
POPPING UP, EXPRESSWAY
SOUTHBOUND ONE LANE BLOCKED AT FREEPORT STREET AND SEE THE
EXPRESSWAY JAMMED UP IN THE
USUAL STRETCH AS YOU GO THROUGH QUINCY ALL THE WAY INTO THE
CITY.
LET'S TAKE LOOK AT EXPRESSWAY RIGHT NOW, AND YOU COULD SEE THE
DELAY, HEAVY JAM THERE AS YOU
TRY TO MAKE WAY INTO THE CITY. IN THAT SAME FREEPORT STREET
AREA, YOU DON'T SEE THE LANE
BLOCKAGE ON CAMERA AND TOO MANY DELAYS BECAUSE OF IT BUT
CONTINUE MONITORING THE SPOT FOR
YOU AND LOOK AT DRIVE TIMES, ROUTE 24, 15 MINUTES TO THE PIKE
46 MINUTES, 93 FROM 495 TO THE
LEVERETT CONNECTOR AND JUST ABOUT AN HOUR RIGHT NOW.
SHIRI, MAYBE NOT FULL SUNSHINE
TODAY BUT CERTAINLY A LITTLE WARM-UP WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD
TO.
&gt;&gt; THINGS WILL WARM UP, EVEN THE WAY WE ARE STARTING HERE AND
WHEN WE START AT 52Â°, AS OPPOSED
TO 20s AND 30s AND WINDS UNDER 10 MILES PER HOUR, WE ARE
NOT EVEN BOTHERING WITH ANY KIND
OF WIND CHILLS RIGHT NOW AND HAVE MOSTLY CLOUDY 62IZ THROUGH
THE REST OF THE MORNING COMMUTE.
55Â° 9:00 A.M. IN BOSTON AND WE HEAD INTO THE MID AND UPPER
60s TOMORROW AFTERNOON AND
NOTICE RIGHT THERE AND COMES WITH SLIGHTLY WARM MOISTURE AND
CLOUDS EASILY DEVELOPING TODAY
AND HERE YOU HAVE IT AT NOON TIME, LOOKS A LITTLE BRIGHTER
INTO THE AFTERNOON, CLOUDS KIND
OF COME BACK INTO PLAY AND NORTH AND WEST OF BOSTON AND CENTRAL
NEW HAMPSHIRE AND NORTHERN
MASSACHUSETTS. 66 IN BOSTON IN LAWRENCE, OVER
TO LOWELL TODAY, GOT 66 IN
WESTBORO, LOWER 60s IN WORCESTER TO 65 IN NASHUA AND
MANCHESTER.
WE GOT TEMPERATURES THAT ARE GOING TO HOVER RIGHT AROUND THE
MIDDLE 60s FROM BRIDGEWATER
AND STILL IN PLYMOUTH, SEE A LITTLE BIT BRIGHTER FOR YOU
FOLKS THIS AFTERNOON AND OVER
THE CAPE AND ISLANDS WE GOT LOW AND MID-60s AND WE GOT MOSTLY
SUNNY SKIES.
NOW, FOR THE DAY TOMORROW, I KNOW WE LOVE THE TEMPERATURES,
GOT SOME MORE 60s, EVEN 70
DEGREE READING EXPECTED IN PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND, BUT WE
GOT RAIN.
GOING TO AFFECT AREAS NORTH AND WEST FIRST, A LOT OF YOUR DAY IN
SOUTHEASTERN MASS ENDS UP
RUNNING DRY BUT BREAK WHEN TO EXPECT THE SHOWERS AND FUTURE
CAST JUST UPDATED, BRAND-NEW,
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME SHOWING IT ON AIR, 7:00 A.M. I STILL GOT
DRIZZLE EXPECTED ACROSS NORTHERN
MASS AND SOUTHERN NEW HAMPSHIRE AS HEAD TOWARD NOON TIME AND
SOUTHEASTERN MASS LOOKING DRY
AND SPEEDING UP SLIGHTLY 3:00 P.M. AND ALREADY RAIN IN
BOSTON, BEFORE THAT JUST BACK
INTO WORCESTER, SO THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF AN EARLIER
TIMELINE AND SHOWERS AROUND FOR
THE EVENING COMMUTE AND STILL SEEING THE SAME EFFECTS HERE, A
LITTLE FASTER TO TAPER ON OF FOR
THURSDAY NIGHT. WEDNESDAY TODAY 67Â°, GOING TO BE
WARMER AND 65 HERE TOMORROW WITH
DEVELOPING RAIN FOR THE AFTERNOON, WRAPPING UP IN THE
COOL AND BREEZY FRIDAY ABOUT
53Â°, TRACKING SOME WINDS GUSTING 20 TO 30 MILES PER HOUR.
WEEKEND GOT HIGHS IN THE LOWER
50s BOTH DAYS, SLIGHT RISK FOR FLURRY OR EVEN A SPRINKLE HERE
ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND WE GOT
THE SLIGHT RISK HERE ON SUNDAY. I KNOW IT IS NOT EXACTLY AN
AWARD-WINNING WEEKEND BUT
TEMPERATURES A LITTLE BIT BELOW AVERAGE.
MOST OF THE TIME I WOULD SAY
ABOUT 80, 90% OF THE TIME, DON'T WANT YOU TO BE SHOCKED BY THE
FLURRIES, TEMPERATURES KIND OF
COOL INTO NEXT WEEK AS WELL AND DRY AND BRIGHT MONDAY AND
TUESDAY.
BACK TO YOU. &gt;&gt; Gene: NATION'S LEADING

      <description>MILLER, FOX25 NEWS.
&gt;&gt;&gt; CLEANUP CREWS ARE HEADED TO
WESTFORD TO GET A TRAIN BACK ON THE TRACKS.
&gt;&gt; TAKE A LIVE LOOK IN WESTFORD
WHERE SIX CARS WENT OFF OUR THE TRACKS.
IT IS VERY CLOSE TO THE SPOT
WHERE A TRAIN WENT OFF THE TRACKS JUST TWO YEARS AGO.
FOX25'S MICHAEL HENRICH LIVE IN
WESTFORD THIS MORNING AND MICHAEL, SINCE YOUR LAST REPORT
AT THE TOP OF THE HOUR, YOU
HAVE SPOKEN TO A TOWN OFFICIAL. WHAT IS THE LATEST ON THE
CLEANUP EFFORT THERE?
PAN AM RAILWAYS IS IN CHARGE OF GETTING THE TRAIN CARS BACK ON
THE TRACK.
SHOW WHERE YOU IT STANDS RIGHT NOW.
PRETTY MUCH HOW THIS LOOKED
AROUND 8:00 WHEN THE SIX TRAIN CARS WENT OFF THE RAILS RIGHT
BY BROADWAY AND RIVER STREETS
HERE IN WESTFORD. THIS TOWN SELECTMAN SAID HE WAS
ACTUALLY AT THE TOWN SELECTMAN
BOARD MEETING WHEN THEY ALL GOT THE CALL THAT THIS HAS TAKEN
PLACE.
CON TARRY TO WHAT WE LEARNED EARLIER, HIS FAMILY THAT LIVES
NEARBY, THEY LIVE A COUPLE
BLOCKS AWAY, DID GET A REVERSE 911 CALL TO PUT THEM ON NOTICE
THAT THEY SPOTLIGHT TO
EVACUATE. IT WAS INITIALLY CALLED OUT AS
A TIER 1 HAZMAT SITUATION WHICH
IS THE LOWEST LEVEL OF HAZMAT SITUATION.
THEN THEY DID DISCOVER THAT NO
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS HAD BEEN SPILLED PUTTING SOME NEIGHBORS
AT EASE.
WITH ALL THIS SAID, THIS TOWN SELECTMAN SAID HE IS VERY
CONCERNED BECAUSE TWO AND A
HALF YEARS AGO ANOTHER TRAIN BY PAN AM RAILWAYS DERAILED NEAR
THIS SPOT AND THAT MEANS TO
HIM, THERE IS AN ONGOING PROBLEM.
HE WANTS THIS INVESTIGATION TO
BE AS TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE. HE SAYS HIS OWN FAMILY AND HIS
NEIGHBORS AND CONSTITUENTS WANT
TO KNOW HOW PAN AM WILL PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN.
I REACHED OUT TO THE RAILWAY
COMPANY AND WE WILL STAY ON THIS THROUGHOUT THE MORNING.
LIVE IN WESTFORD, HIN HEN,

WHO WAS ROBBED AT GUNPOINT SATURDAY NIGHT AT THE WILLOW
TREE MARKET IN HYANNIS.
THE INCIDENT WAS CAUGHT ON SURVEILLANCE VIDEO.
YOU CAN SEE THE MAN FIRE HIS
GUN WHEN THE WORKER WOULDN'T GIVE HIM MONEY.
THE EMPLOYEE TOLD US HE WASN'T
SCARED AT FIRST BECAUSE HE DIDN'T THINK THE GUN WAS REAL.
&gt;&gt; I LAUGHED AT HIM LIKE THE
HALLOWEEN KIND OF THING. I THOUGHT HE WAS TRUING JUST
TRYING TO STEAL -- JUST TRYING
TO SCARE ME. OPEN THE REGISTER.
GIVE ME WHATEVER ENOUGH THERE.

&gt;&gt;&gt; THIS MORNING INVESTIGATORS
INVESTIGATOR WILL WORK TO TRY TO DETERMINE WHY A TRAIN WENT
OFF THE TRACKS IN WESTWOOD.
&gt;&gt; Gene:  CREWS TRY TO DETERMINE IF ANY OF THE
CHEMICALS LEAKED FROM THE CARS.
MICHAEL HENRICH IS LIVE AT THE SCENE WHERE WE ARE AWAITING FOR
INVESTIGATORS FROM PAN AM TO
ARRIVE. MICHAEL, GOOD MORNING.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: GOOD MORNING, PAN
AM RAILWAYS IS IN CHARGE OF THIS INVESTIGATION AS WE
UNDERSTAND IT AND AT THIS
POINT, THEY DON'T BELIEVE THAT ANYTHING SPILLED.
BUT THE TRAIN CARS THAT GOT OFF
THE TRACKS AND DERAILED ARE STILL HERE AND NOT IN A
POSITION TO BE REMOVED JUST
YET. THEY HAVE A GENERATOR WITH
SPOTLIGHTS LIGHTING UP THE
SCENE AND HANDFUL OF PEOPLE IN YELLOW REFLECTIVE GEAR WALKING
BACK AND FORTH AND IT WILL BE
DAYLIGHT BEFORE ACTUALLY REMOVING ANY OF THESE CARS.
NOW I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOME
PICTURES TAKEN BY SOME OF OUR VIEWERS WHO LIVE NEARBY
SNAPPING THESE PHOTOS RIGHT
AFTER THIS HAPPENED AT 8:30 NEAR BROADWAY AND RIVER STREET
IN THAT AREA OF WESTFORD.
NOW INITIALLY IT WAS CALLED OUT AS A TIER ONE HAZMAT SITUATION.
THIS IS THE WILL HEEST LEVEL OF
CONCERN WHEN IT COMES TO THAT HAZMAT SCALING SYSTEM, AND,
AGAIN, THEY DO NOT BELIEVE
ANYTHING SPILLED OUT SO THEY CALLED OFF THE INITIAL PLAN OR
THOUGHT PROCESS OF DOING A
REVERSE 911 CALL TO NEARBY RESIDENTS.
AGAIN, THAT NEVER MATERIALIZED.
A MEMBER OF THE TOWN BOARD OF SELECTMEN JUST DID SHOW UP ON
SCENE.
AND BEFORE I WENT ON AIR ABOUT 30 SECONDS BEFORE I HAD TO RUN
BACK OVER ARE HE WAS SAYING
THAT, YES, IN FACT, ANOTHER TRAIN FROM PAN AM DID DERAIL
ALMOST AT THE SAME SPOT HE SAID
ABOUT TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO IN 2014 AND HE EXPRESSED A
CONCERN WHY THIS WOULD HAPPEN
ON SUCH A CLEAR WEATHER DAY AND DIDN'T SEEM TO BE ANY
PARTICULAR OUTSIDE FACTOR THAT
IS OBVIOUS TO HIM AT THIS POINT AS TO WHY THIS WOULD HAVE
HAPPENED.
THAT'S WHY THE INVESTIGATION, OF COURSE, TAKES PLACE.
I HAVE REACHED OUT TO PAN AM
RAILWAYS. AS SOON AS WE HEAR BACK WE WILL
BRING THAT YOU UPDATE.

&gt;&gt;&gt; FOX25 INVESTIGATES THE
FIRST TO TELL YOU ABOUT A NEW LAWSUIT A 12-YEAR VETERAN WAS
SUSPENDED FROM THE FORCE IN
AUGUST. GUTWELL SAID IT WAS RETALIATION
BECAUSE HE REPORTED CORRUPTION
IN THE DEPARTMENT. IN FEBRUARY, GUTWELL-MADE A
FORMAL COMPLAINT ACCUSING
OFFICERS OF MISCONDUCT. HE CLAIMS THAT THEY ALLOWED TO
BUY FOR PERSONAL USE DRUGS, AND
CHEATED ON TIME CARDS. GUTWELL'S LAWYER SPOKE TO
FOX25.
&gt;&gt; DESPITE STATEMENTS THAT RETALIATION WOULD NOT BE
TOLERATED SORTLY THEREAFTER
THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT HAPPENED.
&gt;&gt; HE SAYS HIS LAWSUIT LACKS
FACT AND AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION SHOW NO VALIDITY
TO THE ALLEGATIONS AND IN
SEVERAL INSTANCES, GUTWELL WAS UNTRUTHFUL.
HE PREVIOUSLY WORKED AS A
POLICE OFFICER AND HE SUED THAT DEPARTMENT AND THE CASE WAS
SETTLED AND HE GOT AWAY WITH AN
UNDISCLOSED SUM.</description>

A CUP OF THESE ACCIDENTS, 128
 NORTHBOUND, THAT ACCIDENT AFTER GREAT PLAIN AVE.
CLOSER IN THE CITY MUSEUM WAY,
AN ACCIDENT AT ROUTE 28, OAT BRIAN HIGHWAY.
YOU CAN SEE ALSO THE EXPRESSWAY
REALLY STARTING TO GET JAMMED UP FROM QUINCY AND HEAD INTO
MILTON.
SHIFTING DOWN SOUTH A LITTLE BIT, ROUTE 3 SOUTHBOUND, AN
ACCIDENT AT 2  28  HINGHAM
STREET. KEEP THAT IN MIND AND FROM THE
RED LINE, EXPECT MINOR
NORTHBOUND DELAYS BECAUSE EARLIER TRACK WORK THAT WAS
TAKING PLACE.
ONE OF OUR LIVE CAMERAS, THE TRAFFIC MOVING THROUGH
SOMERVILLE.
93 SOUTHBOUND. YOU SEE THE HEADLIGHTS BUT
VOLUME ARE STARTING TO BUILD.
DRIVE TIMES FOR YOU. THE PIKE 27 MINUTES.
THE EXPRESSWAY, THAT IS THE
SLOW SPOT FROM THE SPLIT TO THE PIKE JAMMED UP 24 MINUTES.
AND 128 TO PEABODY AND THE
WESTON TOLLS, 28 MINUTES AND YOU MAY BE IN FOR A TREAT AS
YOU HEAD HOME THIS AFTERNOON
BECAUSE SHIRI, YOU ARE TRACKING A WARM TWO DAYS.
&gt;&gt; Shiri:  TWO DAYS.
TEASING YOU WINDOWS DOWN FOR THE DRIVE HOME FROM WORK.
60s FOR TODAY AND TOMORROW
AFTERNOON. AVERAGE HIGH 56 DEGREES.
WE ARE RUN BEING 10 TO PERHAPS
EVEN 15 DEGREES ABOVE AVERAGE IN A COUPLE OF SPOTS.
IT GETS COLD AGAIN.
WE TALK ABOUT THE FLURRIES OVER THE WEEKEND BUT IN THE
MEANTIME, LET'S ENJOY THAT 53
IN BOSTON, 51 IN LAWRENCE, 51 IN NORWOOD.
FITCH BURKE AT 48 DEGREES.
CLEAR SKIES. NOT MUCH WIND AND WE DON'T EVEN
HAVE TO TALK ABOUT 9 WIND
WIND CHILLS TODAY. PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES WILL LAST
US THROUGH MUCH OF THE MORNING
COMMUTE HERE. WE WILL KEEP THINGS MOSTLY
CLOUDY AND 48 DEGREES THROUGH 8
A.M. 10  A.M. IN FITCHBURG.
UPPER 50s THIS AFTERNOON.
BRIGHTEST TIME WILL TEND BE AROUND LUNCHTIME AND MORE
CLOUDS THAN THANK MOVE IN.
MORE CLOUD COVER NORTH OF BOSTON TODAY, PARTLY CLOUDY
SKIES IN IPSWICH AT 65.
BOSTON AT 65. MID-60s LAWRENCE UP TO
MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE.
WORCESTER ONLY 62 THERE. WE HAVE MID AND LOWER 60s
THROUGH SOUTHEASTERN MASS AND
THE BRIGHTEST CONDITIONS OF ALL DEVELOPING THERE THIS
AFTERNOON.
CLOSER TO THE FRONT UP NORTH AND KEEP THE FOCUS OF THE
CLOUDS NORTH OF BOSTON HERE BUT

WINDS PUSHING THOSE
TEMPERATURES ABOVE AVERAGE. AFTER MIDNIGHT, YOU CAN SEE A
COUPLE OF SPRINKLES UP ACROSS
THE MASS NEW HAMPSHIRE BORDER AND THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE FOR
THE MORNING COMMUTE TOMORROW.
I THINK THE MORNING COMMUTE WILL BE DRY FOR MANY OF YOU.
PRETTY EASY GOING.
ONCE WE HIT ABOUT NOONTIME, SCATTERED RAIN UP INTO SOUTHERN
NEW HAMPSHIRE, AND THE MAIN
RAIN ARRIVES IN WORCESTER AROUND 2 OR 3:00 IN THE
AFTERNOON PEAKING IN BOSTON
DURING THE MORNING COMMUTE AND DRY OUT AS WE HIT THE EVENING
HOURS AND TURNING VERY BREEZY
AND COOL AS WE SHIFT INTO YOUR FRIDAY.
RAIN TOTALS FROM A 10th TO A
QUARTER INCH OF RAIN IN SOUTHWESTERN NEW HAMPSHIRE.
PROBABLY ABOUT HALF AN INCH OF
RAIN AND NOT A DROUGHT MUSTER, BUT WE CAN USE THE SHOWERS.
THERE WE GO, BREEZY AND BRIGHT
AT 53. HIGHS AROUND 50.
OVER THE WEEKEND, A SLIGHT RISK
OF A TEMPERATURE IN OR AFTERNOON SPRINKLES BOTH DAYS.

      <description>LONG.
&gt;&gt;&gt; HAPPENING TODAY, CLEANUP
CREWS ARE READING TO WESTFORD TO GET TRAINS BACK ON THE
TRACK.
&gt;&gt; A LIVE LOOK IN WESTFORD WHERE SIX CARS CAME OFF THE
TRACK.
CLOSE TO THE SPOT WHERE A TRAIN WENT OFF THE TRACKS JUST TWO
YEARS AGO RIGHT THERE.
MICHAEL HENRICH IS LIVE IN WESTFORD AND MICHAEL, INITIAL
LEGAL WAS CONCERN THIS COULD BE
A HAZMAT SITUATION. &gt;&gt; Reporter: AS YOU CAN SEE
FROM THIS OVERPASS AT BROADWAY
AND RIVER STREET, THEY ARE STILL EXAMINING THE ACTUAL
TRAIN CARS THAT DERAILED.
IT WAS BRIEFLY CONSIDERED A HAZMAT SITUATION, BUT AS YOU
TAKE A LOOK AT SOME PICTURES I
WANT TO SHOW THAT YOU WERE SENT IN FROM A VIEWER, I DO HAVE THE
COMFORTING INFORMATION FROM
FIRE OFFICIALS THAT IS NO LONGER AN ONGOING CONCERN, THE
HAZMAT SITUATION.
IT WAS INITIALLY CALLED OUT AS A TIER ONE, WHICH IS THE LOWEST
LEVEL OF POSSIBLE HAZMAT
SITUATION. NOW THIS TRAIN DERAILED.
THIS PAN AM RAIL TRAIN DERAILED
A LITTLE AFTER 8:30 LAST NIGHT. AND WHEN THEY WERE SO CONCERNED
ABOUT THE HAZMAT SITUATION,
TOWN OFFICIALS CONSIDERED USING REVERSE 911 CALL TO WARN NEARBY
RESIDENTS BUT DECIDED AGAINST 2
IT AS WE ARE LEARNING THAT NONE OF THE MATERIALS ARE ACTUALLY
SPILLED.
SO THE INVESTIGATION INTO WHY THE TRAIN CARS DERAILED IS
ONGOING.
I HAVE REACHED OUT TO PAN AM RAILWAYS THIS MORNING FOR
COMMENT.
IT IS INTERESTING YOU NOTED THAT THE LOWELL SUN REPORTED
THIS DERAILMENT IS NOT FAR FROM
ANOTHER FREIGHT DERAILMENT IN 2014.
THE REASON BEING THAT TIME THE
SUN REPORTS THAT TOWN OFFICIALS GREW FRUSTRATED BY THE LACK OF
COMMUNICATION FROM PAN AM.
THIS TIME THE TOWN WAS QUICKLY NOTIFIED.
NO INJURIES WERE REPORTED WITH
THIS DERAILMENT, AND THEY DO EXPECT WHEN THE SUN RISES TO
RIGHT THESE CARS WHEN THAT
HAPPENS.</description>

WE GET IT.
&gt;&gt;&gt; QUESTIONS ARE SWIRLING OF A WOMAN FOUND DEAD OUTSIDE OF AN
APARTMENT BUILDING.
POLICE SPENT TWO HOURS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO SHE WAS.
STEPHANIE COUEIGNOUX IS LIVE IN
LAWRENCE THIS MORNING WITH WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: INVESTIGATORS
SAYING HER DEATH IS SUSPICIOUS BUT THEY DON'T KNOW AND THEY
ARE NOT RELEASING EXACTLY HOW
SHE DIED. TAKING A LOOK BEHIND ME, THIS
IS THE APARTMENT COMPLEX ON
EXCHANGE STREET WHERE THEY FOUND HER BODY; HOWEVER, THEY
ARE NOT SAYING AND DON'T KNOW
WHETHER SHE LIVES HERE OR WAS JUST FOUND HERE.
ALSO WANT TO GIVE YOU A BETTER
IDEA OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE ALL OF THIS HAPPENED.
YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS APARTMENT
IS ROUNDED BY HOMES, POSSIBLY SOMEONE MAY HAVE SEEN SOMETHING
YESTERDAY MORNING.
KNEW SPOKESPERSON FOR THE ESSEX COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S
OFFICE SAYS THE WOMAN'S DEATH,
AGAIN, IS SUSPICIOUS BUT NOT SAYING EXACTLY HOW SHE DIED.
THEY ARE SAYING THAT THE
MEDICAL EXAMINER IS EXPECTED TO DETERMINE THAT TODAY AND WILL
NOT TRY TO RELEASE THAT
INFORMATION BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT TO COMPROMISE THAT
INVESTIGATION AND STILL A LOT
OF QUESTIONS LEFT UNANSWER AND WHO THIS WOMAN IS, WHETHER SHE
LIVES HERE AND EXACTLY HOW SHE
DIED. ACCORDING TO THE DA'S OFFICE,
THE WOMAN DIED BETWEEN 5 AND 7
YESTERDAY MORNING. THEY DESCRIBE HER AS HISPANIC
BETWEEN 50 AND 60 YEARS OLD.
SHE WAS FOUND COMPLETELY CLOTHED INCLUDING A BLACK WOOL
COAT.
SHE WAS WEARING HER SNEAKERS AND HER JEWELRY WAS ALSO ON
HER, THE DA'S OFFICE IS NOT
SAYING WHETHER THEY HAD ANY SUSPECTS.
WE ARE HOPING TO SPEAK WITH
PEOPLE HERE AT THIS APARTMENT COMPLEX, AND WE ARE REACHING
OUT TO THE DA'S OFFICE.
AS SOON AS WE GET AN UPDATE, OF COURSE, WE WILL LET YOU KNOW.

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW HOLIDAYS ARE
STARTING WITH STARBUCKS WITH
THEIR HOLIDAY CUPS. A GREEN CUP AND 100 PEOPLE
DRAWN IN A SINGLE LINE TO
REPRESENT UNITY. STARBUCKS MAY BE GOING GREEN
BEFORE THEY GO RED.
LOOK AT THIS CUP, IT IS RED MORE LIKE THE ANNUAL HOLIDAY
CUP WE ARE USED TO SEE.
EVERY YEAR THE CUPS ARE SHIPPED IN STORES IN BOXES NO PEEKING
AND SOMEBODY PEEKED AND POSTED
THIS PICTURE ON REDDIT. STARBUCKS SAY THE REST OF THEIR
HOLIDAY PLANS, GIFTS FOR ME.
&gt;&gt; Shiri:  GIFTS FOR GENE. &gt;&gt; Gene:  GIFTS ARE PROBABLY
WRAPPED.
GET IT DONE EARLY. &gt;&gt; Sara:  I COULD USE A TALL
ONE WITH A LITTLE BIT OF CREAM.
FIRST SHIRI GO FOR THE ICE COULD --
&gt;&gt; Shiri:  GO FOR THE ICE
COFFEE. KEVIN LEMANOWICZ HAS ICE COFFEE
ALL YEAR ROUND WHICH IS WEIRD
TO ME. GRAB THE ICE COFFEE NOW.
WE DON'T HAVE ANY WIND CHILLS
TO TALK ABOUT. WE DON'T HAVE ANY RAIN TO TALK
ABOUT.
WE HAVE CLOUDS TO TALK ABOUT. HANG OUT IN THE LOWER 50s FOR
THE MORNING COMMUTE IN THE
BOSTON AREA. RUNNING MOSTLY CLOUDY.
THINGS BRIGHTEN UP LIGHT
MORNING INTO THE EARLY AFTERNOON.
WE SHIFT INTO THE LOWER 60s AND
BEFORE WE KNOW IT IN THE MID- TO UPPER 60s THIS AFTERNOON AND
WILL BE REALLY MILD.
YOU KNOW WHAT, WILL FEEL MORE LIKE LATE SEPTEMBER THAN IT
WILL EARLY NOVEMBER SO WE DRAG
IN A COUPLE MORE OF THOSE AFTERNOON CLOUDS.
WE HAVE ALL THIS WARM AIR
MOVING IN ALONG THE WARM FRONT, BUT ALONG IT, INCREASING
MOISTURE SO THE RESULT IS THIS.
NOT PICTURE PERFECT BUT THE BRIGHTEST TIME OF THE DAY IS
PROBABLY SMACK-DAB IN THE
MIDDLE RIGHT AROUND LUNCHTIME. THE FURTHER NORTH WE GO, BUT
OVERALL KEEP THINGS DRY AND
MILD. 6 IN BOSTON AND LAWRENCE.
65 IN NASHUA.
UPPER 60s IN MAYNARD, FRAMINGHAM.
AND WORCESTER AT 62 DEGREES.
67 IN BROCKTON. MID-60s MARSHFIELD DOWN TO
PLYMOUTH AND LOWER 60s WITH
FROM THE CAPE AND ISLAND. THESE RUN THE BRIGHTEST OF ALL
FOR THE AFTERNOON.
HIGH TEMPERATURES TOMORROW, DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN WITH THE 60s
AND BRING IN RAIN.
STARTING THINGS OFF WITH THE POTENTIAL OF DRIZZLE NORTHERN
MASS AND SOUTHERN NEW
HAMPSHIRE. BOSTON POINTS SOUTH WILL STAY
DRY THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE DAY.
 AT NOONTIME, THE CHANCE OF RAIN FOCUSED FAR NORTH OF
BOSTON.
3 P.M. SHOWERS IN THE WORCESTER AREA.
SHOWERS PEEKING AROUND 5 OR 6
P.M. IN BOSTON. THAT MEANS WE ARE LOOKING AT A
VERY WET DRIVE HOME FROM WORK
TOMORROW. FRIDAY, BRIGHT AND BREEZY AND
53 OVER THE WEEKEND AND CHILLY
TEMPERATURES. HIGHS ONLY AROUND 50.
SLIGHT RISK OF A SPRINKLE OR
FLURRIES BOTH DAYS. SATURDAY LOOKS A LITTLE BIT
BRIGHTER.
CATHERINE PARROTTA UP NOW LIVE DRIVE TIME TRAFFIC THIS
MORNING.
CATHERINE, STILL A PRETTY GOOD TIME TO HIT THE ROADS.
&gt;&gt; LOOKING GOOD.
STARTING TO SEE SLOWDOWN IN THE USUAL SPOTS.
NOTHING TOO SEVERE.
128 STILL A GOOD RIDE IN BOTH DIRECTIONS.
93 STARTING TO SLOW DOWN
THROUGH BURLINGTON, WOBURN. SLOW FROM QUINCY ALL THE WAY
JUST ABOUT THE CITY AND THAT
ICON JUST POPPED UP AS WE WERE STANDING HERE.
CHECK ON DETAILS ON THAT FOR
YOU FOR THE UPDATE. PEED CHECK ON THE EXPRESSWAY.
AVERAGING 28 MILES PER HOUR.
SHIFTING WEST NO PROBLEMS. PIKE DOING JUST FINE.
A LOOK AT OUR LIVE CAMERAS,
EASTBOUND THROUGH BRIGHTON. VOLUME STARTING TO PICK UP AND
NOT TOO CONCERNING AT THIS
HOUR. THE LIVE DRIVE TIMES.
THE PIKE 14 MINUTES.
FROM THE TOLLS TO THE TED WILLIAMS, 13 MINUTES.
FROM THE EXPRESSWAY TO THE
PIKE, THE SLOW AREA WE WERE TALKING ABOUT AVERAGING 17
MINUTES.
ALREADY JAMMED IN SOME SPOTS THERE.
BETWEEN, OVER TO YOU.
&gt;&gt; Gene:  5:5. THREE MONTHS SINCE THE
COLD-BLOODED KILLER TOOK THE
LIFE OF VANESSA MARCOTTE, THE 27-YEAR-OLD.
THE KILLER LEFT CLUES.
&gt;&gt; MORE CONSISTENT WITH SOMEONE WHO IS PSYCHOPATHIC WHICH MEANS
SOMEONE WITH NO REMORSE FOR
WHAT THEY HAVE DONE, AND THEY WILL NOT BE HUNKERED DOWN SOME
PLACE FEARFUL THAT THEY ARE
GOING TO BE CAUGHT. &gt;&gt; Gene:  WHERE DOES MARY ELLEN

FIRST TO TELL YOU ABOUT A NEW
LAWSUIT FILED BY A FRAMINGHAM POLICE DETECTIVE.
HIS CHIEF IN THE TOWN.
LIEUTENANT GUTWELL, A 12-YEAR TO VETERAN WAS SUSPENDED

IN THE LAWSUIT, HIS SUSPENSION WAS RETALIATION BECAUSE HE
REPORTED CORRUPTION IN THE
DEPARTMENT. IN FEBRUARY, GUTWELL-MADE A
FORMAL COMPLAINT ACCUSING
FELLOW OFFICERS OF MISCONDUCT. ALLOWED CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANTS
TO TAKE DRUGS FOR PERSONAL USE,
TOOK ME MEN KNOW TOES FROM CRIME SCENE.
&gt;&gt; DESPITE REPUTATION THAT
RETALIATION AGAINST HIM WOULD NOT BE TOLERATED, SHORTLY
THEREAFTER.

AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION SHOWED NO VALIDITY TO THE
ALLEGATIONS AND SEVERAL
INSTANCES, GUTWELL WAS UNTRUTHFUL.
GUTWELL PREVIOUSLY WORKED AS A
LAW OFFICER IN ASHLAND AND SUED THAT DEPARTMENT AND THAT CASE
WAS SETTLED AND GUTWELL WALKED

      <description>&gt;&gt; THE COUNTDOWN FOR ELECTION
DAY STANDS AT SIX,  AND ATTACKS
ARE GETTING MORE PERSONAL. CLINTON SUPPORTERS ARE PUSHING
A MESSAGE THAT IS MORE
ANTI-TRUMP THAN PRO CLINTON. FOX25'S DANIEL MILLER JOINS US
NOW.
CLINTON HAS A LOT TO WORRY ABOUT WITH THE POLLS GETTING
MUCH TIGHTER.
&gt;&gt; Daniel:  THE LATEST REAL CLEAR POLITICS POLL SHOW
HILLARY CLINTON WITH JUST A
2-POINT LEAD OVER DONALD TRUMP WITHIN THE MARGIN OF ERROR AND
THAT POLL ISN'T THE ONLY ONE.
A "WASHINGTON POST" POLL SHOW TRUMP WITH A 1 PERCENT LEAD
NATIONALLY, A DRAMATIC SHIFT
FROM JUST A WEEK AGO. AMID TIGHTENING POLLS AND A
LATE OCTOBER CURVEBALL FROM THE
FBI, THE CLINTON CAMP IS SHIFTING FOCUS TO TRUMP AND THE
CONTROVERSIES THAT HAVE ROYLD
HIS WHITE HOUSE BID. A NEW AD OF HIS PAST COMMENTS
ABOUT WOMEN.
&gt;&gt; PUTTING A WIFE TO WORK IS A VERY DANGEROUS THING.
WHEN I COME HOME AND DINNER IS
NOT READY, I GO THROUGH THE ROOF.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: CLINTON ECHOING
THAT LINE OF ATTACK IN THE KEY SWING STATE OF FLORIDA.
&gt;&gt; HE SURE HAS SPEMENT A LOT OF
TIME DEMEANING, DEGRADING, INSULTING AND ASSAULTING WOMEN.
&gt;&gt; TRUMP NEVER ONE TO SHY AWAY
FROM CONFLICT GOING AFTER CLINTON AND THE PRESIDENT OVER
OBAMACARE.
&gt;&gt; HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO EXPAND OBAMACARE AND MAKE IT
EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: TRUMP CONTINUING TO FACE LESS THAN ENTHUSIASTIC
SUPPORT FROM SOME IN THE
ESTABLISHMENT WING OF HIS OWN PARTY.
HOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN SAID HE
VOTED BUT HE AVOIDED MENTIONING TRUMP'S NAME.
&gt;&gt; I ALREADY VOTED FOR OUR
NOMINEE LAST WEEK IN EARLY VOTING.
WE NEED TO SUPPORT OUR ENTIRE
REPUBLICAN TICKET. &gt;&gt; Reporter: OHIO GOVERNOR JOHN
KASICH IS UNDER FIRE AFTER
ANNOUNCING THAT HE WILL NOT VOTE FOR TRUMP.
KASICH WROTE IN 2008 NOMINEE
JOHN McCAIN'S NAME ON TOP OF HIS BALLOT.
ACTION THAT DREW CRITICISM FROM
FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE RICK SANTORUM.
&gt;&gt; I AM NOT HAPPY WITH JOHN
KASICH AND PAUL RYAN WITH THE WAY THEY CONSULT.
JOHN, YOU SIGNED A PLEDGE.
YOU SIGNED A PLEDGE SAYING WOULD YOU SUPPORT THE
REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR
PRESIDENT. &gt;&gt; AND THE CANDIDATES ARE ALSO
RAMPING UP THEIR CAMPAIGN STOPS
IN THE FINAL DAYS. HILLARY CLINTON IS IN LAS VEGAS
AND ARIZONA.
MASSACHUSETTS SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN IS ALSO IN NEVADA
STUMPING FOR CLINTON.
DONALD TRUMP IS MAKING THREE STOPS IN THE PATELGROUND STATE
OF FLORIDA.

GOVERNOR BAKERS PLAN TO LEAVE HIS PRESIDENTIAL BALLOT BLANK.
HE VOTED FOR A PRESIDENT EVERY
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION SINCE 19LE 0, BUT THIS YEAR HE IS DIN
COURAGEED BY THE NOMINEES.
&gt;&gt; I SAID MONTHS AND MONTHS AGO THAT I DIDN'T THINK THAT DONALD
TRUMP HAD THE TEMPERAMENT TO BE
PRESENT AND HILLARY CLINTON HAD BELIEVABILITY ISSUES AND
NOTHING HAPPENED BETWEEN NOW

      <description>THEY ROLL IN IN.
&gt;&gt;&gt; TIME CHECK YOUR TRAFFIC.
HOW THE ROADS ARE DOING. 5:17 ON YOUR WEDNESDAY MORNING.
TAKING A LOOK AT THAT MAP.
THE GOOD NEWS IS A LOT OF GREEN NORTH OF THE CITY 128, 93 DOING
OKAY.
128 SOUTH.  CITY NO PROBLEMS.
A LITTLE SLOWDOWN ON THE
EXPRESSWAY BETWEEN QUINCY AND DORCHESTER AS YOU TRY WORK YOUR
WAY NORTH.
THIS ACCIDENT ON THE MAP 145 REVERE BEACH PARKWAY.
A CONGESTED AREA BUT PRETTY
EARLY AND THAT WILL BE CLEARED UP SOON.
TAKING A LIKE AT ONE OF OUR
LIVE CAMERAS, ZAKIM BRIDGE, LEVERETT CONNECTOR.
VOLUME VERY LIGHT.
DRIVE TIMES FOR YOU ON THE PIKE, 22 MINUTES.
ON THE EXPRESSWAY, 9 MINUTES,
SMOOTH SAILING. 128 TO ROUTE 1 TO THE WESTON
TOLLS WILL TAKE YOU 21 MINUTES
RIGHT NOW. AND SHIRI, YOU MIGHT NOT NEED
THE HEAT IF YOU WERE DRIVING TO
WORK THIS EARLY HOUR. &gt;&gt; Reporter: MAYBE THAT.
I AM THINKING FOR THE AFTERNOON
THE WIND IS DOWN. WHEN WE ARE TALKING
TEMPERATURES IN THE 60s, CLOSE
TO 70s. TO ME IT MEANS TAKE A LITTLE
BREAK FROM THE AC AND HEAT AND
MAKE MOTHER NATURE MORE COMFORTABLE.
TEMPERATURES COME CRASHING DOWN
FRIDAY INTO THE WEEKEND. A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING.
SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS AND
FLURRIES IN THE FORECAST JUST IN THOSE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS.
SO CURRENT CONDITIONS HERE, 2
DEGREES IN BOSTON. 50 IN LAWRENCE.
49 IN WORCESTER.
AND 50 IN NORWOOD. OUT TO FITCHBURG AT 51 DEGREES.
WE DO HAVE THIS PARTLY CLOUDY
SKIES TO START THINGS OFF, AND WE ARE GOING TO DEAL WITH SOME
ON AND OFF CLOUDS, REALLY
THROUGHOUT THE DAY AHEAD. NOT AS BRIGHT AS YESTERDAY,
BUT, MAN, WARMER, 47 IN
FITCHBURG AT 7 A.M. 9 A.M. IN THE LOWER 50s.
WE GET UP TO 60 DEGREES AT 11
A.M. AND IN THE AFTERNOON WELL INTO
THE 60s HERE, BUT WE ALSO HAVE
TO ADD, AGAIN, A FEW OF THOSE CLOUDS.
THIS AFTERNOON I AM COUNTING ON
MORE CLOUDS THE FURTHER NORTH. 64 IN MANCHESTER, NEW
HAMPSHIRE.
62234 WORCESTER TODAY. 65 IPSWICH TO BOSTON.
67 IN FRAMINGHAM LOW TO MID-60s
WITH MORRISON OVER SOUTHEASTERN MASSACHUSETTS INCLUDING THE
CAPE AND ISLANDS.
THE REASON WE HAVE MORE CLOUDS IS WE ARE CLOSER TO THE FRONT.
A LOT OF WARM AIR THAT IS
COMING IN TODAY. IT DOES STAY DRY DESPITE THE
FACT MORE CLOUDS AROUND.
OVERNIGHT PATCHY DRIZZLE INTO MIDNIGHT AND THE MORNING
COMMUTE AND SPECIFICALLY
NORTHERN MASS AND SOUTHERN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND THAT IS THE SPOT
WE COULD DEAL WITH ON-AND-OFF
SHOWERS HERE. EARLIER TOMORROW.
EVEN AT NOONTIME, A LITTLE WET
IN SOUTHERN NEW HAMPSHIRE. SHOWERS IN WORCESTER AT 3, AND
THE RAIN PEAKING IN BOSTON
DURING THAT EVENING COMMUTE AND CLEARING OUT FOR YOUR THURSDAY
EVENING.
RAIN TOTALS WILL RANGE FROM A 10th TO A QUARTER INCH OF RAIN.
TOMORROW WE ARE STILL IN THE
60s. 63 DEGREES BRIGHT AND BREEZY ON
FRIDAY AND OVER THE WEEKEND A
SLIGHT RISK FOR EITHER SOME FLURRIES OR STRAY SPRINKLE.
NEITHER OF THOSE DAYS A WASHOUT
WITH MOSTLY DRY CONDITIONS. I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE CAUGHT
OFFGUARD.
BACK TO YOU, GUYS.</description>

A MAN WITH A LOADED GUN WALKS RIGHT UP TO THE CLERK AND
POINTS IT AT HIS HEAD.
HE TELLS THE KLSHING TO GET THE MONEY OUT OF THE CASH REGISTER.
THE GUN POINTED AT HIM THE
ENTIRE TIME. IT HAPPENED AT THE WILLOW
STREET MARKET IN HYANNIS.
THE ROBBER YELLS FOR CLERK TO GIVE HIM THE MONEY AND HE FIRES
THE GUN.

THAT IS WHEN THE CLERK REALIZES
THE MASKED MAN IS NOT MESSING AROUND.
HE QUICKLY GRABS CASH AND HANDS
IT TO THE MAN THAT RAN AWAY. WE SHOWED YOU THE ROBBER FIRED
THE GUN AND IT WAS QUICK.
A LITTLE TOO HARD TO SEE. THIS IS THE MOMENT THAT BULLET

I LAUGHED AT HIM AND HE SAID IT
TWICE. AND I LAUGHED AT HIM AGAIN.
AND THE THIRD TIME HE, LIKE,
FIRED THE GUN. &gt;&gt; Daniel:  THE WORKER DIDN'T
HIT IT GUN WAS REAL WHICH IS
WHY HE WASN'T SCARED AT FIRST. THE THANKFUL 21-YEAR-OLD SAID
HE JUST GOT MARRIED EIGHT

      <description>BE OKAY.
&gt;&gt;&gt; IN SITUATIONS LIKE THAT
CRASH WHERE RESCUERS HAVE TO USE SPECIAL SKILLS TO SAVE
PEOPLE TRAPPED INSIDE.
&gt;&gt; RESCUERS GAVE FOX25'S BLAIR MILLER THE UNIQUE TRAINING THEY
GO THROUGH TO PREPARE FOR THOSE
LIFE OR DEATH SITUATIONS. &gt;&gt;Reporter: IN KIND OF
GRAVEYARD FOR OLD TRUCKS, THE
RUSH TO-TO-SAVE SOMEONE COMES TO MIND.
&gt;&gt; ONE SIDE WILL SET UP.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THE FIRST RESPONDERS DIGGING, LIFTING AND
STRETCHING THEIR SKILLS TO SAVE
ONE POTENTIALLY TRAPPED UNDER SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
&gt;&gt; TODAY WE ARE LIFTING THE
TRUCK USING THRUSTS AND CHAINS. &gt;&gt; Reporter: FOR CAMBRIDGE FIRE
FIGHTER JAMES KENNEDY IT IS
INVALUABLE FOR A CAREER HE FOUND IN HIS OWN FAMILY FULL OF
RESCUERS.
&gt;&gt; WHEN MY FATHER AND GRANDFATHER WERE ON.
IT SEEMS LIKE THEY WERE JUST
FIGHTING FIRES AND NOW WE GET CALLS ANY TIME THERE IS A
SITUATION.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: EVEN A SITUATION LIKE YESTERDAY WHERE FIRE
FIGHTERS ENDED UP NEEDING THEIR
OWN HELP AFTER CRASHING INTO A CAR THEY SAY DIDN'T STOP.
&gt;&gt; WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GET
THIS PART RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Reporter: LIEUTENANT
SANTIAGO LASSA WITH THE BOSTON
FIRE DEPARTMENT SAY SITUATIONS LIKE THAT THAT THE CITY MUST
PREPARE FOR BECAUSE OF ALL THE
BIGGER TRUCKS ON THE ROAD MOSTLY BECAUSE NEW CONSTRUCTION
PROJECTS BUT START DEALING WITH
SOMETHING THAT WEIGHS 80,000 POUNDS, WHERE ALL THE HYDRAULIC
LIFTS COME INTO PLAY.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: INTO PLAY, PIECE BY PIECE, AND WHAT HAPPENED
HERE COULD BE THE KEYS TO
SURVIVING THE REAL THING. &gt;&gt; LIKE ANY PROFESSIONAL THING.
IF ONE GUY CAN'T DO HIS JOB AND
THE TEAM FAILS. IF THE TEAM FAILS, CANNOT MEET
OBJECTIVES MEANING YOU KENT GET
THEM OUT SAFE. &gt;&gt; Reporter: PART OF A LARGER
TRAINING EXERCISE AND HOW
PEOPLE CAN BE TRAPPED IN AN URBAN ENVIRONMENT.
EVEN WITH THIS SCENARIO IT CAN
GO OVER AND OVER IT. THE UNKNOWN YOU CAN'T PREPARE

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; 4:47.
WANT TO GIVE YOU A LOOK AT HOW
THE ROADS ARE DOING ON THIS WEDNESDAY MORNING.
NORTH OF THE CITY, 128, 93
MOVING ALONG FINE. PIKE ALL GREEN.
STILL THAT ACCIDENT ON THE MAP
NEAR ROUTE 24. NOT SEEING ANY DELAYS AROUND
IT.
THE ZAKIM BRIDGE MOVING WELL. ROUTE 1, 12 MINUTES.
93, TAKE YOU 20 MINUTES AND THE
PIKE FROM 495 TO MASS AVENUE, A 25-MINUTE RIDE.
NICE CLEAR VIEW OUT THERE.
&gt;&gt; Daniel:  IT IS. I WOKE UP AND I HAD A HAT ON AS
I WAS WALKING OUT THE DOOR AND
I GOT OUTSIDE AND I SAID, WHAT IS THIS?
&gt;&gt; Shiri:  ONLY GOING TO LAST
US TWO DAYS. IT IS REALLY WARM TODAY.
IT IS IN FACT RUNNING 10 TO 15
DEGREES WARMER. &gt;&gt; Catherine:  WOW.
&gt;&gt; Shiri:  YOU WILL NOTICE IF
FOR SURE. 49 DEGREES IN BOSTON.
NOT TAKE LONG BEFORE WE HIT 50.
PROBABLY AROUND O'CLOCK. IT UNTIL THAT, WE WILL HANG OUT
AROUND 49 DEGREES.
NO WIND AND WIND CHILL CONCERNS.
AND NO RAIN IN THE FORECAST BUT
MORE CLOUDS. AT 6 A.M., CLOSE TO 50 DEGREES.
8 A.M. CLOSE TO 50 DEGREES.
THERE ARE YOUR STEADY TEMPERATURES.
AFTER THAT MID-50s IN BOSTON.
BY 10 A.M., NOONTIME, 61. TEMPERATURES IN THE MID UPPER
60s THIS AFTERNOON.
RIGHT AROUND LUNCHTIME GOING TO BE OUR BRIGHTEST AND MORNING
CLOUDS AND AFTERNOON CLOUDS
THAT WILL END UP REDEVELOPING. WE HAVE HIGH PRESSURE OFF THE
COASTLINE AND BECAUSE OF ITS
POSITION AND THE WARM FRONT COMING TOWARD US.
ALL THE WARM WINDS FROM THE
SOUTHWEST ARE GOING TO HELP WITH TODAY'S WARM-UP.
SO YOU THINK ABOUT IT, YOU ARE
TRANSPLANTING ALL THAT HEAT FROM THE SOUTHERN UNITED STATES
AND DRAGGING IT INTO THE
NORTHEAST. NOONTIME, THERE IS YOUR
BRIGHTENING SKIES.
NORTHWARD THE CLOUDS ARE LINGERING AND SPOTS OVER THE
CAPE AS WELL.
AND NOT A PICTURE-PERFECT DAY IN THE RESPECT THAT WE ARE
GOING TO STAY PARTLY CLOUDY.
BUT AT LEAST WE ARE NOT SQUEEZING OUT ANY RAINDROPS.
THIS AFTERNOON 65 IN LOWELL,
BOSTON AND NEW HAMPSHIRE. AND ALL THE WAY BACK TO
FRAMINGHAM AND WESTBOROUGH
WORCESTER BACK TO 62. BRIGHTEST CONDITIONS THAT YOU
WILL FIND WILL BE OVER THE CAPE
AND ISLANDS LATER ON TODAY COUNTING ON THE SUNSHINE.
TEMPERATURES IN THE LOWER 60s
OVER THE CAPE. 64 IN PLYMOUTH AND 66  IN
BRIDGEWATER.
IF TODAY IS NOT ENOUGH TO SOAK UP THE 6s, LET'S DO IT AGAIN
TOMORROW.
AND A BETTER BET YOU WILL GET MORE RAIN OUT THERE.
LOW TO MID-60s.
69 IN NORWOOD. WARMER DOWN HERE BECAUSE TAKE A
WHILE TO TURN WEST INTO
NORTHERN MASS EVEN IN THE MORNING BECAUSE WE HAVE THE
PWROPT.
A LITTLE PATCHY DRIZZLE FOR THE MORNING COMMUTE.
OVERALL WE CAN COUNT ON A LOT
OF CLOUDS FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE DAY AND SHOWERS DEVELOPING
DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE
DAY. WET SPOTS AND DRIZZLY SPOTS.
RIGHT ACROSS THAT MASS-NEW
HAMPSHIRE BORDER. AROUND 3 P.M., SOME OF THE
HEAVIER RAIN MOVING INTO
CENTRAL MASSACHUSETTS AND CLOSE TO 6 P.M., IT IS PEAKING IN AND
AROUND THE BOSTON AREA.
ABSOLUTELY YOUR THURSDAY EVENING COMMUTE WILL BE THE ONE
IMPACTED BY THOSE SHOWERS.
BEHIND IT, WE TURN BREEZY AND MUCH COOLER AS WE GET INTO YOUR
FRIDAY.
THE SEVEN-DAY FORECAST WITH THE WEEKEND FALLS VIEW.
THE NEXT TWO DAYS FEATURING THE
60s. RAIN SHOWERS MOVING IN
AFTERNOON AND EVENING.
BREEZY AND BRIGHTER ON FRIDAY WITH 53 DEGREES.
50s OVER THE WEEKEND.
GIVE YOU A SLIGHT CHANCE OF A LITTLE MORNING TEMPERATURE IN
OR AFTERNOON SPRINKLE BOTH
DAYS. I DON'T EXPECT MUCH TO COME
FROM IT.
 I DON'T HAVE ANY RAIN OR SNOW ACCUMULATION MAPS OR JUST A
THREAT THAT WILL BE OUT THERE
BECAUSE THINGS ARE A LITTLE UNSETTLED.
TEMPERATURE-WISE 50 DEGREES
BOTH DAYS. MONDAY OF NEXT WEEK 52 AND SUN
AND 55 ON TUESDAY.
BACK TO YOU.</description>

      <description>THE BAD TASTE IN THE MOUTH OF
POLICE AND PARENTS IN WALPOLE.
POLICE TELL FOX25 THE 6-YEAR-OLD'S PARENTS FOUND IN
APPLE-FLAVORED VODKA NIP BOTTLE
WHEN THEY CHECKED THEIR SON'S. SOMEONE GAVE THE NIP TO THE BOY
WHILE HE WAS TRICK AND TREATING
NEAR HAYNES AND BAYNE STREET. THEY ARE LUCKY HE DIDN'T TRY TO
OPEN THE BOTTLE.
&gt;&gt; WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT A NIP BOTTLE OF VODKA BUT THE SYMBOL
OF AN APPEARLE IN FRONT OF IT.
ALMOST RESEMBLES SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE LIKE A FRUIT DRINK OR
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
&gt;&gt; Daniel:  LOWELL POLICE PUT A WARNING ONLINE AND A REVERSE
911 WARNING PEOPLE TO CHECK
THEIR CANDY.</description>

&gt;&gt;&gt; POLICE ARE LAWRENCE ARE INVESTIGATING THE DEATH OF A
WOMAN FOUND DEAD OUTSIDE AN
APARTMENT COMPLEX. HER DEATH IS SUSPICIOUS.
THE ESSEX DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S
OFFICE CONFIRMED HER IDENTITY BUT HAVEN'T BEEN RELEASED
BECAUSE OF PENDING
NOTIFICATION. HER BODY WAS FOUND AT THE
ENTRANCE OF THE RITA HALL
APARTMENTS ON EXCHANGE STREET. FOX25 INVESTIGATES AN
EXCLUSIVE.
A FRAMINGHAM POLICE DETECTIVE CLAIMS HE BECAME THE TARGET OF
THE TOWN AND HIS OWN DEPARTMENT
WHEN HE WENT TO THE FBI TO REPORT CASES OF CORRUPTION
INVOLVING FELLOW COPS.
TED DANIEL POURED THROUGH THE LAWSUIT THAT HIT THE DEPARTMENT
HARD.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: MORE TROUBLE FOR THE FRAMINGHAM POLICE
DEPARTMENT AND COMES IN THE
FORM OF A NEW FEDERAL LAWSUIT FILED BY NARCOTICS DETECTIVE

VETERAN OPINION THE 25-PAGE COMPLAINT BY FOX25 INVESTIGATES
NAMES THE TOWN AND POLICE CHIEF
KEN FERGUSON. SETH ROBBINS IS GUTWELL'S
ATTORNEY.
&gt;&gt; AS CORRUPT CONDUCT, HE SAID SOMETHING, AND NOW HE IS PAYING
THE PRICE.
THIS COMPLAINT WAS FILED IN FEDERAL COURT TO SEEK JUSTICE
AND NOTHING MORE.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: GILWELL CLAIMS HE FIRST BECAME A TARGET AFTER HE
ACCUSED A FELLOW DETECTIVE OF
MAKING FALSE STATEMENTS ON THE STAND UNDER OATH AND HIS STATUS
ONLY GOT WORSE WHEN HE TOOK
ANOTHER BLISTERING ACCUSATIONS TO THE FBI.
ACCORDING TO THE FEDERAL
LAWSUIT, GUTWELL TOLD FEDERAL AGENTS THAT HIS FELLOW OFFICERS
LET CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANTS BUY
DRUGS FOR THEIR OWN USE AND TOOK M MEMENTOS FROM CRIME
SCENES AND CLAIMED MULTIPLE
CHARGES WERE DOUBLE DIP, ESSENTIALLY BANKING REGULAR
DUTY PAY WHILE WORKING A DETAIL
AT THE SAME TIME. GUTWELL'S ATTORNEY CALLS HIM A
WHISTLE BLOWER AND CLAIMS THE
DEPARTMENT SUSPENDED HIM TO SILENCE HIM.
&gt;&gt; DESPITE REPRESENTATIONS THAT
RETALIATION AGAINST HIM WILL NOT BE TOLERATED.
SHORTLY THEREAFTER, THAT IS
PRECISELY WHAT HAPPENED. &gt;&gt; TED DANIEL, FOX25 NEWS
&gt;&gt; THE TOWN MANAGER TELLS FOX25
THAT GUTWELL'S LAWSUIT LACKED FACTS THAT THE TOWN CONDUCTED
AN EXTENSIVE INDEPENDENT
ALLEGATION OF FREE ALLEGATIONS BY LIEUTENANT GUTWELL IN EACH
OF THE CASES FOUND NO VALIDITY
TO THE ALLEGATION AND IN SEVERAL INSTANCES FOUND THAT
LIEUTENANT GUTWELL WAS
UNTRUTHFUL. HE WORKED AS A POLICE OFFICER

WOKE UP EVEN MORE HARROWING FROM THE SKY.
A TRUCK HIT THE CAR IN FRONT OF
HIM AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED CAUSING THAT CAR TO ROLL AND
CATCH FIRE.
&gt;&gt; THREE OTHER CARS WERE STRUCK IN A DOMINO EFFECT.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: TJ'S CAR.
IN AN INSTANT HE WENT FROM A VICTIM TO A HERO AND HEARD
DISTANT CRIMES FOR HELP FROM
THE DRIVER OF THE BURNING CAR. &gt;&gt; I PICKED HIM UP AND PULLED
HIM OUT THE CAR AND SOMEONE
ELSE CAME AND HELPED PULL HIM AWAY.
I GUESS IT WAS ADRENALINE.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: YOU DON'T THINK TWICE REACHING INTO A BURNING
CAR WHEN YOUR CAR WAS HIT.
&gt;&gt; I GOT OUT OF MY CAR AND WAS LIMPING.
MY CAR WAS NEXT TO THE
GUARDRAIL AND BE SOMEBODY WAS LIKE GET THAT GUY OUT OF THE
CAR.
&gt;&gt; WE ARE GREATFULIT WASN'T WORSE.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THE POLICE
SERGEANT SAY THE CALL THAT CAME IN.

FIRE. &gt;&gt; Reporter: SIMILAR TO WHEN

FIERY CRASH IN MIDDLEBOROUGH BY A WRONG-WAY DRIVER CAUSING
FIRST RESPONDERS THIS TIME TO
FEAR THE WORSE. &gt;&gt; OH, MY GOD, PLEASE NOT
AGAIN.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: BUT THE OUTCOME OF THIS CRASH AMAZINGLY MUCH
DIFFERENT.
ONLY MINOR INJURIES. &gt;&gt; I AM GRATEFUL, GRATEFUL.
ANY HIT-AND-RUN -- YOU THANK
GOD YOU WAKE UP THE NEXT DAY. &gt;&gt; Reporter: THE DRIVER OF THE
UTILITY TRUCK IS BEING CITED
FOR OPERATION TO ENDANGER. LOOKING WHETHER INATTENTION TO
THE ROAD AND FATIGUE MAY HAVE
PLAYED A ROAM IN THE COLLISION. THE DRIVER TOLD INVESTIGATORS
ON THE SCENE HE HAD WORKED IN
EXCESS OF 80 HOURS AT THE TIME OF THE CRASH.
I DID REACH OUT TO THE COMPANY

      <description>CONNECTOR WILL TAKE YOU 19
MINUTES RIGHT NOW.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 4:17 RIGHT NOW. METEOROLOGIST SHIRI SPEAR
SXWROYNG US OPINION ARE YOU
SURE IT IS -- &gt;&gt; Shiri:  GOING TO FEEL LIKE
LATE SEPTEMBER TODAY.
MY TREAT TO YOU GUYS. &gt;&gt; Catherine:  THANK YOU.
&gt;&gt; Shiri:  YOU ARE WELCOME.
YESTERDAY IT WAS COLD DRIVING TO WORK AND SCHOOL.
A MILDER AFTERNOON WITH
TEMPERATURES IN THE 60s. WE HAVE THURSDAY NIGHT, AND
RAIN WILL HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE
MORNING COMMUTE. WE HAVE FLURRIES POSSIBLE HERE
BOTH DAYS DURING THE AFTERNOON
AND THE AFTERNOON MILD ENOUGH FOR A COUPLE OF SPRINKLES.
NO ACCUMULATION EXPECTED, JUST
SOMETHING I DON'T WANT TO SURPRISE YOU OUT THERE.
SO WE HAVE GOT TEMPERATURES
RIGHT NOW AT 49 IN BOSTON AND IN WORCESTER.
WE ARE AT 45 IN NOR WOOD.
EVEN 50 DEGREES IN LAWRENCE. WE ARE NOT SEEING TOO MUCH
VARIATION IN THESE TEMPERATURES
TODAY. WE WILL FIND A FEW MORE CLOUDS
THE FURTHER NORTH YOU GO.
45 IN FITCHBURG. TEMPERATURES ARE NOT A BIG
ISSUE.
WIND CHILLS ARE NOT A BIG ISSUE AND TEMPERATURES BEYOND THE
BANNER GOING TO FIX BEEN MY
NEXT HIT. TEMPERATURES BILLION INTO THE
60s.
AND AFTER YOU GET EARLY MORNING CLOUDS.
BRIGHTEN UP LATE MORNING
THROUGH LUNCHTIME WHEN WE GET A FEW OF THOSE CLOUDS POPPING UP.
TEMPERATURE-WISE, 63 IN
HYANNIS. 62346 PLYMOUTH.
67 IN BOSTON.
I HAVE GOT FITCHBURG AT 58 DEGREES.
65  IN MANCHESTER, NEW
HAMPSHIRE. IMAGINE WE WILL HAVE MORE
CLOUDS NORTH AND THE REASON
BEHIND THAT. A FRONT THAT IS FOCUSED TO OUR
NORTH THAT WILL HAVE EARLY
MORNING CLOUDS. THIS IS 7 A.M. AND SEE THINGS
BRIGHTEN UP AS WE TRACK TOWARD
NOONTIME, SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST WINDS REALLY GOING TO HELP
BOOST TEMPERATURES.
CLOSER TO THAT FRONT INTO NEW HAMPSHIRE AS WELL AS NORTHERN
MASSACHUSETTS.
WE DO GET THAT EXTRA PUSH OF CLOUD COVER THAT IS PROBABLY
GOING TO HANG TIGHT THROUGH THE
AFTERNOON. EVEN BOSTON THROUGH
SOUTHEASTERN MASS, A PARTLY
CLOUDY DAY AND GET THAT LITTLE BIT OF A MIX INTO THE MORNING.
CLOUDY CONDITIONS TO START
THINGS OFF FOR THAT MORNING COMMUTE.
AS WITH GE THROUGHOUT DAY
POINTS NORTH AND WEST OF BOSTON AND THAT RISK OF SHOWERS
DEVELOPING BEFORE THAT MAIN
RAIN PRIMARILY DURING THE AFTERNOON AND YOU WILL NOTICE
AFTER NOONTIME THAT SHOWERS ARE
SPREADING IN. THE TIMELINE HAS THE HEAVIEST
BAND OF RAIN PUSHING FROM
WORCESTER THROUGH 5  P.M. AND CLOSER TO 7 P.M. IN THE BOSTON
AREA.
STILL A LITTLE BIT OF WIGGLE ROOM BUT MEANS DURING THE
EVENING COMMUTE WE WILL SEE THE
WIND MOVING IN AND LIMITED VISIBILITY FROM DOWNPOURS.
WINDING DOWN FROM THURSDAY
EVENING ENDING BY 11 P.M. OVER THE CAPE.
RAIN TOTALS HERE AND WE KNOW WE
ARE IN A RAIN. WE ARE IN A DROUGHT.
WE COULD USE IT.
MOSTLY A QUARTER INCH OF RAIN. EVEN LESS THAN THAT FROM
SOUTHEASTERN MASS.
A 10th OF AN INCH OF RAIN. NOT A WHOPPER OF A STORM.
BETTER CHANCE OF DOWNPOURS FROM
KEENE. AND COULD END UP WITH HALF AN
INCH OF RAIN.
NOT A DROUGHT BUSTER AND PLAIN SHOWERS FOR YOUR THURSDAY
AFTERNOON AND EVENING.
HIGH TEMPERATURES TOMORROW VERY WARM.
60 IN LAWRENCE.
69 IN NORWOOD AND 62 IN WORCESTER.
SEVEN-DAY FORECAST WITH THAT
WEEKEND ALWAYS FROM VIEW. HAVE US IN THE 60s THE NEXT TWO
DAYS WITH THE RAIN TOMORROW
SECOND HALF OF THE DAY. BREEZY AND BRIGHTER ON FRIDAY.
A TEMPERATURE AROUND 53
DEGREES. OVER THE WEEKEND, I MENTION
SOME FLURRIES AND SPRINKLES
POSSIBLE BOTH SAYS. IT WILL BE REALLY PATCHY IF WE
SEE IT.
KEEP IN MIND WE ARE WAKING UP TO THE 30s AND ONLY HIGHS
AROUND 50 BOTH DAYS.
BACK TO YOU, GUYS.</description>

&gt;&gt;&gt; THOUSANDS OF GIFTS MEANT
FOR HUNDREDS OF MILITARY FAMILIES THIS CHRISTMAS GO UP

PILL TO SWALLOW.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THE FLAMES CONSUME THE BUILDING.
&gt;&gt; I WAS DEVASTATED.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: JOHN COX GOT THE CALL OVER THE WEEKEND.
HE WAS THANKFUL NO ONE WAS
HURT, BUT CONCERNED THAT WHAT WAS INSIDE WOULD IMPACT
CHILDREN.
&gt;&gt; IT WAS THE BIGGEST PUNCH TO THE GUT COULD YOU TAKE.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THEY COLLECT
DONATED TOYS AND OTHER GIFTS TO HELP FAMILIES ON JOINT BASE
FOCUSED ON CELEBRATING THE
HOLIDAY WHEN MANY ARE SERVING AS ELECTED OFFICERS.
&gt;&gt; WHEN IT COMES CHRISTMASTIME
THE HEATING BILLS ARE GOING UP, GAS PILLS ARE GOING UP AND KIDS
ARE LOOKING FOR EVERYTHING
UNDER THE SUN FOR CHRISTMAS. &gt;&gt; Reporter: TYPICALLY ENOUGH
GIFTS FOR 800 CHILDREN AND HELP
KIDS FIND PARENTS FOR THEIR CHILDREN.
THE FIRE DESTROYED 1200 TOYS,
5,000 STOCKING STUFFIER AND 200 BACK PACKS FILLED WITH
SUPPLIES.
&gt;&gt; WE GOT WIPED OUT COMPLETELY ON FRIDAY NIGHT.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THE CHRISTMAS
PARTY IS SCHEDULED FOR DECEMBER 11 AND THE GOOD SPIRIT OF
STRANGERS IS HELPING.

      <description>DETERMINE IF THERE ARE ANY
CHARGES.
&gt;&gt;&gt; POLICE ARE LAWRENCE ARE INVESTIGATING THE DEATH OF A
WOMAN FOUND DEAD OUTSIDE AN
APARTMENT COMPLEX. HER DEATH IS SUSPICIOUS.
THE ESSEX DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S
OFFICE CONFIRMED HER IDENTITY BUT HAVEN'T BEEN RELEASED
BECAUSE OF PENDING
NOTIFICATION. HER BODY WAS FOUND AT THE
ENTRANCE OF THE RITA HALL
APARTMENTS ON EXCHANGE STREET. FOX25 INVESTIGATES AN
EXCLUSIVE.
A FRAMINGHAM POLICE DETECTIVE CLAIMS HE BECAME THE TARGET OF
THE TOWN AND HIS OWN DEPARTMENT
WHEN HE WENT TO THE FBI TO REPORT CASES OF CORRUPTION
INVOLVING FELLOW COPS.
TED DANIEL POURED THROUGH THE LAWSUIT THAT HIT THE DEPARTMENT
HARD.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: MORE TROUBLE FOR THE FRAMINGHAM POLICE
DEPARTMENT AND COMES IN THE
FORM OF A NEW FEDERAL LAWSUIT FILED BY NARCOTICS DETECTIVE
MATTHEW GOTWELL, A 12-YEAR
VETERAN OPINION THE 25-PAGE COMPLAINT BY FOX25 INVESTIGATES
NAMES THE TOWN AND POLICE CHIEF
KEN FERGUSON. SETH ROBBINS IS GUTWELL'S
ATTORNEY.
&gt;&gt; AS CORRUPT CONDUCT, HE SAID SOMETHING, AND NOW HE IS PAYING
THE PRICE.
THIS COMPLAINT WAS FILED IN FEDERAL COURT TO SEEK JUSTICE
AND NOTHING MORE.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: GILWELL CLAIMS HE FIRST BECAME A TARGET AFTER HE
ACCUSED A FELLOW DETECTIVE OF
MAKING FALSE STATEMENTS ON THE STAND UNDER OATH AND HIS STATUS
ONLY GOT WORSE WHEN HE TOOK
ANOTHER BLISTERING ACCUSATIONS TO THE FBI.
ACCORDING TO THE FEDERAL
LAWSUIT, GUTWELL TOLD FEDERAL AGENTS THAT HIS FELLOW OFFICERS
LET CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANTS BUY
DRUGS FOR THEIR OWN USE AND TOOK M MEMENTOS FROM CRIME
SCENES AND CLAIMED MULTIPLE
CHARGES WERE DOUBLE DIP, ESSENTIALLY BANKING REGULAR
DUTY PAY WHILE WORKING A DETAIL
AT THE SAME TIME. GUTWELL'S ATTORNEY CALLS HIM A
WHISTLE BLOWER AND CLAIMS THE
DEPARTMENT SUSPENDED HIM TO SILENCE HIM.
&gt;&gt; DESPITE REPRESENTATIONS THAT
RETALIATION AGAINST HIM WILL NOT BE TOLERATED.
SHORTLY THEREAFTER, THAT IS
PRECISELY WHAT HAPPENED. &gt;&gt; TED DANIEL, FOX25 NEWS
&gt;&gt; THE TOWN MANAGER TELLS FOX25
THAT GUTWELL'S LAWSUIT LACKED FACTS THAT THE TOWN CONDUCTED
AN EXTENSIVE INDEPENDENT
ALLEGATION OF FREE ALLEGATIONS BY LIEUTENANT GUTWELL IN EACH
OF THE CASES FOUND NO VALIDITY
TO THE ALLEGATION AND IN SEVERAL INSTANCES FOUND THAT
LIEUTENANT GUTWELL WAS

      <description>THERE.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 4:05.
POLICE BELIEVE A TIRED WORKER CAUSED THIS VIOLENT CRASH THAT
SHUT TOWN PART OF ROUTE 44 IN
MIDDLEBOROUGH. ONLY FOX 25'S ERIKA RICCI SPOKE
TO ONE OF THE DRIVERS INVOLVED.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S YOUR CAR? &gt;&gt; Reporter: HE SHOWS ME
PICTURES OF THE HORRIFIC
FIVE-CAR CRASH IN MIDDLEBOROUGH TUESDAY AFTERNOON ON THE DEVICE
THAT REFLECTS HIS INVOLVEMENT
IN IT. &gt;&gt; I WENT D AND THEN I WOKE UP.
&gt;&gt;Reporter: WHAT HE SAW WHEN HE
WOKE UP EVEN MORE HARROWING FROM THE SKY.
A TRUCK HIT THE CAR IN FRONT OF
HIM AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED CAUSING THAT CAR TO ROLL AND
CATCH FIRE.
&gt;&gt; THREE OTHER CARS WERE STRUCK IN A DOMINO EFFECT.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: TJ'S CAR.
IN AN INSTANT HE WENT FROM A VICTIM TO A HERO AND HEARD
DISTANT CRIMES FOR HELP FROM
THE DRIVER OF THE BURNING CAR. &gt;&gt; I PICKED HIM UP AND PULLED
HIM OUT THE CAR AND SOMEONE
ELSE CAME AND HELPED PULL HIM AWAY.
I GUESS IT WAS ADRENALINE.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: YOU DON'T THINK TWICE REACHING INTO A BURNING
CAR WHEN YOUR CAR WAS HIT.
&gt;&gt; I GOT OUT OF MY CAR AND WAS LIMPING.
MY CAR WAS NEXT TO THE
GUARDRAIL AND BE SOMEBODY WAS LIKE GET THAT GUY OUT OF THE
CAR.
&gt;&gt; WE ARE GREATFULIT WASN'T WORSE.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THE POLICE
SERGEANT SAY THE CALL THAT CAME IN.
&gt;&gt; CAR ROLLED OVER AND CAUGHT
FIRE. &gt;&gt; Reporter: SIMILAR TO WHEN
FOUR TEENS WERE KILLED IN A
FIERY CRASH IN MIDDLEBOROUGH BY A WRONG-WAY DRIVER CAUSING
FIRST RESPONDERS THIS TIME TO
FEAR THE WORSE. &gt;&gt; OH, MY GOD, PLEASE NOT
AGAIN.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: BUT THE OUTCOME OF THIS CRASH AMAZINGLY MUCH
DIFFERENT.
ONLY MINOR INJURIES. &gt;&gt; I AM GRATEFUL, GRATEFUL.
ANY HIT-AND-RUN -- YOU THANK
GOD YOU WAKE UP THE NEXT DAY. &gt;&gt; Reporter: THE DRIVER OF THE
UTILITY TRUCK IS BEING CITED
FOR OPERATION TO ENDANGER. LOOKING WHETHER INATTENTION TO
THE ROAD AND FATIGUE MAY HAVE
PLAYED A ROAM IN THE COLLISION. THE DRIVER TOLD INVESTIGATORS
ON THE SCENE HE HAD WORKED IN
EXCESS OF 80 HOURS AT THE TIME OF THE CRASH.
I DID REACH OUT TO THE COMPANY
NORTH EAST TRAFFIC CONTROL AND HAVE NOT YET HEARD BACK.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 4:17 RIGHT NOW. METEOROLOGIST SHIRI SPEAR
SXWROYNG US OPINION ARE YOU
SURE IT IS -- &gt;&gt; Shiri:  GOING TO FEEL LIKE
LATE SEPTEMBER TODAY.
MY TREAT TO YOU GUYS. &gt;&gt; Catherine:  THANK YOU.
&gt;&gt; Shiri:  YOU ARE WELCOME.
YESTERDAY IT WAS COLD DRIVING TO WORK AND SCHOOL.
A MILDER AFTERNOON WITH
TEMPERATURES IN THE 60s. WE HAVE THURSDAY NIGHT, AND
RAIN WILL HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE
MORNING COMMUTE. WE HAVE FLURRIES POSSIBLE HERE
BOTH DAYS DURING THE AFTERNOON
AND THE AFTERNOON MILD ENOUGH FOR A COUPLE OF SPRINKLES.
NO ACCUMULATION EXPECTED, JUST
SOMETHING I DON'T WANT TO SURPRISE YOU OUT THERE.
SO WE HAVE GOT TEMPERATURES
RIGHT NOW AT 49 IN BOSTON AND IN WORCESTER.
WE ARE AT 45 IN NOR WOOD.
EVEN 50 DEGREES IN LAWRENCE. WE ARE NOT SEEING TOO MUCH
VARIATION IN THESE TEMPERATURES
TODAY. WE WILL FIND A FEW MORE CLOUDS
THE FURTHER NORTH YOU GO.
45 IN FITCHBURG. TEMPERATURES ARE NOT A BIG
ISSUE.
WIND CHILLS ARE NOT A BIG ISSUE AND TEMPERATURES BEYOND THE
BANNER GOING TO FIX BEEN MY
NEXT HIT. TEMPERATURES BILLION INTO THE
60s.
AND AFTER YOU GET EARLY MORNING CLOUDS.
BRIGHTEN UP LATE MORNING
THROUGH LUNCHTIME WHEN WE GET A FEW OF THOSE CLOUDS POPPING UP.
TEMPERATURE-WISE, 63 IN
HYANNIS. 62346 PLYMOUTH.
67 IN BOSTON.
I HAVE GOT FITCHBURG AT 58 DEGREES.
65  IN MANCHESTER, NEW
HAMPSHIRE. IMAGINE WE WILL HAVE MORE
CLOUDS NORTH AND THE REASON
BEHIND THAT. A FRONT THAT IS FOCUSED TO OUR
NORTH THAT WILL HAVE EARLY
MORNING CLOUDS. THIS IS 7 A.M. AND SEE THINGS
BRIGHTEN UP AS WE TRACK TOWARD
NOONTIME, SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST WINDS REALLY GOING TO HELP
BOOST TEMPERATURES.
CLOSER TO THAT FRONT INTO NEW HAMPSHIRE AS WELL AS NORTHERN
MASSACHUSETTS.
WE DO GET THAT EXTRA PUSH OF CLOUD COVER THAT IS PROBABLY
GOING TO HANG TIGHT THROUGH THE
AFTERNOON. EVEN BOSTON THROUGH
SOUTHEASTERN MASS, A PARTLY
CLOUDY DAY AND GET THAT LITTLE BIT OF A MIX INTO THE MORNING.
CLOUDY CONDITIONS TO START
THINGS OFF FOR THAT MORNING COMMUTE.
AS WITH GE THROUGHOUT DAY
POINTS NORTH AND WEST OF BOSTON AND THAT RISK OF SHOWERS
DEVELOPING BEFORE THAT MAIN
RAIN PRIMARILY DURING THE AFTERNOON AND YOU WILL NOTICE
AFTER NOONTIME THAT SHOWERS ARE
SPREADING IN. THE TIMELINE HAS THE HEAVIEST
BAND OF RAIN PUSHING FROM
WORCESTER THROUGH 5  P.M. AND CLOSER TO 7 P.M. IN THE BOSTON
AREA.
STILL A LITTLE BIT OF WIGGLE ROOM BUT MEANS DURING THE
EVENING COMMUTE WE WILL SEE THE
WIND MOVING IN AND LIMITED VISIBILITY FROM DOWNPOURS.
WINDING DOWN FROM THURSDAY
EVENING ENDING BY 11 P.M. OVER THE CAPE.
RAIN TOTALS HERE AND WE KNOW WE
ARE IN A RAIN. WE ARE IN A DROUGHT.
WE COULD USE IT.
MOSTLY A QUARTER INCH OF RAIN. EVEN LESS THAN THAT FROM
SOUTHEASTERN MASS.
A 10th OF AN INCH OF RAIN. NOT A WHOPPER OF A STORM.
BETTER CHANCE OF DOWNPOURS FROM
KEENE. AND COULD END UP WITH HALF AN
INCH OF RAIN.
NOT A DROUGHT BUSTER AND PLAIN SHOWERS FOR YOUR THURSDAY
AFTERNOON AND EVENING.
HIGH TEMPERATURES TOMORROW VERY WARM.
60 IN LAWRENCE.
69 IN NORWOOD AND 62 IN WORCESTER.
SEVEN-DAY FORECAST WITH THAT
WEEKEND ALWAYS FROM VIEW. HAVE US IN THE 60s THE NEXT TWO
DAYS WITH THE RAIN TOMORROW
SECOND HALF OF THE DAY. BREEZY AND BRIGHTER ON FRIDAY.
A TEMPERATURE AROUND 53
DEGREES. OVER THE WEEKEND, I MENTION
SOME FLURRIES AND SPRINKLES
POSSIBLE BOTH SAYS. IT WILL BE REALLY PATCHY IF WE
SEE IT.
KEEP IN MIND WE ARE WAKING UP TO THE 30s AND ONLY HIGHS
AROUND 50 BOTH DAYS.
BACK TO YOU, GUYS.</description>

      <description>TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW AN OLD
CAR ENDED UP IN THE BOTTOM OF
WALDO LAKE. SKYFOX FLEW OVER DW PARK AS THE
CAR WAS PULLED FROM THE WATER.
A FISHERMAN NOTICED THE CAR WHEN WATER LEVELS WERE LOW BUT
IT WON'T VISIBLE UNTIL
YESTERDAY. &gt;&gt; THE MORE I STARED AT IT IT
LOOKED LIKE A CAR.
I COULD SEE THE WINDOWS AND STUFF LIKE THAT.
NOBODY AROUND TO HELP.
SO NEXT DAY I CAME BY AGAIN AND I COULD SEE THAT IT WAS A CAR.
&gt;&gt; TAKE A LOOK AT THAT CAR.
COVERED IN MUCK AND BEEN THERE FOR A WHILE.
DIVERS DID NOT FIND ANY SIGNS
OF VICTIMS IN THE WATER.</description>

      <description>SETTLED UP JUST ABOUT 5%.
&gt;&gt;&gt; THOUSANDS OF GIFTS MEANT
FOR HUNDREDS OF MILITARY FAMILIES THIS CHRISTMAS GO UP
IN FLAMES WHEN A BUILDING
CATCHES FIRE ON JOINT BASE CAPE COD.
NOW AS FOX25'S ROBERT GOULSTON
REPORTS, THE CLOCK IS TICKING AND CHARITY IS RACING TO
REPLACE ALL OF THE GIFTS BEFORE
THE HOLIDAY SEASON. &gt;&gt; THIS IS TOUGH -- A TOUGH
PILL TO SWALLOW.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THE FLAMES CONSUME THE BUILDING.
&gt;&gt; I WAS DEVASTATED.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: JOHN COX GOT THE CALL OVER THE WEEKEND.
HE WAS THANKFUL NO ONE WAS
HURT, BUT CONCERNED THAT WHAT WAS INSIDE WOULD IMPACT
CHILDREN.
&gt;&gt; IT WAS THE BIGGEST PUNCH TO THE GUT COULD YOU TAKE.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THEY COLLECT
DONATED TOYS AND OTHER GIFTS TO HELP FAMILIES ON JOINT BASE
FOCUSED ON CELEBRATING THE
HOLIDAY WHEN MANY ARE SERVING AS ELECTED OFFICERS.
&gt;&gt; WHEN IT COMES CHRISTMASTIME
THE HEATING BILLS ARE GOING UP, GAS PILLS ARE GOING UP AND KIDS
ARE LOOKING FOR EVERYTHING
UNDER THE SUN FOR CHRISTMAS. &gt;&gt; Reporter: TYPICALLY ENOUGH
GIFTS FOR 800 CHILDREN AND HELP
KIDS FIND PARENTS FOR THEIR CHILDREN.
THE FIRE DESTROYED 1200 TOYS,
5,000 STOCKING STUFFIER AND 200 BACK PACKS FILLED WITH
SUPPLIES.
&gt;&gt; WE GOT WIPED OUT COMPLETELY ON FRIDAY NIGHT.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THE CHRISTMAS
PARTY IS SCHEDULED FOR DECEMBER 11 AND THE GOOD SPIRIT OF
STRANGERS IS HELPING.
&gt;&gt; 41 DAYS FROM TODAY WE HAVE A PARTY FOR ALL OF THE KIDS.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: FIRE FIGHTERS
BELIEVE THAT ELECTRICAL ISSUES WERE THE FACTOR BUT HAVE NOT
BEEN ABLE TO PINPOINT THE EXACT
CAUSE. WE HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION ON

      <description>A WEDDING.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS IT.
&gt;&gt; SOME PEOPLE THINK THE PRANKSTER ON YOUTUBE IS THE
DEVIL HIMSELF, BUT IN THIS VIDEO
HE'S JUST DRESSED LIKE IT. HE'S DOING SOMETHING QUITE KIND
AND ANGELIC, GETTING INTO A RING
WITH A BULL. &gt;&gt; STUPIDEST THING I'VE EVER
DONE PROBABLY.
&gt;&gt; YOU SAID THERE WAS KINDNESS INVOLVED HERE.
&gt;&gt; THE KINDNESS COMES IN THE
FORM OF TEN SMALL PUMPKINS SCATTERED AROUND THE ARENA.
FOR EACH PUMPKIN THAT HE PICKS
UP, HE WILL DONATE $200 TO BREAST CANCER AWARENESS.
&gt;&gt; YEAH, GOOD WORK.
&gt;&gt; RELEASE THE CHIHUAHUA. &gt;&gt; THE CHIHUAHUA.
&gt;&gt; OH, WOW.
OH, GOSH. OH, GOSH.
OH!
&gt;&gt; WE'RE GOOD. WE'RE GOOD.
GOOD, GOOD, GOOD.
&gt;&gt; COME ON, RIGHT HERE. &gt;&gt; HERE HE COMES AGAIN.
&gt;&gt; NO!
&gt;&gt; VITALI GETS UPENDED, PUMPKINS GO FLYING, BUT HE'S BACK ON HIS
FEET.
&gt;&gt; WAIT, DOES IT COUNT IF HE SPILLS THE PUMPKINS, OR DOES HE
COLLECT THEM ALL OVER AGAIN?
&gt;&gt; COLLECT THEM, GET OUT OF THE RING.
&gt;&gt; COLLECT ALL THESE.
&gt;&gt; AHH! &gt;&gt; OH!
&gt;&gt; HE'S BACK ON HIS FEET, BUT
HE'S OUT OF THE RING. IN THE END, THAT BULL STOMPED
DOWN ON HIS HEAD, BUSTED HIS JAW
IN TWO PLACES, GAVE HIM A CONCUSSION, FRACTURED HIS ARM.
&gt;&gt; I'M GOOD.
I'M FINE. &gt;&gt; VITALE.
I GET IT, BUT IT'S DANGEROUS.
&gt;&gt; HE DOES LIKE CHALLENGES. EVEN THOUGH HE FAILED THIS ONE,
HE SAYS --
&gt;&gt; I'M STILL DONATING $2,000 TO BREAST CANCER AWARENESS.
&gt;&gt; WE WISH HIM A SPEEDY
RECOVERY. &gt;&gt; HOPEFULLY, HE DOESN'T NEED
THAT MONEY FOR HIS HOSPITAL
BILL. &gt;&gt; THIS IS JUST UGLY.
HERE YOU SEE A WOMAN EXITING A
SNACK SHOP. WALKS OUT, GIVES THE MAN A
SNACK, THEN HE REACHES OVER AND
HIS BIKE FALLS. HE GRABBED AT HER BREAST.
AS HE REACHED OVER TO SNATCH AT
HER, HIS BIKE HIT THE GROUND. &gt;&gt; THE LEVEL OF DISRESPECT IS ON
DISPLAY THERE.
HE'S GOT HIS TRANSACTION THERE, PERFECTLY ALLOWED TO DO THAT, AS
WELL.
&gt;&gt; SHE DIDN'T KNOW IT HAPPENED. SHE TURNED AROUND, HE COMPLETELY
MISSED HER.
SHE SAW IT LATER ON THE FOOTAGE AND WAS GOING TO WARN OTHER
WOMEN IN THE AREA, AS IS COMMON
IN TAIWAN FOR ATTRACTIVE WOMEN .
POLICE IN D.C. ARE SHARING THIS
VIDEO, BECAUSE THEY WANT TO CATCH THIS ROBBER.
LOOKS LIKE HE PUTS A DRINK ON
THE COUNTER, GRABBING IN HIS POCKET, ALMOST LIKE HE'S LOOKING
FOR HIS MONEY, THEN STEPS OUT OF
FRAME. THAT'S WHEN YOU SEE THE CLERK ON
THE GROUND SURRENDERING.
THIS MAN WALKS AROUND THE COUNTER AND IS DEMANDING MONEY.
WE SEE HIM WALK THROUGH THE
DOOR. &gt;&gt; ALL THE MONEY ON THAT
SECURITY SYSTEM.
&gt;&gt; RIGHT. THEY'VE GOT THE WINDOWS, THE
WINDOW PASS THROUGHS, ALL THAT
STUFF, ONLY TO LEAVE THE DOOR UNLOCKED?
&gt;&gt; DOOR WAS UNLOCKED, ROBBER
WALKS IN. HE'S GOT A GUN IN HIS HAND.
HE DROPS THE CLIP, AND AS HE
DROPS THE CLIP, THE CLERK RUNS AT HIM.
&gt;&gt; RUN AT HIM AGAIN, COME ON!
&gt;&gt; I WAS HOPING HE'D DO THE SAME, BUT HE HITS THE GROUND.
&gt;&gt; ALSO, IT'S NOT YOUR MONEY.
IT'S NOT EVEN THAT MUCH MONEY. DIDN'T PAY, WHAT, MINIMUM WAGE.
GIVE THE GUY WHAT HE WANTS.
&gt;&gt; HE DID JUST THAT. HE'S THERE AT THE REGISTER
TAKING ALL THE MONEY OUT AND NOW
THE MAN HAS HIM LYING FACE DOWN ON THE GROUND WITH THE REGISTER
OPEN AS HE RUMMAGES THROUGH
DRAWERS BEHIND THE COUNTER PUTTING HIS FINGERPRINTS
EVERYWHERE.
&gt;&gt; RUMMAGING AROUND BACK THERE. &gt;&gt; THE COPS MAKE THAT POINT AT
THE END OF THIS VIDEO.
FELLOW GETS AWAY, BUT YOU HAVE SEVERAL ANGLES OF HIS FACE.
HOPEFULLY, THEY CAN BRING HIM TO
JUSTICE. &gt;&gt; ONE OF MY FAVORITE, OKAY, HE
IS MY FAVORITE ANIMAL RESCUE.
I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO PRETEND. A SWAN FAMILY WAS IN DISTRESS.
HE SAYS THE MOM HAD A LAME LEG
AND THEY WERE MILES, MILES FROM WATER, AND THE CONCERN IS, THAT
WHEN YOU HAVE A MOM AND A DAD,
FIVE SWAN BABIES, THE PARENTS MIGHT JUST LEAVE THE BABIES
BEHIND.
SWANS, BEAUTIFUL, LOVELY, BUT CAN BE MEAN AND TERRITORIAL, AND
THEY'VE GOT A GROWL.
&gt;&gt; IS THAT LIKE A STRAIGHT JACKET FOR A SWAN?
&gt;&gt; THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT IS.
&gt;&gt; SWAN BAGS ON AMAZON. &gt;&gt; NO.
CAN'T GET THOSE ON AMAZON.
&gt;&gt; KIND OF A FAIRYTALE HAPPY ENDING FOR EVERYBODY AT THE END.
BUT THIS ONE, COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT. THIS MAN RIGHT THERE HAS A FROG,
HE WANTS THE FROG TO GO.
LET'S JUST SAY, I'LL BET ON THE FROG.
&gt;&gt; OH, OH, OH!
&gt;&gt; THE FROG REFUSES TO STAY IN THE POOL NET.
AND THIS MAN REFUSES TO GIVE UP.
&gt;&gt; AS MUCH AS THE FROG IS FIGHTING HIM, IT DOES NEED TO
GET OUT OF THE POOL.
ALL THAT CHLORINE IS NOT GOING TO BE GOOD.
HE IS TRYING TO SAVE HIS LIFE.
&gt;&gt; YES, HE IS. FINALLY, HE CHOCKS IT.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A
RESCUE? HE HAWKS IT OUT IN THE WOODS?
?
WHAT'S HE SUPPOSED TO DO? &gt;&gt; GET A BIGGER NET.
I THINK WE NEED TO FOLLOW
CONCUSSION PROCEDURES ON THAT</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt; STAND BY, EVERYONE, FOR THE
"RTM" iPAD MINI GIVEAWAY.
&gt;&gt;&gt; A GROUP OF HUNTERS IN ITALY WENT OUT AND SET UP THIS CAMERA
BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO CAPTURE
THIS STUNNING VIEW, BUT WHAT THEY ENDED UP CAPTURING WAS
SOMETHING THEY NEVER SAW COMING.
&gt;&gt; EARTHQUAKE. &gt;&gt; ITALY EXPERIENCED A
6.6-MAGNITUDE EARTHQUAKE OVER
THE WEEKEND, AND THESE HUNTERS WERE OUT IN THIS AREA EXPECTING
TO HAVE A WEEKEND OF HUNTING,
WHEN SUDDENLY THE EARTH BELOW THEM STARTED SHAKING.
&gt;&gt; THEORETICALLY, THIS IS THE
BEST PLACE TO BE. AT LEAST THEY ARE OUT THERE IN
THE COUNTRY, BUT IT GIVES YOU AN
IDEA OF THE KIND OF MOVEMENT HAPPENING.
&gt;&gt; THEY WERE WORRIED THIS WAS
GOING TO CAUSE MORE DEATHS, BECAUSE IF YOU REMEMBER, THEY'VE
BEEN HAVING MULTIPLE
EARTHQUAKES. THE ONE BACK IN AUGUST KILLED
300 PEOPLE.
FORTUNATELY, THIS ONE DID NOT. THIS VIDEO CAPTURED, ONE OF OUR
BUDDIES TOOK 24-YEAR-OLD
CHRISTOPHER OUT THERE WITH HIS DRONE TO CAPTURE THESE AMAZING
IMAGES AS THEY ALSO DESCEND INTO
THE MOUTH OF THIS CRATER. &gt;&gt; IT LOOKS LIKE THE EARTH HAS
HEART BURN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT
OPENING. OH, SOMEBODY THROW IN A PEPSI.
&gt;&gt; I REALLY LOVE THESE SHOTS OF
THEM DESCENDING INTO THE MOUTH OF THIS CRATER, WHICH IS WHERE
THEY ARE GOING TO BE CAMPING
OUT. YOU SEE THE CREW HERE SETTING UP
A TENT.
IT'S GOING TO BE WARM. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE COLD.
&gt;&gt; YEAH, PERMANENT CAMP FIRE.
&gt;&gt; DON'T WORRY, THEY WERE FINE, BUT THE IMAGES THAT THEY
CAPTURED OF THE LAVA BURNING,
BOILING IN THAT CRATER, IS SO STINKING MAGNIFICENT.
&gt;&gt; I CAN'T DECIDE, EITHER WAY,
I'M IMPRESSED.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; AROUND THE WORLD, POLICE
HAVE A BUSY JOB.
PAPERWORK AND CRIMINALS TO ARREST.
IN ROMANIA, THIS POLICE OFFICER
PULLED UP TO THE LOCAL ADMINISTRATION OFFICE.
HE'S GOT TO RUN IN THE BUILDING
AND DELIVER SOME OF HIS PAPERWORK, SO HE PARKS OUT FRONT
AND HEADS INSIDE.
FORGOT ONE VERY SMALL DETAIL. A DAY FULL OF DETAIL-ORIENTED
TASKS.
&gt;&gt; FORGOT TO SET THE BRAKE OR SOMETHING?
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT, GAYLE.
HIS POLICE CAR STARTS SLOWLY, THEN PICKS UP A LITTLE BIT MORE
MOMENTUM AS IT CROSSES THE
STREET RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE HORSE AND CART.
&gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME. &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY SEES IT, TRIES TO
STOP IT.
NO, CRASHES INTO THE DITCH. THAT'S WHEN THE OFFICER STARTS
RUNNING OUT.
&gt;&gt; WRITE YOURSELF A TICKET. &gt;&gt; EXACTLY.
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE IN VIOLATION.
&gt;&gt; MOMENTS LATER, FOLKS GET OUT OF THEIR CAR AND CART AND GATHER
AROUND TO HELP OFFICER FRIENDLY
PUSH HIS VEHICLE OUT OF THE DITCH.
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THERE WAS
SERIOUS DAMAGE. THIS VEHICLE IN THE LEFT HAND
LANE STARTS TO DRIFT OVER TO THE
RIGHT. RIGHT AFTER IT PASSES THIS
HIGHWAY ENTRANCE RAMP SIGN, DID
YOU SEE IT, 355 TO THE RIGHT. WELL, THAT CAR WASN'T QUITE
PAYING ATTENTION.
NOPE, THAT'S NOT -- NO. THAT'S NOT THE ENTRANCE RAMP.
IT WAS JUST PAST THE AREA WHERE
YOU JUST DROVE INTO A DITCH. &gt;&gt; WAS THIS PERSON ASLEEP OR
DRUNK OR WHAT?
&gt;&gt; WE DON'T KNOW THAT FOR SURE,</description>

      <description>WE HAVE NO IDEA WHETHER THIS
PERSON HAD OTHER ISSUES OR NOT.
&gt;&gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE A FAN OF THE DARK, SMALL SPACES, DEAD THINGS, THIS
MIGHT NOT BE THE VIDEO FOR YOU.
BECAUSE ALLISON, WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER HAD A DREAM --
&gt;&gt; ALWAYS DREAMED OF BEING
INDIANA JONES AND A SURFER. &gt;&gt; OPPORTUNITY TO BRING THOSE
DREAMS TOGETHER IS HERE, BECAUSE
SHE IS HEADING UNDERNEATH THE STREETS OF PARIS.
&gt;&gt; ALSO KNOWN AS THE WORLD'S
LARGEST GRAVE. &gt;&gt; SHE'S GOING TO SURF THE
CATACOMBS.
SHE'S HEADING BELOW THE STREETS INTO A 180-MILE MAZE OF TUNNELS
FILLED WITH 6 MILLION BODIES.
&gt;&gt; WHAT? &gt;&gt; I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS THAT
EXPANSIVE.
&gt;&gt; IN FACT, THEY SAY THERE'S THREE LEVELS OF THE CATACOMBS,
THE LOWEST ONES OF WHICH ARE
FILLED WITH WATER. &gt;&gt; HOT DOWN HERE.
REALLY HOT.
VERY SUFFOCATING. LUCKILY, I BROUGHT MY BIKINI.
&gt;&gt; SHE GRABS HER PINK BIKINI AND
SURF BOARD AND VERY ILLEGALLY UNDER THE GROUND.
&gt;&gt; ABOUT TO SURF IN THE
CATACOMBS SOMEWHERE. &gt;&gt; AS THEY START HEADING DEEP,
ALL PRETTY NORMAL, BRICKS ON THE
SIDES AND THINGS LIKE THAT. THEN IT'S A BIT INDIANA JONESY.
&gt;&gt; OH, MY GOSH.
LOOK AT ALL THESE BONES. &gt;&gt; DON'T GO IN THERE, DON'T WALK
ON THEM.
&gt;&gt; LEAVE THEM WHERE THEY ARE AT. RESPECT.
I'LL SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE.
&gt;&gt; NOW THEY ARE GETTING DEEP INTO THE CATACOMBS.
STARTS GETTING TIGHTER AND
TIGHTER. WHAT FOLLOWS IS A COUPLE OF
HOURS OF THIS.
&gt;&gt; THERE'S LITERALLY NO WAY OUT. MILLIONS OF HUMAN BONES.
&gt;&gt; AS SHE STARTS GETTING DEEPER,
YOU CAN SEE FINALLY THEY START FINDING SOME WATER.
WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME TO BUST
OUT THAT SURF BOARD AND BIKINI AND GET AWESOME SHOTS BY BEING
THE FIRST PERSON.
&gt;&gt; WHEN I SAY SURF, I BASICALLY MEAN RISK HYPOTHERMIA TO GET A
RAD SHOT OF ME PADDLING THROUGH
THE ANCIENT CATACOMBS. &gt;&gt; BUT TO GET OUT, THEY HADN'T
QUITE CALCULATED HOW DEEP THE
WATER WOULD GET. THEY DIDN'T EVENTUALLY FIND A
MANHOLE TO CRAWL OUT OF.
YOU KNOW WHAT, IF YOU WANT TO BE THE FIRST PERSON TO EVER SURF
THE CATACOMBS UNDER PARIS, YOU
HAVE TO TAKE RISKS.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN TO A
SHOW IN ATLANTA, YOU KNOW IT'S
ALL ABOUT STYLE. IT'S ALL ABOUT FASHION.
YOU GO BIG OR GO HOME.
IT'S ALL ABOUT FLAIR AND TECHNIQUE.
WELL, THIS INDIAN BARBER, HE
WON'T BE ANY TIME SOON. BUT HE IS ALL ABOUT THE FLAIR.
&gt;&gt; GET THAT THING AWAY FROM ME.
HE USES A CANDLE FLAME. &gt;&gt; TELL ME IT'S SINGED.
&gt;&gt; STINKS SO BAD.
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO DO THAT ALL DAY?
CUTS ALL OF HIS HAIR?
&gt;&gt; SEEMS THAT'S A UNIQUE TECHNIQUE.
TAKES A HANDLE, PUTS UP AGAINST
THE COMB, AND GOES BACK AND FORTH AS YOU CUT HAIR.
IT'S DRAWING ATTENTION AND FOLKS
ARE SITTING IN THE CHAIR TO ALLOW HIM TO DO IT.
THEY DON'T SEEM BOTHERED BY IT.
IN ADDITION TO HAVING THE FAKE HAIR IS, THERE'S OIL.
LOTS AND LOTS OF OIL.
&gt;&gt; EVER ACCIDENTLY BURNT YOUR HAIR BY BLOWING UP YOUR GRILL,
NEVER HAPPENED TO ME.
GETS BALLS ON THE END, NOT EXACTLY A SMOOTH CUT.
ISN'T IT GOING TO BE A PAIN?
&gt;&gt; DOESN'T YOUR HAIR GET WAXY, TOO, AFTER THIS?
&gt;&gt; MAYBE HIS MOM IS LIKE, YOU'RE
NOT ALLOWED TO USE SCISSORS. FINE, CANDLE!
&gt;&gt; DO THE HAIRCUTS LOOK GOOD
AFTERWARDS? THAT'S THE QUESTION.
&gt;&gt; AT THE END YOU SEE WHAT LOOKS
LIKE THE FINAL CUT, AND IT LOOKS LIKE ANY OTHER CUT WE'VE SEEN.
&gt;&gt; IT DOES, LOOKS LIKE THE OTHER
TWO IN THE SHOP. &gt;&gt; BLOW THAT WHOLE BUILDING
DOWN.
&gt;&gt; THE FAMOUS FERRARI ENGINE AND SOUND.
NO LONGER DOES IT HAVE TO STAY
IN A FERRARI. WHY NOT TAKE A ENGINE AND PUT IT
INSIDE A TOYOTA GT 86.
&gt;&gt; WHAT? &gt;&gt; YEAH.
THAT'S THE FAMOUS DRIFTER.
HE HANDLES CARS LIKE A SURGEON, BUT IF YOU'RE HEADED UP TO SEEMA
IN LAS VEGAS THIS WEEK, THE
AUTOMOTIVE TRADE SHOW, YOU MAY GET A CHANCE TO SEE THIS
FINISHED FERRARI.
&gt;&gt; IT'S A BEAUTIFUL SOUND, BUT IMAGINE BEING ON THE STREETS AND
HEAR THAT SOUND AND LOOKING
OVER. &gt;&gt; COMING UP NEXT TO A FERRARI
AND LAMBO AT THE LIGHTS AND
ABSOLUTELY SMASHING THEM. &gt;&gt; THIS THING IS GOING TO BE A
FIRE DESTROYER.
LOTS OF IMPRESSIVE ENGINEERING. IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE ENTIRE
BUILD, CHECK OUT THE DONUT MEDIA
YOUTUBE CHANNEL. SPEAKING OF ROASTING TIRES, IT'S
TIME TO BURN A COUPLE HERE FOR A
VERY GOOD REASON. EMILY AND TYLER ARE EXPECTING A
BABY, AND THE GENDER IS BENEATH
TYLER'S BELOVED MUSTANG. THE TIRE STARTS TO SMOKE.
THEIR BUDDY IS FLYING A DRONE
OVERHEAD. WHAT'S IT GOING TO BE?
IT'S A GIRL.
ONCE THE SMOKE CLEARS, HERE'S THE REALLY COOL PART, THE
GRANDPARENTS ARE THERE NEARBY.
THE SMOKE DISSIPATES A BIT AND YOU SEE ONE OF THE GRANDMAS
RUNNING UP, YOU SEE EXACTLY WHAT
SHE'S GOING TO BE SNUGGLING WITH.

      <description>ADVANCE TO MAKE SURE THEY CAN
MAKE IT.
JUSTIN AND GEORGE PLANNED THEIR WEDDING, BUT THEY DIDN'T TELL
ANYBODY.
IN FACT, ALL OF THEIR GUESTS THOUGHT THEY WERE SHOWING UP TO
THEIR ENGAGEMENT PARTY.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO, BECAUSE THAT WAY NOBODY CAN PUT
IN THEIR TWO CENTS AND GET MAD.
THEY AREUST HAPPY THEY GOT INVITED.
&gt;&gt; YOU THINK, EXCEPT YOU DO HAVE
A PROBLEM, BECAUSE IT'S JUST THE ENGAGEMENT PARTY.
&gt;&gt; SO MANY PEOPLE, LIKE, OH, WE
GOT FOOTBALL TICKETS THAT DAY. WE'LL JUST BLOW THAT OFF.
&gt;&gt; AS A MATTER OF FACT, BEST
FRIENDS HAD TICKETS TO THE RAIDERS THAT DAY AND SAID I'M
GOING TO GO SEE THE GAME.
I WILL SEE YOU LATER, MY FRIEND. &gt;&gt; ESPECIALLY THE DUDES.
ENGAGEMENT PARTY?
WE'LL GO TO THE GAME. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF THAT, THEY HAD TO
FESS UP TO SOME OF THEIR PEOPLE,
SO GEORGE HAS TO REVEAL TO HIS FRIEND THAT IT'S ACTUALLY THE
WEDDING, BUT SHHH!
SO THE FRIEND ENDED UP COMING TO THIS SURPRISE WEDDING DAY.
MOST OF THEIR GUESTS FOUND OUT
ON THE SPOT WITH THE CAR THAT SAYS, SURPRISE, WE'RE GETTING
MARRIED TODAY.
SHE HAD TO CONVINCE HER GIRLFRIEND NOT TO GO OUT AND RUN
ERRANDS THAT MORNING SO SHE
COULD HELP HER DO HER MAKEUP AND GET READY FOR THE WEDDING.
&gt;&gt; ALMOST SEEMED IT WAS MORE
EFFORT TO TRY TO CONVINCE PEOPLE TO COME AND NOT MISS IT.
WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THEIR
SURPRISE WEDDING?</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt; Gene: IN WASHINGTON WITH
CRITICISM FROM DEMOCRATS,
REPUBLICANS AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THIS FBI
ANNOUNCEMENT SO CLOSE TO ELECTION DAY SHAKING THINGS OFF.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS AN UNPRECEDENTED MOVE
AS FOLKS WERE DESCRIBING EARLIER BECAUSE IT HAPPENS CLOSE TO
ELECTION WHICH IS IN VIOLATION
OF NORMAL JUSTICE DEPARTMENT PROTOCOL AND INVOLVES TALKING
ABOUT ONGOING INVESTIGATION
WHICH ALSO VIOLATES THE PROTOCOL.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: ADDITIONAL
E-MAILS RELEVANT TO CLINTON PRIVATE E-MAIL SERVER PREVIOUSLY
TOLD CONGRESS WAS CLOSED AND
LAWMAKER ON BOTH SIDE DEMANDED MORE INFORMATION FROM THE
AGENCY.
THE TOP REPUBLICAN ON JUDICIARY ECONOMY SAYS CONGRESS DESERVES
MORE CONTEXT TO PROPERLY ASSESS
WHAT THEY PLAN TO DO WITH IT AND DIRECTOR MAY HAVE VIOLATED THE
HATCH ACT WHICH PROHIBITS FBI
OFFICIAL FROM USING THE POSITION TO INFLUENCE ELECTIONS.
MEANWHILE THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS
PRAISING THE LEADERSHIP. &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE SINGLE BIGGEST
SCANDAL SINCE WATERGATE.
&gt;&gt; ADDITIONAL E-MAILS FOUND AS PART OF UNRELATED INVESTIGATION
INTO FORMER CONGRESSMAN ANTHONY
WEINER AND ALSO ESTRANGED HUSBAND OF TOP CLINTON AIDE HUMA

BOTH PICTURES ARE INAPPROPRIATE.
&gt;&gt; IN UNIFORM AND SHOULDN'T BE MAKING POLITICAL STATEMENTS.
&gt;&gt; IT IS A LITTLE CRAZY.
&gt;&gt; PRESIDENT OF THE MEDFORD PATROLMAN'S ASSOCIATION.
HE SAYS THE PICTURES WERE MEANT
TO BE A JOKE AND DELETED THE POST BECAUSE OF THE PUBLIC
REACTION AND CHECK WITH THE
STATE ETHICS COMMISSION WEBSITE AND ALL EMPLOYEES NOT TO ENGAGE
IN ANY POLITICAL ACTIVITY.
&gt;&gt; Sara: DRIVER CHARGED WITH OUI AND RECKLESS ENDANGERMENT OF
CHILD.

LEONARDO SIX-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER
WAS IN THE CAR AND TRACTOR-TRAILER DRIVER SAYS AT
FIRST HE HAD NO IDEA WHAT
HAPPENED. &gt;&gt; I HEAR THIS BOOM SO I THOUGHT
I BLEW A TIRE BUT AS I LOOKED
THROUGH MY REAR VIEW MIRROR DRIVING A CAR.
&gt;&gt; HE ADMITTED TO USING HEROIN
AND COCAINE IN THE CAR COUPLE HOURS BEFORE THE CRASH.
&gt;&gt; GOODIE BAGS DELIVERED TO
PRINCIPALS IN HOPES THAT HALLOWEEN TREATS WILL HELP LIFT
KIDS SPIRITS BUT NOT EVERYONE
WILL BE CELEBRATING GOING BACK TO SCHOOL AND FORCED TO START
OVER SOMEWHERE NEW.
&gt;&gt; 12-YEAR-OLD HAVERHILL BOY CELEBRATING HALLOWEEN IN STYLE.
EVERY YEAR DAD BUILDS HIM CUSTOM
COSTUME. HIS WHEELCHAIR HAS BEEN
TRANSFORMED INTO X WING FROM

      <description>MORNING.
WE HAVE BEEN WARNING YOU FOR
WEEKS TO REMOVE CONSTRUCTION AT TOLL BOOTHS AND THAT HAS BEGUN.
TEAM OF REPORTERS COVERING THE
BACKUP. DANIEL MILLER LIVE AT ROADS,
MICHAEL HENRICH HAS LIVE LOOK AT
WORK TO REMOVE THE WESTON TOLLS. &gt;&gt; Sara: WE WANT TO BEGIN WITH
JULIE GRAUERT WHO'S LIVE ABOVE
TRAFFIC. WHAT ARE YOU SEEING, JULIE?
&gt;&gt; Julie: GOOD MORNING,
EVERYONE, YES, WE ARE HERE IN SKY FOX ABOVE THE WESTON TOLLS.
PLEASE EXCUSE ME SCARY VOICE.
I'M NURSING A COLD. THINGS NOT TOO SCARY, AT LEAST
FROM OUR ADVANTAGE POINT RIGHT
NOW. WHAT WE CAN SEE IS TON OF WORK
BEING DONE ACTUALLY, WORK TAKE
THE TOLLS DOWN AND AREN'T SEEING THOSE GIANT TOLL BOOTHS.
LOOK LIKE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS
OVER THE WEEKEND. A LOT OF CREWS OUT HERE,
FLASHING LIGHTS MAKE SURE
DRIVERS ARE READY AND NOWHERE TO GO ON THE DETOURS AND 7:00-HOUR,
OF COURSE, EXPECTING TO SLOWDOWN
MORE BUT PICTURES FROM SKY FOX AND A LOT OF SPACE BETWEEN THE
CARS.
AND PARKING LOT OUT HERE YET AND MORNING IS YOUNG AND WE WILL BE
CONTINUING TO FOLLOW THIS AS I
NURSE HOT TEA OVER HERE AND GET BACK TO CATHERINE PARROTTA WHO'S
WATCHING TROUBLED SPOTS ON THE
ROAD. CATHERINE?
&gt;&gt; Catherine: LET'S TAKE LOOK
AT DRIVE TIMES FOR YOU RIGHT NOW.
PIKE FROM 495 TO THE WESTON
TOLLS, GOING TO TAKE BUT 25 MINUTES.
PIKE FROM THE WESTON TOLLS, TED
WILLIAMS TUNNEL ABOUT 16 MINUTES.
AVERAGING OKAY SPEEDS IN BOTH OF
THE STRETCHES AS WELL. THE EXPRESSWAY, OF COURSE, FROM
THE SPLIT TO THE PIKE, THAT'S
THE SLOW SPOT, JUST ABOUT HALF HOUR THERE.
&gt;&gt; Gene: ON THE GROUND THINGS
SLOWING DOWN THROUGH THE TOLL PLAZA.
MICHAEL HENRICH NOW AT THE
WESTON TOLLS RIGHT NOW WITH LOOK AT PROGRESS.
I GUESS WE CAN'T SAY TOLL PLAZA
ANY MORE EITHER, MICHAEL, CAN WE?
&gt;&gt; Michael: I'M TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT WHERE I AM. IT IS NOT THE WESTON TOLLS ANY
MORE.
IT IS THE WESTON ARTIST FORMERLY KNOWN AS TOLLS.
I DON'T KNOW.
THEY ARE NOT TAKING YOUR MONEY ANY MORE AND LARGE CONSTRUCTION
AREA IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
INTERCHANGE BETWEEN THE PIKE AND OBVIOUSLY WE ARE RIGHT BY THE
128 AND ROUTE 30.
THIS WEEKEND STARTING FRIDAY NIGHT WHEN ELECTRONIC TOLLING
SYSTEM TOOK OVER COLLECTING YOUR
MONEY, CREWS WENT TO WORK RIGHT AWAY AND ACTUALLY A LITTLE AHEAD
OF SCHEDULE.
THEY ARE PULLING DOWN THE CENTER LANE TOLLBOOTH AT THIS POINT AND
THEY ARE EVEN FILLING IN, THERE
WAS A TUNNEL UNDERNEATH HIM, FILLING THAT IN, THEY ARE
REPAVING THE ROADWAYS, GETTING
THOSE CENTER LANES READY TO TAKE OVER THE BULK OF THE TRAFFIC
WHICH WON'T BE FOR ANOTHER FEW
WEEKS. THEY ARE WORKING HARD TO GET
THINGS DONE.
THAT'S PUSHING ALL THE TRAFFIC TO THE SIDE ROADS.
THAT'S WHY WE ARE SEEING THE
DIFFERENT TRAFFIC PATTERNS JULIE WAS MENTIONING FROM ABOVE IN SKY
FOX AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE SEEING
FOLKS SLOWING DOWN MORE THAN USUAL TO WHAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE
15 MILES PER HOUR.
I WON'T LIE TO YOU AND SAY EVERYBODY IS GOING 15 MILES PER
HOUR BUT WE ARE SEEING A
SLOWDOWN HERE AS PEOPLE TRY TO COPE WITH DIFFERENT TRAFFIC
PATTERNS AND STILL PHYSICALLY
HAVING TO GO THROUGH THE TOLLBOOTH EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE
NOT COLLECTING YOUR MONEY.
1. I WANT TO GET OUT THERE, WE HAVE BEEN MENTIONING IT
THROUGHOUT OUR COVERAGE OVER THE
LAST SEVERAL WEEKS, EVEN IF DON'T HAVE EZ PASS WE WILL GET
ON THE PIKE TODAY AND FOREVER,
REALLY, 16 THROUGHOUT THE PIKE, THEY WILL TAKE A PICTURE OF
LICENSE PLATE AND CHARGE A BILL.
CHARGE YOU MORE THAN IF YOU ARE HAVING THE EZ PASS AND THEY ARE
HAVING A GRACE PERIOD FOR SIX
MONTHS. IF YOU GET A BILL IN THE MAIL BY
PAY BY PLATE AND APPLY FOR EZ
PASS YOU WILL GET A CREDIT FOR THE DIFFERENCE IN THOSE TWO
TOLLING FEES ON YOUR BILL AND
NEW EZ PASS IF YOU CHOOSE TO GO THAT ROUTE.
WE WILL KEEP AN EYE ON IT AND
I'M SURE IT WILL PICK UP IN THE NEXT SEVERAL MINUTES AND WE
EXPECT A SIGNIFICANT SLOWDOWN AS
THE MORNING PROGRESSES. FOR NOW LIVE IN WESTON, MICHAEL
HENRICH, FOX25 NEWS.
&gt;&gt; Sara: TO GIVE YOU BETTER IDEA WHAT DRIVERS ARE GOING
THROUGH, DANIEL MILLER IS OUT
AND CONKEY ON -- COVERAGE ON THE WESTON TOLLS.
SLOWING DOWN A BIT.
&gt;&gt; Daniel: ACTUALLY JUST PASSED THE WESTON TOLLS WHERE
MICHAEL HENRICH IS SET UP LIVE
THERE AND GOING THROUGH THE TOLL WAS VERY SMOOTH PROCESS AND
HEATED TOWARD THE
ALLSTON-BRIGHTON TOLLS AND BROUGHT TO YOU FROM THE CAR,
TRAFFIC STILL MOVING SLOW, SPEED
LIMB KNIT PLACE RIGHT NOW IS 15 MILES PER HOUR AND REASON FOR
THAT MassDOT OFFICIALS WANT
PEOPLE TO GO TO THE SPEED BECAUSE OF THE DEMOLITION WORK
THAT'S TAKING PLACE THERE.
ALSO TRAFFIC PATTERNS THAT HAVE CHANGED THAT ARE OUT BECAUSE OF
THE CHANGING IN NEW ELECTRONIC
TOLLING SYSTEM THAT IS UP AND RUNNING RIGHT NOW.
YOU COULD SEE FROM THE PICTURE
YOU WANT TO GIVE YOURSELF SOME EXTRA TIME TO GET TO WORK OR TO
YOUR DESTINATION WHEREVER YOU'RE
GOING BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE NOT USED TO THE CHANGE IN
THE SYSTEM AND MassDOT
OFFICIAL PREPARED US FOR AND SAY EXPECT THE NORMAL DRIVE TIME TO
BE MUCH LONGER.
THIS IS EXACT WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT AND WE WILL BE
HERE IN THE CAR RIDING WITH YOU
AND GIVING YOU A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE WHAT IT IS LIKE TO
GET THROUGH THE MASS PIKE WITH
THETOLOGY SYSTEM AND THE CHANGE THAT'S IN PLACE.
, OF COURSE, WE WILL BRING IT TO
YOU ALL MORNING AND LIVE AT WE BE WEB.

&gt;&gt; THEY TRIED TO SUBDUE THE INDIVIDUAL ALSO WITHOUT USING
FORCE BUT HE WAS ABLE TO KEEP

      <description>&gt;&gt; Gene: WEEKLONG HUNT FOR
OKLAHOMA MAN IS NOW OVER.
HE DIED IN SHOOTOUT LAST NIGHT. HE ALLEGEDLY SHOT A SHERIFF WHEN
CAR WAS PULLED OVER YESTERDAY.
HE ESCAPED AND WAS PULLED OVER AGAIN AND THAT'S WHEN DEADLY GUN
FIRE WAS EXCHANGED.
HE WAS ACCUSED OF KILLING TWO OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS AND BRAGGING
ABOUT THE ALLEGED CRIMES ON
FACEBOOK. &gt;&gt; Gene: TERRIFYING MOMENT A
MAN TOOK OUT MACHETE AT NEW
ORLEANS AIRPORT. INCIDENT HAPPENED IN MARCH OF
LAST YEAR.
RICHARD WHITE CAN BE SWINGING BLADE AT OTHER PASSENGERS BEFORE
CHASING TSA WORKER THROUGH
CHECKPOINT. INVESTIGATORS SAID HE HID
MACHETE IN BAG THAT CONTAINED
SIX MOLOTOV COCKTAILS. HE DIED FROM GUNSHOT WOUND HE
RECEIVED DURING THE ATTACK.
&gt;&gt; Sara: YESTERDAY OUTSIDE MARTINSVILLE SPEEDWAY AND BLEW
INTO CROWD INJURING 22 PEOPLE.
13 PEOPLE WERE TREATED FOR MINOR INJURIES AND NO WORD ON
CONDITION OF THE OTHER NINE.
POLICE SAY THEY DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ALCOHOL WAS A FACTOR IN THE
CRASH.
&gt;&gt; Gene: DON'T POKE A SLEEPING BAR.
ZOO EXHIBIT WAKING UP A SLEETING
PANDA. WHY DID HE DO THIS?
OLDEST REASON ON THE PLANET TO
IMPRESS A GIRL. THEN PANDA WRESTLE SAME WAY WITH
THE BREEDERS AND MAN MANAGED
ESCAPE WITH PANTS AND DIGNITY TORN.
&gt;&gt; Sara: FLORIDA BOY GOT
UNEXPECTED TREAT WHEN SURPRISED BY HIS DAD.
&gt;&gt; I WAS GOING TO PICK HIM UP
DURING TRICK OR TREATING BUT TURNED OUT TO BE MORE.
&gt;&gt; HE WAS ALL SMILES WHEN FATHER
AND AIR FORCE STAFF SERGEANT SHOWED UP IN GAINESVILLE CROWD
THURSDAY.
FOUR-YEAR-OLD WAS EASY TO SPOT AND CHOSE DRESS-UP TO DRESS UP
IN UNIFORMS THIS YEAR JUST LIKE
HIS DAD. JERMAINE HAYES HAS BEEN DEPLOYED
FOR EIGHT MONTHS AND SO HAPPY TO
GET BACK IN TIME TO GET TRICK OR TREATING.
I COULD WATCH THE VIDEO OVER AND
OVER AGAIN. WIND CHILL 45Â° AND HOW IT FEELS
IN YOUR TOWN AND WHEN THINGS

      <description>THE BIG STORY ON THE -- FIRST
MONDAY MORNING FOR THAT MATTER
OF THE COMMUTE AS THE STATE BEGINS TEARING DOWN THE TOLL
BOOTHS.
&gt;&gt; Sara:  TEAM COVERAGE TO GET TO WORK AND SCHOOL ON TIME.
CATHERINE PARROTTA IS UPDATING
LIVE DRIVE TIMES FOR US. FOX25'S MICHAEL HENRICH LIVE AT
THE WESTON TOLLS.
AT FIRST WE START WITH JEWEL SQULUL IS IN SKYFOX FOR US THIS
MORNING.
JULIE, YOUR VOICE IS A LITTLE BIT HOARSE THIS MORNING AND YOU
ARE GETTING THROUGH IT.
&gt;&gt; A LITTLE HEAVIER VOLUME THAN USUAL BACKING UP AS YOU
APPROACH THE TOLL AREA --
EXCUSE MY VOICE, A LITTLE SCARY AS I NURSE THE COLD, NOT QUITE
AS SCARY AS I ANTICIPATE THE
TRAFFIC TO BECOME. AGAIN TAKE TO YOU LIVE PICTURES
AND SHOW YOU WHAT WE ARE SEEING
FROM SKYFOX RIGHT NOW. WHICH A LOT OF WORK FROM THE
CREWS OUT THERE, THE
CONSTRUCTION CREWS AND THE DEMOLITION CREWS.
WE ALSO HAVE FLASHING LIGHTS
FROM POLICEMEN. THERE ARE INCREASED PATROLS.
AND THE SPEED LIMIT HAS BEEN
REDUCED TO 15 MILES PER HOUR. BESIDE REDUCED LANE BECAUSE OF
THE CONSTRUCTION, DOWN TO THE
BRAKES AND TAKING IT REAL SLOW IN THERE.
AND AS YOU CAN SEE IN THESE
LIVE PICTURE, NOT A HUGE BACKUP YET.
STILL EARLY.
HITTING 6:3  AND WE WILL CHECK BACK WITH YOU IN ABOUT A HALF
AN HOUR AND I EXPECT FOR THINGS
TO LOOK DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT. BACK TO YOU, GENE AND SARA.
&gt;&gt; Gene:  TAKE CARE OF THAT
VOICE. SHE IS TOUGHING IT OUT FOR US
GIVES US A BIRDS-EYE VIEW ON
THE PIKE. IN TERMS OF WHAT IS HAPPENING
ON THE GROUND, MICHAEL HENRICH
HAS BEEN OUT FOR A CUP OF HOURS.
HOW HAVE THINGS CHANGED FROM
THE RECENT TIME SPAN SINCE YOU HAVE BEEN THERE?
&gt;&gt; Reporter: WE ARE DEFINITELY
SEEING A LOT MORE VOLUME OVER THE LAST 30 MINUTES AND THAT IS
GOING TO INCREASE AS JULIE SAID
AND IT WILL BE LOUD ENOUGH FOR BOTH OF US SO JULIE CAN REST
YOUR VOICE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE
OF MINUTES. AND A LOOK BEHIND ME, A FEEL
FROM THE TRAFFIC PATTERN THAT
WILL LOOK DIFFERENT THAN WHAT COMMUTERS ARE USED TO BECAUSE
OF ALL ELECTRONIC TOLLING
SWITCH OVER. THE TOLL BOOTHS IN THESE
SIDE LANES.
THEY ARE NOT ACTIVE ANYMORE. THERE ARE NO CASH LANES.
NOBODY IS IN THEM.
YOU ARE EXPECTED TO DRIVE RIGHT THROUGH.
THE CENTER TOLL BOOTH, A LOT OF
PROGRESS ALREADY KNOCKING THEM DOWN AND THE CONSTRUCTION CREWS
ARE DOING WHAT THEY CAN AROUND
THE CLOCK TO CLEAR THE DEBRIS, REPAVE THE ROADS, AND YOU EVEN
SEE SOME STATE TROOPER IN THE
CENTER. WE SHOWED YOU EARLIER.
THEY WERE WAVING PEOPLE THROUGH
BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE USED TO STOPPING IN THOSE TOLL
BOOTHS, AND THAT WILL FURTHER
SLOW DOWN THE TRAFFIC FLOW. THEY HAVE BEEN WAVING THEM ON
PERIODICALLY OVER THE LAST HOUR
OR SO. THE KEY HERE IS THAT PEOPLE
NEED TO BE AWARE THAT THESE ARE
WORK ZONES. MASS DOT ESTIMATES 23 WORK
ZONES ALONG THE PIKE HERE IN
MASSACHUSETTS FROM END TO END. EVERY DRIVER ON THE PIKE WILL
SEE ONE OF THESE CREWS HERE.
EVERY DRIVER NEEDS TO BE CAREFUL TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU
GO HOME SAFELY AND THAT
EVERYONE ON THE ROAD GETS TO WORK SAFELY.
AS YOU WILL HEAR JULIE OONLD ME
SAY FOR NOW SLOW AND STEADY BUT.
THAT COULD CHANGE AS MORE CARS
HIT THE MASS PIKE. &gt;&gt; Gene:  WE ARE UPDATING THE
DRIVE TIMES.
CATHERINE PARROTTA IS BREAKING THAT DOWN WITH LIVE DRIVE-TIME
TRAFFIC.
&gt;&gt; Catherine:  KEEPING AN EYE ON ALL THE SPOTS.
THE EXPRESSWAY SLOW, COMING
DOWN 93. YOU SEE HER JAMMED UP IN
SOMERVILLE, MEDFORD.
SLOW AS YOU APPROACH BURLINGTON.
24 MILES PER HOUR.
GIVING A LOOK AT THE PIKE. YOU ARE SLOW ALL THE WAY PAST
FRAMINGHAM AS YOU HEAD
EASTBOUND. YOU ARE AVERAGE BEING 36 MILES
PER HOUR THERE AND REALLY
GETTING SLOW IN A CUP OF POCKETS.
OF COURSE YOU SAW THAT AERIAL
VIEW FROM JULIE. ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE.
THIS IS OUR CHOPPER OVER THE
WESTON TOLLS HERE. AND YOU CAN SEE TRAFFIC MOVING
OKAY THROUGH THAT SPOT, BUT,
AGAIN, SOMETHING WE ARE KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON THIS MORNING AND
A LOOK AT THOSE DRIVE TIMES.
PIKE, 33 MINUTES. ROUTE 16 FROM WELLESLEY AFTER
THE PIKE WILL TAKE BUT 10
MINUTES IN THAT SPOT.</description>

      <description>TRICK OR TREATERS TONIGHT
COMING UP IN FIVE MINUTES.
&gt;&gt;&gt; THE COMMUTE ON THE PIKE IS EXPECTED TO BE A ROUGH ONE.
A LOOK AT THE PIKE IN WESTON.
YOU CAN SEE THE CONSTRUCTION TEAM IT OUT THERE.
A BUSY WEEKEND OF DEMOLITION ON
THE TOLL BOOTH AND A NEW OVERHEAD SYSTEM WENT ONLINE.
THE MORNING DRIVE EXPECTED TO
BE SLOW ESPECIALLY ON THE PIKE. RIGHT NOW THINGS ARE MOVING
ALONG OKAY AS WE LOOK AT
WESTON. OUR DANIEL MILLER IS ON THE
PIKE.
HOW WAS THE DRIVE GOING FOR YOU THIS MORNING?
&gt;&gt; Daniel:  GENE, GOOD MORNING.
TRAFFIC IS STARTING TO PICK UP PAST THE NATICK TOLL PLAZA THAT
THEY ARE DEMOLISHING RIGHT NOW.
DEFINITELY IN THE PAST HALF HOUR, TRAFFIC STARTING TO
PICKUP ON THE PIKE.
WE ARE HEADED EASTBOUND TOWARD THE ALSTON-BRIGHTON TOLLS.
WE WILL GO OUT ON THE PIKE TO
SEE THE DIFFERENCE OF WHAT WE SHOWED YOU AT THE TOP OF THE
HOUR.
YOU CAN SEE VEHICLES BUMPER-TO-BUMPER NOW AS WE GET
OFF TO GET ON TO THE PIKE.
THIS WAS A MUCH DIFFERENT PICTURE THAN WHAT WE SHOWED YOU
AT THE TOP OF THE HOUR.
THE TRAFFIC HERE AS WE EXIT ON TO THE MASS PIKE.
THERE IS A 15-MILE-PER-HOUR
SPEED LIMIT IN PLACE AS THE VEHICLES PASS THROUGH THESE
TOLL -- TOLL PLAZAS THIS
MORNING, AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THESE DEMOLITION CREWS
ARE OUT DEMOLISHING THE TOLL
BOOTHS AND THEY ARE ALSO TRAFFIC PATTERNS THAT ARE ALSO
IN PLACE AS FOLKS GET READY TO
EXPERIENCE THIS NEW ELECTRONIC TOLLING SYSTEM IN PLACE.
OF COURSE, WE ARE GOING TO BE
OUT HERE ALL MORNING GIVING YOU THIS DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE FROM
INSIDE THE CAR TO GIVE YOU WHAT
MOTORISTS ARE ACTUALLY GOING THROUGH AS THEY GET TO WORK
THIS MORNING.
OF COURSE, WE ARE JUST GETTING STARTED, AND WE HAVE SEVERAL
HOURS TO GO BEFORE THE MORNING
RUSH IS OVER. SO, OF COURSE, WE WILL BRING IT
TO YOU HERE LIVE.
REPORTING LIVE ON THE MASS PIKE THIS MONDAY MORNING.
I AM DANIEL MILLER, FOX25 NEWS.
&gt;&gt; Gene:  DANIEL, THANK YOU. THE FIRST BACKUP WE HAVE SEEN
THIS MORNING AND WE WILL BE
UPDATING THE DRIVE TIMES ON THE PIKE AND MAJOR ROADWAYS.
LIVE LOOK AT SKYFOX.
JULIE GRAUERT IN SKYFOX AND WILL BE KEEPING US UP TO DATE
FROM ALL OF THE DEVELOPMENTS
FROM THE AIR ON THE MASS PIKE. THE VOLUME STARTING TO INCREASE
AND SLOWDOWNS ARE PICKING UP AS
WELL AND AS MENTIONED CATHERINE PARROTTA WILL HAVE OUR LIVE
DRIVE TIMES COMING UP IN LESS
THAN FIVE MINUTES.</description>

      <description>INTO SCHOOL AND WORK.
AND ON THE PIKE AND MAJOR
ROADWAYS. MICHAEL HENRICH IS IN THE TOLLS
AND FOR NEWS WESTON.
DANIEL MILLER IS DRIVING AROUND BEHIND THE WHEEL.
BUT FIRST WE START WITH FOX25'S
JULIE GRAUERT. SHE IS LIVE IN SKYFOX FOR NEWS
MORNING WITH A BIRDS-EYE VIEW.
JULIE, GOOD MORNING. [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Julie:  GOOD MORNING,
EVERYONE, WE ARE LIVE ABOVE THE WESTON TOLLS.
EVERYBODY WANTS TO KNOW HOW
THINGS ARE GOING TO UNFOLD ON OUR FIRST REAL OFFICIAL MORNING
COMMUTE.
THE WESTON TOLLS WILL BE COME DOWN AND ALL OF THE REST OF THE
TOLLS ON THE PIKE.
YOU CAN SEE FROM THESE LIVE PICTURES, FLASHING LIGHTS OUT
THERE RIGHT NOW.
VOLUME IS LIGHT. I DON'T EXPECT IT TO PICK UP
UNTIL 6:30ISH ANYWAY, BUT WHEN
THEY DO PICK UP, NOW WE HAVE THOSE CENTER LANES ARE THAT ARE
CLOGGED UP.
15-MILE-PER-HOUR SPEED LIMITS IN AND PEOPLE DRIVING AN
UNOFFICIAL.
DON'T STOP AT THE BOOTH. JUST KEEP GOING AND WE WILL BE
WATCHING THIS ARE FOR YOU ALL
MORNING AND YOU CAN SEE FROM THESE LIVE PICTURES FROM SKYFOX
RIGHT NOW, THINGS ARE LOOKING
GOOD. BUT IT IS EARLY.
AND WE WILL BE CHECKING IN WITH
YOU ALL MORNING. BACK TO YOU.
&gt;&gt; Sara:  ALL RIGHT, JULIE.
OUR TEAM COVERAGE CONTINUES WITH THE WESTON TOLLS.
MICHAEL HENRICH HAS BEEN OUT
THERE SINCE 4:30 WHEN IT WAS PRETTY QUIET YET.
HAS IT CHANGED MUCH, MICHAEL?
&gt;&gt; Reporter: FROM THE GROUND IT IS PICKING UP AND A
15-MILE-PER-HOUR SPEED LIMIT IN
PLACE. ONE OF THE THE REASONS, THE
REMAINING TOLLS HERE.
YOU CAN SEE AN OFFICER STANDING THERE IN THE NOW DEFUNCT TOLL
BOOTH AREA WAVING PEOPLE ON.
NO ONE IN THE BOOTH. YOU CAN'T PAY THE TOLL.
KEEP MOVING.
THAT THE SES SAGE THAT THE PARTICULAR OFFICER AND MASS DOT
SYSTEM IS GIVING DRIVERS THIS
MORNING LETTING THEM KNOW THEY NEED TO KEEP ON GOING.
THE GANTRIES PART OF THAT ALL
ELECTRONIC TOLLING SYSTEM WENT LIFE.
YOU CAN PAY BY E-ZPASS OR BY
PLATE AND GET A BILL IN THE MAIL LATER ON FOR THE TOLLS.
THESE TOLL BOOTHS ARE NO LONGER
IN SERVICE. YOU ALSO HAD AN AERIAL VIEW OF
WHAT WE ARE SHOWING YOU NOW ON
THE GROUND. THE ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION CREWS
WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK TO GET
THE CENTER TOLL BOOTH DOWN AND OUT OF THE WAY.
REASON THIS IS NOT A SUBTLE
PROCESS TUNNELS UNDERNEATH THE TOLL BOOTH.
A LOT OF REPAVING THAT NEEDS TO
GO ON. THE ENTIRE CONFIGURATION WILL
TAKES WEEKS.
THIS JUST DAY ONE. AS THE TRAFFIC VOLUME CONTINUES
TO INCREASE THROUGHOUT THE
MORNING. WE ARE GOING TO SEE MORE AND
MORE BACKUPS.
AS JULIE MENTIONED IT IS GOING SMOOTHLY AND WE DO ANTICIPATE
THAT WILL STOP BEING THE CASE
PRETTY SOON. SO IF OFF DIFFERENT WAY TO GET
TO WORK TAKING THE MBTA
COMMUTER RAIL FOR THESE FOLKS HERE OR A BETTER WAY TO GET TO
WORK AVOID THE PIKE.
WE RECOMMEND DO YOU SO.</description>

      <description>FOR NOW LIVE THIS WESTON,
MICHAEL HENRICH, FOX25 NEWS.
&gt;&gt;&gt; WE CONTINUE OUR TEAM COVERAGE WITH DANIEL MILLER ON
THE ROADS GIVING US A LOOK FROM
BEHIND THE WHEEL AND DANIEL, WE ARE EXPECTING A TOUGH COMMUTE
THIS MORNING BUT DO YOU NOTICE
VOLUME INCREASING FROM WHERE YOU ARE RIGHT NOW?
&gt;&gt; Daniel:  GENE, WE ARE
STARTING TO NOTICE THE VOLUME INCREASING.
THE ALSTON-BRIGHTON TOLLS.
TRAFFIC TRYING TO GET THROUGH THE TOLLS BUT AS YOU SEE,
PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO BREAK.
WE DO HAVE A LOT OF TRAFFIC PICKING UP IN THE 6:00 HOUR,
BUT WE ARE GOING TO SEE FROM
THIS LIVE PICTURE HOW PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GO THROUGH THE
TOLL BOOTHS THAT ARE BEING IN
THE PROCESS OF BEING TORN DOWN RIGHT NOW.
YOU CAN SEE ON THE LEFT SIDE OF
INJURE SCREEN HERE. THE DRIVE SO FAR THIS MORNING
NOT BAD.
I AM ACTUALLY SURPRISED TO SEE THAT TRAFFIC IS MOVING SMOOTHLY
AS IT IS CONSIDERING MASS DOT
OFFICIALS HAVE EXPECTED TO HAPPEN THIS MORNING AND, OF
COURSE, THE MORNING COMMUTE
HERE CAN TAKE SEVERAL HOURS FROM PEOPLE.
WE JUST WENT THROUGHOUT TOLLS.
WE HAVE TO WORK THE CITY AND SEE WHAT IT WAS LIKE BUT THIS
MORNING, YOU WANT TO GIVE
YOURSELF EXTRA TIME, BUT YOU ARE DEFINITELY GOING TO TAKE
THE PIKE THIS MORNING BECAUSE
OFFICIALS SAY IT COULD BE MUCH LONGER.
OF COURSE, WE WILL SHOW YOU
THIS PERSPECTIVE FROM BEHIND THE CAR AND WE WILL BE WITH YOU
THROUGHOUT THE MORNING DRIVE.
REPORTING LIVE ON THE MASS PIKE THIS MORNING, DANIEL MILLER,
FOX25 NEWS.
&gt;&gt; Gene:  NICE TO SEE DANIEL GOING BY.
SEE YOU THERE.
THE PIKE SO FAR SO GOOD. UPDATE THE DRIVE TIMES.
CATHERINE PARROTTA IS BREAKING
THAT WITH LIVE DRIVE-TIME TRAFFIC.
&gt;&gt; Catherine:  CHECKING OTHER
SPOTS. THE EXPRESSWAY VERY SLOW
AVERAGING 25 MILES PER HOUR
THERE AS YOU GO BETWEEN QUINCY AND BOSTON.
AND UP HERE, STILL DEALING WITH
THE STALLED VEHICLE ON ME HOW THAT GOING OUT SAT 28 MILES PER
HOUR.
THAT STRETCH AS YOU MAKE YOUR WAY SOUTH.
LOOK AT THE PIKE IN THE WESTON
AREA. THIS INCIDENT REPORT ON THE MAP
BECAUSE THIS IS THE TOLL
DECONSTRUCTION WORK THAT IS GOING ON HERE THAT MICHAEL
HENRICH TOLD YOU ABOUT.
NO DELAYS AROUND IT JUST YET. WE ARE KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON
IT AS WE JUST SAW.
SKYFOX OVER THE PIKE RIGHT NOW. WE SEE THINGS MOVING AS WELL
FOR THE PIKE.
AND HERE ARE THE DRIVE TIMES. 24, 18 MINUTES.
THE PIKE FROM 495 TO MASS
AVENUE, DOING OKAY, 25 MINUTES. 495 TO THE LEVERETT CONNECTOR,
A 28-MINUTE RIDE.
GENE, OVER TO YOU. &gt;&gt; Gene:  ALL RIGHT.
THIS IS WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW
AS THINGS WILL BE REALLY KICKING INTO HIGH GEAR ON THE
PIKE.
STICK WITH FOX25 AS WE GET YOU THROUGH ALL THE BIG CHANGES AND
LET YOU KNOW HOW THE VOLUME IS
INCREASING AND HOW LONG THE BACKUPS WILL BE.
BEFORE YOU HEAD OUT THE DOOR A
GOOD IDEA TO DOWNLOAD THAT FOX25 APP AND TURN THE
NOTIFICATIONS ON.

      <description>NEWSCAST AND LASTING THROUGHOUT
THE NIGHT.
&gt;&gt;&gt; A LOOK AT HOW THE ROADS ARE DOING.
AND YOU CAN SEE THE EXPRESSWAY,
ONE OF THE SLOW SPOTS THIS MORNING AS IT TYPICALLY IS
AVERAGING ABOUT
25-MILE-PER-HOUR THROUGH QUINCY MOVING UP THIS WAY.
THE STALLED VEHICLE STILL ON
THE MAP. YOU ARE OKAY IN THIS POCKET 93
SOUTHBOUND.
THE SLOW DOWNS BEGIN IN THE WILMINGTON AREA THROUGH
BURLINGTON AND WOBURN.
SLUGGISH. KEEPING AN EYE ON THE PIKE.
STARTING TO SLOW DOWN IN
POCKETS WHICH IS TYPICAL FOR THIS HOUR OF THE MORNING TO
BEGIN WITH AND WE ARE EXPECTING
IT TO GET MUCH WORSE. YOU ARE SLOW THERE AS YOU
APPROACH FRAMINGHAM AND SLOW AS
YOU GO TOWARD WESTON WHERE THE TOLLS USED TO BE.
TODAY THEY ARE BEING
DECONSTRUCTED AND BECAUSE OF THAT A COUPLE OF LANES ARE
CLOSED AS YOU MOVE EASTBOUND.
MICHAEL HENRICH KEEPING A GOOD EYE ON THAT SITUATION.
LIVE CAMERAS TRAFFIC MOVING
THROUGH 93 HEADED TO THE CITY THROUGH SOMERVILLE AND THE
SULLIVAN SQUARE AREA.
THE PIKE 29 MINUTES. ROUTE 9, 18 MINUTES.
AND SHIRI, A BIG QUESTION
TODAY. IT IS HALLOWEEN, EVERYBODY
WANTS TO KNOW, DO THEY NEED A
COAT OVER THE COSTUME TONIGHT? &gt;&gt; YEAH,  PROBABLY.
NOT THE HEAVY, HEAVY WINTER
COAT BUT SOME FORM OF COAT. NOT LIKE THAT WARM OCTOBER.
IT IS NOT GOING TO BE 27
DEGREES LIKE THAT COLDEST HALLOWEEN.
WE DON'T HAVE RAIN.
WE DON'T HAVE SNOW. BUT WE DO HAVE LITTLE BIT OF A
BREEZE DURING THE AFTERNOON
THAT SHOULD BE DIMINISHING DURING THE EVENING HOURS AND
WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE 40s,
ESPECIALLY KIDS THAT ARE HEADED OUT A LITTLE BIT LATER MORE
LIKE 7 OR 8:00 IN THE LOWER
40s. THAT IS WHEN YOU ARE REALLY
GOING TO WANT YOUR COATS.
RIGHT NOW I DO HAVE A LITTLE BAND OF SHOWERS FORMING OVER
MIDDLE AND THE OUTER CAPE THAT
WILL LINGER HERE FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS.
OTHERWISE THE CLOUD COVER THAT
YOU FIND OVER THE REST OF MASSACHUSETTS AND SOUTHERN NEW
HAMPSHIRE WILL BE BREAKING DOWN
THAT AREA LOW PRESSURE GETS FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY FROM
US.
GO INTO HYANNIS WHERE WE HAVE SOME RAIN REPORTS RIGHT NOW.
12-MILE-PER-HOUR SUSTAINED
WINDS. IT IS IN THE 40s THOUGH.
THIS IS A CHILLY RAIN THIS
MORNING. WE ALSO HAVE THE CLOUDS HAVING
A REALLY TOUGH TIME BREAKING UP
OVER THE CAPE AND MAN IN TUBLINGT SPECIFICALLY.
WE STILL HAVE TEMPERATURES THAT
HEAD UP TO 50 DEGREES THIS AFTERNOON.
FURTHER INLAND YOU ARE GOING TO
FIND WARMER TEMPERATURES LATER CONTINUE TO TODAY.
FUTURECAST TO BREAK DOWN THOSE
EARLY SHOWERS. THE CLOUDS STILL LINGERING INTO
THE EARLY AFTERNOON THERE, BUT
REST OF US LOOK NICE AND BRIGHT AS WE GET INTO YOUR HALLOWEEN
AFTERNOON.
HIGH TEMPERATURES LOWER 50s FROM PORTSMOUTH FROM BEVERLY,
BOSTON AND PLYMOUTH AND
EXTENDING ALL THE WAY BACK THROUGH BEDFORD.
CHILLIER SPOTS IN WORCESTER AT
46  DEGREES. 48 IN KEENE, NEW HAMPSHIRE.
BUT WE DO HAVE THE MOST AMOUNT
OF CLOUD COVER OVER THE CAPE AND ISLAND WITH HIGHS IN THE
LOWER 50s.
TODAY, LET'S CHECK OUT THAT SEVEN-DAY FORECAST FOR THE
WEEKEND ALWAYS IN VIEW BECAUSE
AFTER 50 TODAY. BREEZY AND BRIGHT.
54 HERE TOMORROW WITH PARTLY
CLOUDY SKIES. JUST A FEW MORE SCATTERED
CLOUDS.
BY WEDNESDAY, WE ARE WARMING THINGS UP, BACK INTO THE MIDDLE
60s.
THURSDAY IS YOUR NEXT BET FOR SHOWERS, AND YOU CAN SEE THE
TIMELINE HERE HAVE THAT RAIN
MOVING INLAND ONCE WE GET INTO THE AFTERNOON AND THE EVENING.
SO THAT MORNING COMMUTE RIGHT
NOW LOOKS SAFE ON THURSDAY. THAT IS THE LAST OF WARM
WEATHER THOUGH, BECAUSE BY
FRIDAY, WE HAVE HIGHS BACK INTO THE 50s.
BELOW AVERAGE TEMPERATURES THIS
WEEKEND WITH WAKE-UP TEMPS IN THE 30s AND HIGHS IN THE 50s.
DON'T FORGET, WE GAIN AN HOUR
OF SLEEP HERE EARLY SUNDAY MORNING AS YOU SET THOSE CLOCKS
BACK.
BACK OVER TO YOU, &gt;&gt; Gene:  GENE-O WE WILL TAKE
THAT.

SHIRI SPEAR WITH THE STORM
TRACKER WEATHER CENTER. &gt;&gt; THE ONLY THING SPOOKY ON MY
MAP THE RAIN TOWARD HYANNIS.
AND A BIT OF A WET START. IT WILL END UP BEING MOSTLY
CLOUDY.
WE HAVE GOT MORNING SHOWERS. SHORTLY AFTER SUNRISE, THOSE
SHOWERS MELT AWAY.
BOSTON IN THE MEANTIME, 43 DEGREES AND MOSTLY CLOUDY.
WE ARE AT 36  IN PAYLAND.

      <description>NOT A BIG BACKUP BY ANY MEANS
YET, BUT WE CERTAINLY EXPECT TO
SEE ONE. TAKE A LOOK AT THE SITUATION
RIGHT NOW.
YOU CAN SEE WHAT USED TO BE THE TOLLS HERE.
THE TOLL PLAZAS.
THE SIGNS ARE NOW COVERED UP. THEY ARE NOT TAKING ANY TOLL
CHARGES ANYMORE.
THAT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE 16 GANTRIES UP AND DOWN
EAST AND WEST ON THE PIKE HERE
IN THE COMMONWEALTH. BUT THE PLAZAS ARE STILL HERE
IN THIS SIDE LANES.
MIDDLE LANES JUST SINCE FRIDAY, THEY HAVE ALREADY REMOVED SOME
OF THE TOLL BOOTH NOTICE
CENTER. THE CONSTRUCTION CREWS CONTINUE
TO WORK BASICALLY AROUND THE
CLOCK HERE. BUT BECAUSE OF THE LANE
REDUCTION, WE ARE GOING TO SEE
A SERIOUS BACKUP WHEN THESE ROADS START TO GET EVEN MORE
CROWDED.
AND EVEN HERE, START TO SEE THE BEGINNING -- THE TRUCKS AND
CARS HAVE TO GO 15 MILES PER
HOUR AS LONG AS THESE BOOTHS ARE STILL HERE THIS THEY SLOW
DOWN, THE CARS BEHIND THEM SLOW
DOWN, AND EVENTUALLY AT THE PEAK TRAVEL TIMES, WE ARE GOING
TO SEE AN ABSOLUTE MESS.
HERE IS WHAT THE STATE HIGHWAY TRANSPORTATION ADMINISTRATORS
HAD TO SAY.
&gt;&gt; USE THE MBTA AS AN OPTION TOO.
THIS WOULD BE A REALLY GOOD
WEEK TO DO THAT. IF YOU CAN ALTER YOUR WORK
SCHEDULE IN ANY WAY, A REALLY
GOOD WEEK TO DO THAT AND LATE OR EARLY.
, A GOOD DIE DO THAT.
SO BASICALLY IF YOU CAN AVOID THE PIKE, AVOID THE PIKE.
IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN EASY PASS
TO GO UNDER THE GANTRIES. YOU CAN STILL USE THE PIKE.
WE HAVE BEEN SAYING THIS FOR A
FEW WEEKS NOW AND WE ESPECIALLY SAID IT ON FRIDAY.
A PAY BY PLAY SYSTEM.
YOU CAN GET A BILL IN THE MAIL. IT IS A HIGHER RATE THAN IF YOU
ARE PAYING WITH AN E-ZPASS.
IF YOU SIGN UP FOR E-ZPASS, ON THAT FIRST BILL, WHEN PAYING
THAT PLAY BY PAY BILL, YOU WILL
RECEIVE A CREDIT FOR THE DIFFERENCE.
THAT SON-IN-LAW DURING THESE
FIRST SIX MONTHS AND DO YOU WANT TO ACT ON IT IN THE NEAR
FUTURE.
KEEP AN EYE ON THE ROADS HERE AND KEEP YOU UPDATED THROUGHOUT
THE MORNING.
LIVE IN WESTON, MICHAEL HENRICH, FOX25 NEWS.
&gt;&gt; Gene:  A VIEW OVER ALL OF
THIS WITH SKYFOX WITH JULIE GRAUERT WHO WILL BE REPORTING
LIVE FROM THE THEIR JUST A FEW
MINUTES.</description>

COME WITH FEWER RISK.

IN THE PHOTO IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE MEDFORD PATROLMANS

      <description>ELECTRONIC TOLLING PROCESS IS
ABOUT TO GET ITS FIRST TRUE
TEST. THE MESSAGE IN MORNING, PLAN
FOR A CONGESTED COMMUTE, AND IF
YOU CAN, AVOID THE PIKE. FOX25'S MICHAEL HENRICH IS LIVE
AT THE WESTON TOLLS WHERE WE
HAVE BEEN MONITORING THE SITUATION ALL WEEK LONG,
MICHAEL.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: WHAT A DIFFERENCE A FEW DAYS MAKE A DIFFERENCE
FROM WHEN I WAS OUT HERE FRIDAY
MORNING AND WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE BEHIND ME NOW.
IF YOU WERE TAKING THE PIKE
THIS MORNING BY THE TIME YOU GET TO WORK, IT WILL FEEL LIKE
YOU HAVE BEEN DRIVING FOR DAYS.
EXPECT A LOT OF TRAFFIC BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU SEE HERE.
THE CONSTRUCTION CREWS REALLY
DOMINATING THE LANDSCAPE AT THIS POINT.
SUCCESSFULLY REMOVING MOST OF
THE CENTER TOLLS ALREADY, BUT THAT IS JUST THE MOST VISUAL
PIECE OF THE PUZZLE.
THEY HAVE A LOT OF WORK LEFT TO DO HERE IN WESTON AND AT ABOUT
TWO DOZEN OTHER NOW SHUTDOWN
TOLL BOOTHS UNDER CONSTRUCTION AT THE MOMENT.
OBVIOUSLY WHEN YOU BLOCK OFF
THE CENTER LANES TO TAKE OUT THE TOLL BOOTHS FIRST YOU ARE
TALKING ABOUT FAR FEWER LANES
FOR THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CARS TO TRAVEL ON DURING THE
MORNING COMMUTE.
THIS TRANSITION FROM A TOLL BOOTH SYSTEM TO A COMPLETELY
AUTOMATED ALL AUTOMATIC TOLLING
DID OFFICIALLY TAKE PLACE AND MASS DOT SAID IT IS GOING WELL
AND ALREADY AHEAD OF SCHEDULE
AND MIGHT NOT MAKE YOU DO ANY BETTER DURING THIS MORNING'S
COMMUTE.
AND THE HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATOR HAS ADVICE FOR THAT.
&gt;&gt; USE THE MBTA IF THAT IS AN
OPTION IN WOULD BE A REALLY GOOD WEEK TO DO THAT.
IF YOU CAN ALTER YOUR WORK
SCHEDULE IN ANY WAY, THIS WOULD BE A GOOD WEEK TO DO THAT GO IN
VERY LATE OR VERY EARLY THIS
WOULD BE A VERY GOOD WAY TO DO THAT.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: IF YOU CAN RETIRE
THAT WOULD BE A VERY GOOD WEEK TO DO THAT AS WELL.
IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN E-ZPASS,
STILL USE THE PIKE. GET CHARGED IN THE PAY BY PLAY
AND GET A BILL IN THE MAIL.
IT DOES COST MORE THAN AN E-ZPASS TOLL AND WE TOLD BUT
THIS BEFORE THE GRACE PERIOD
FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS. IF YOU GET A PLAY-BY-PLAY AND
APPLY FOR AN EASY PASS
TRANSPONDER WHEN PAYING THAT BILL, YOU WILL GET A CREDIT FOR
THE DIFFERENCE ON YOUR ACCOUNT.
WE WILL BE WITH YOU THROUGHOUT THE MORNING HERE ON THE PIKE TO
KEEP YOU UPDATED ON HOW THINGS
ARE GOING.</description>

      <description>IN 30 MINUTES.
&gt;&gt;&gt; SEVERAL BOSTON POLICE
OFFICERS ARE ON PAID LEAVE AS A DEADLY SHOOTING IS
INVESTIGATED.
A SOUTH END MAN IS KILLED BY POLICE AFTER POLICE AHE CAME AT
THEM WITH A KNIFE.
THIS STORY WAS BREAKING ON FOX25 MORNING NEWS YESTERDAY.
FOX25 CHRISTINE McCARTHY
REPORTS THE MAN'S FAMILY SAYS HE WAS NOT ARMED.
&gt;&gt; I HEARD TWO GUNSHOTS.
I BELIEVE THEY WERE GUNSHOTS REALLY QUICK LIKE POW, POW.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THOSE GUNSHOTS
TOOK THE LIFE OF 31-YEAR-OLD TERRENCE COLEMAN SHOT BY BOSTON
POLICE WHO SAY THEY HAD NO
CHOICE BUT TO FIRE. COLEMAN'S MOTHER CALLED 911 TO
GET HELP WITH HER SON WITH
PARANOID SCHIZOPHRENIA AND WAS HAVING AN EPISODE.
EMTs ENCOUNTERED A VIOLENT
COLEMAN AFTER MIDNIGHT SUNDAY BEHIND THESE DOORS OF SHAMUT
AVENUE.
POLICE WAITING OUTSIDE. &gt;&gt; AT SOME POINT THE INDIVIDUAL
PULLED OUT A LARGE KNIFE AND
STARTED TO GO AT THE EMS PERSONNEL.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: COMMISSIONER BILL
EVANS SAID OFFICERS HEARD THE COMMOTION AND RUSHED IN.
&gt;&gt; THEY TRIED TO SUBDUE THE
INDIVIDUAL ALSO WITHOUT USING FORCE, BUT HE WAS ABLE TO KEEP
HIS ARMS FREE AND HE STARTED TO
COME AT THE OFFICER. THEY -- IT LEFT HIM NO CHOICE.
UNFORTUNATELY, THEY HAD TO TAKE
THIS YOUNG INDIVIDUAL'S LIFE. &gt;&gt; KIND OF SCARY BECAUSE MY SON
IS SLEEPING RIGHT THERE.
THE 7-MONTH-OLD. KIND OF CRAZY.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: COLEMAN'S FAMILY
DISPUTES THE POLICE ACCOUNT SAYING THAT THE KNIFE WAS
INSIDE AND HE WAS IN THE
HALLWAY WITHOUT IT. ASKED IF NONLETHAL FORCE WOULD
HAVE BEEN MORE APPROPRIATE FOR
A MENTALLY ILL MAN, THE COMMISSIONER SAID IT WASN'T AN
OPTION.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS CLOSE QUARTERS, INSIDE AN APARTMENT.
I DON'T THINK A TASER WOULD
HAVE SAVE THE EMS OR THE OFFICERS' LIVES.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: CHRISTINE
McCARTHY.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN
IS BEING ROCKED BY A NEW
INVESTIGATION. THE FBI IS DIGGING DEEPER INTO
THOUSANDS OF E-MAILS FOUND ON A
DEVICE THAT BELONGED TO HER TOP AIDE, HUMA ABEDIN.
HOW ABEDIN'S PERSONAL LIFE
BECAME PART OF THE INVESTIGATION.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: AFTER A SUBPOENA
WAS ISSUED IN LATE SEPTEMBER, FBI INVESTIGATORS BEGAN COMBING
THROUGH ANTHONY WEINER'S
COMPUTER IN A SEPARATE SEXTING. ALLEGATIONS HE DENIED.
AS THEY SIFTED THROUGH THE
RECORD THEY FOUND E-MAILS FROM CLINTON AIDE HUMA ABEDIN HAD
HAD ACCESS TO THE LAPTOP.
A DEEPER DIVE ON THE MEGA DATAS WHERE THE HITS WERE UNCOVERED.
THE REPUBLICAN CHAIRMAN OF THE
HOUSE COMMITTEE WHO WAS NOTIFIED BY THE FBI SPOKE TO
FOX NEWS SUNDAY CHRIS WALLACE.
&gt;&gt; THIS HAS TO BE A SUBSTANTIAL DEVELOPMENT I DON'T SEE
DIRECTOR COMEY OPENING IT UP
UNLESS IT IS QUITE SERIOUS. &gt;&gt; Reporter: ABEDIN SAID SHE
SENT STATE DEPARTMENT E-MAILS
TO HER PERSONAL YAHOO ACCOUNT WHERE IT WAS EASIER TO PRINT
THAN THE CLUMSY STATE
DEPARTMENT SYSTEM IN JUNE, ABEDIN SWORE UNDER OATH IN THE
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT THAT
SHE NEVER DELETED HER E-MAILS AND SEARCHED THROUGH ALL OF HER
DEVICES FOR GOVERNMENT RECORDS
AND THAT IS NOW IN QUESTION. THE RANKING DEMOCRAT ON THE
COMMITTEE SAY COMEY ACTED
OUTSIDE HIS LANE. &gt;&gt; I THINK THIS WAS A TERRIBLE
ERROR IN JUDGMENT BY THE
DIRECTOR TO RELEASE THIS KIND OF AMBITIOUS -- AMBIGUOUS
LETTERS, THEY MAY BE
SIGNIFICANT, MAY NOT BE SIGNIFICANT.
THIS AMBIGUITY BOMB WAS A
TERRIBLE LAPSE IN JUDGMENT. &gt;&gt; Reporter: IT WAS DRIVEN BY
THE SHEER VOLUME OF E-MAILS AND
THE COMMITMENT HE MADE UNDER OATH.
&gt;&gt; WOULD YOU REOPEN THE CLINTON
INVESTIGATION IF YOU DISCOVERED NEW INFORMATION THAT WAS BOTH
RELEVANT AND SUBSTANTIAL STALL
IN. &gt;&gt; IT'S HARD FOR ME TO ANSWER
IN THE ABSTRACT.
WE WOULD LOOK AT ANY NEW AND SUBSTANTIAL INFORMATION.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: INCREASING
EVIDENCE THAT JAMES COMEY AND HIS EXECUTIVE KNEW OF THE
LAPTOP AND E-MAILS BEFORE THE
NOTIFICATION LETTER ON FRIDAY.</description>

THE WEATHER.
SHIRI SPEAR IN THE STORM TRACKER WEATHER CENTER.
SHIRI, THE RAIN IS GONE AND
SOME WIND STICKING WITH US. &gt;&gt; GREAT TIMING ON THE SHOWERS.
THEY ARE OUT OF HERE AND
DEALING WITH WINDS. WE HAVE SUSTAINED WINDS AT 16
MILES PER HOUR IN BOSTON.
NOT TERRIBLE. THEY DON'T DO ANY DAMAGE BUT
SOMETHING YOU WILL HAVE TO
NOTICE WHEN YOU LEAVE THE HOUSE.
43 IN BOSTON, BEVERLY.
37 IN WORCESTER. 37 IN NASHUA, NEW HAMPSHIRE AND
47 IN CHATHAM.
SO YOUR BREAKTOWN FOR BROCKTON TODAY INVOLVE TEMPERATURES IN
THE LOWER 40s AT 7 A.M.
WE STILL HAVE LINGERING CLOUDS</description>

      <description>DARE.
&gt;&gt;&gt; THERE IS A VERY HAPPY ENDING
TO WHAT WAS A VERY CHILLING START TO THIS STORY.
IN COLUMBIA THIS POLICE OFFICER
IS HOLDING A NEWBORN BABY GIRL SURROUNDED BY CHEERING PEOPLE.
HE IS WALKING THIS CHILD BACK TO
HER FATHER. AT THE HOSPITAL THAT BABY WAS
KIDNAPPED.
&gt;&gt; FROM THE HOSPITAL? &gt;&gt; FROM THE HOSPITAL.
SHE WAS BORN BY A WOMAN WHO HAD
BEFRIENDED THE MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER OF THIS BABY AT THE
HOSPITAL CLAIMING SHE HAD A
RELATIVE IN THE HOSPITAL AND WHEN SHE SAW AN OPPORTUNITY,
TOOK THE BABY, RAN OUT.
FORTUNATELY THIS IS THE MOMENT THAT THE GIRL IS REUNITED WITH
HER DAD WHO IS VISIBLY,
EMOTIONALLY SHAKEN. IN THE VIDEO WE SEE THE MOTHER
IS REUNITED WITH HER DAUGHTER
WHILE SHE'S STILL UNDER THE EFFECTS OF THE MEDICATION,
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY SHE WAS
TRAUMATIZED. &gt;&gt; AS SOON AS THE MOM KNEW WHAT
HAPPENED THEY NO IF IED THE
HOSPITAL STAFF. HERE'S THE VIDEO WITH THE WOMAN
WITH THE CHILD IN A BAG WALKING
OUT OF THE HOSPITAL. AUTHORITIES GOT INVOLVED AND
DECIDED TO USE SOCIAL MEDIA TO
HELP IN THIS CASE SO THEY PUT THE VIDEO OUT AND STARTED
CALLING PEOPLE IN COMMUNITY.
IT TURN OUT THEY WERE ABLE TO CONNECT WITH A TAXI DRIVER THAT
HAD DRIVEN WHOM HE THOUGHT WAS
THIS WOMAN AND THEN ALONG WITH OTHER TIPS HOW THEY WERE ABLE TO
SHOW UP AT THE WOMAN'S
RESIDENCE. THIS WOMAN ON HER FACEBOOK PAGE
HAD SHARED SEVERAL PHOTOS
INTRODUCING HER BABY DAUGHTER TO THE WORLD EVEN NAMED HER.
AS WE SEE IN THIS PICTURE.
&gt;&gt; SHE HAD A PARTY AND EVERYTHING.
SHE WASN'T TRYING TO HIDE THE
FACT AT ALL. &gt;&gt; THIS IS A MENTAL HEALTH
ISSUE.
SOUNDS LIKE THIS WOMAN COULDN'T HAVE KIDS.
&gt;&gt; SHE WAS PREGNANT AND LOST
THAT BABY. THERE'S VIDEO OF THAT MOMENT
WHEN THEY PICK HER UP.
YOU CAN SEE THE SIGN IN THE BACKGROUND WELCOMING THE
DAUGHTER AND THEY WALK WITH HER
OUT OF THE HOME. THE WOMAN THAT TOOK THE CHILD
HAS BEEN ARRESTED AND IS
OBVIOUSLY GOING TO BE FACING SOME SERIOUS CHARGES.
BUT THE GOOD THING IS
AUTHORITIES ACTED QUICKLY, THE COMMUNITY CAME TOGETHER AND ABLE
TO SAFELY FIND THE DAUGHTER AND
REUNITE HER WITH HER PARENTS.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; REMEMBER WHEN THE 6th OF
NOVEMBER.
GUN POWDER AND TREES. FIREWORKS IN JULY BUT IN UK,
PEOPLE GET CRAZY LIKE YOU SEE IN
THIS VIDEO FROM LONDON. YOU CAN SEE THIS.
PEDESTRIANS AND CYCLISTS BEWARE.
&gt;&gt; STARTED TARGETING PEDESTRIANS AND CYCLISTS.
ONE FIREWORK MISSING SOMEONE BY
INCHES. POLICE WERE CALLED.
BY THE TIME THEY SHOWED UP FOUND
SOME INJURED. WE HAVE A TURKEY FOR THIS NEXT
VIDEO.
A COUPLE OF KIDS ACTUALLY THE 15 AND 12 YEARS OLD BREAKING INTO
THIS MUSIC SHOP.
THE KEY, IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT BREAKING AND ENTERING IS
GET IN AND GET OUT.
NOT IN THIS CASE. THESE GUYS WERE PERUSING THESE
INSTRUMENTS.
FOUND SOME THEY LIKED. INSTEAD OF BOLTING THROUGH THE
FRONT DOOR DECIDED TO GIVE HIS
BODY A LITTLE PERFORMANCE. WHILE THEY WERE IN THE STORE FOR
TWO AND A HALF HOURS THEY ENDED
UP GETTING A WHOLE BUNCH OF EQUIPMENT, ALSO TOWARDS THE END
THEY NOTICED THE CAMERAS AND
ATTEMPT TO DESTROY THEM. THEY WERE DONE, THOUGH AFTER
KNOCKING OFF THIS PLACE THEY
WENT TO ROB A SOUVENIR STORE AND ELECTRONICS STORE GETTING INTO
PHONES AND THINGS LIKE THAT
BEFORE MAKING THEIR WAY AWAY. THEY CAUGHT UP WITH THESE TWO
KIDS IN THE VILLAGE TWO DAYS
LATER WHERE POLICE HANDED THEM TO OTHER POLICE IN TURKEY
BECAUSE THEY WERE WANTED FOR
ANOTHER ROBBERY. LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE ALREADY
PRETTY SEVERE CRIMINALS.
&gt;&gt; BREAKING THE LAW, BREAKING</description>

&gt;&gt; HE JUST DOVE IN. &gt;&gt; THAT KITTEN STUCK DOWN THERE.
AMAZING ANYONE HEARD HER.
THE MICHIGAN HUMANE SOCIETY SAID THEY GOT A CALL WHO WAS DRIVING
DOWN A BUSY ROAD, HEARD SOME
CRYING, GETS OUT OF THE CAR, LOOKS IN THE SEWER AND SPOTS
THIS LITTLE KITTEN WHO THEY
NAMED WINNIE. THEY PUT A LEASH AROUND HER AND
PULL HER UP.
SHE'S ABLE TO GET IT AROUND WINNIE.
THERE SHE IS.
&gt;&gt; THAT WAS PRETTY SLICK THERE, TEX.
&gt;&gt; SHE'S TAKEN BACK TO THE
CENTER WHERE THEY DO WHAT THEY DO BEST.
&gt;&gt; SHE WAS SCARED AND SHIVERING.
&gt;&gt; THEY GIVE HER A CHECK UP, CLEAN HER UP, A BATH.
OKAY I THANK YOU.
&gt;&gt; AT THE END OF IT ALL THIS IS HOW SHE LOOKS.
&gt;&gt; THAT LITTLE PAW GOING AFTER
THE CAMERA. &gt;&gt; SO CUTE.
&gt;&gt; THE GOOD NEWS FOR HER IS THAT

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; THE PHILIPPINES IS A
GORGEOUS, LUSH COUNTRY.
WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS A RIVER. WHAT A PERFECT PLACE TO FLY A
DRONE.
HOWEVER, IT MAY NOT BE THE PERFECT DAY BECAUSE VERY WINDY
ON THIS PARTICULAR DAY.
THE PILOT WAS TRYING TO FLY HIS DRONE.
HE NOTICED THE WIND PUSHING HIS
DRONE AROUND. HE TRIED TO PUSH IT HIGHER TO
AVOID THE WINDS, THAT KICKED IT
INTO A TREE AND IT CAME CRASHING DOWN.
HE WAS RESIGNED TO LETTING THE
JUNGLERY CLAIM HIS DRONE. A LOCAL STEPPED INTO ACTION.
YOU CAN SEE THE BLINKING LIGHTS
OF THE DRONE. HERE COMES THE INTREPID RESCUER.
&gt;&gt; I HAVE A FEELING THIS DUDE
HAS DONE THIS BEFORE. &gt;&gt; OFF TO RESCUING DRONES.
&gt;&gt; HERE THEY GO AGAIN.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS LIKE PHILIPPINES NINJA WARRIOR.
&gt;&gt; THERE HAS TO BE A BIG
FINDER'S FEE. &gt;&gt; IT'S DRONE.
IT'S MINE.
HE GETS NEAR THE DRONE. TAKES HIM A MOMENT HOW TO FIGURE
OUT HOW TO REACH IT AND GRAB IT
FROM THE VEGETATION. HE DOES.
NOW HE HAS TO CLIMB BACK DOWN.
&gt;&gt; THIS GUY DESERVES LIKE QUITE A FEW PESOS AND THANK US.
&gt;&gt; PHILIPPINES.
&gt;&gt; PESOS. &gt;&gt; HE MAKES IT TO GROUND LEVEL
AND THE REUNION IS CAUGHT ON
CAMERA. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

      <description>BE GLAD THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN TO
YOU TODAY.
&gt;&gt;&gt; PLUS WE LOST OUR MIND WHEN ON THE PRICE OF RIGHT, THREE
UNSUSPECTING PEOPLE IN THE
STORE. &gt;&gt; WHAT WOULD YOU SAY THAT PINK
SWEATER WOULD COST?
&gt;&gt; 17.98. &gt;&gt; GOOD GUESS.
&gt;&gt; I'LL GO 7.67.
&gt;&gt; 7.67. EXACT NUMBER.
&gt;&gt; HIGHER.
&gt;&gt; YOU RECKON? &gt;&gt; 7.67?
THERE'S A PRICE TAG RIGHT HERE,
7.67. &gt;&gt; COME ON.
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
HOW? &gt;&gt; THAT'S A BIT WEIRD.
THE GUY IS LIKE HUH?
&gt;&gt; ALL THESE PEOPLE, OBVIOUSLY NEED TO SEND THEM TO THE "PRICE

INCLUDING THESE KIDS WHO RECOGNIZE RICH.
25.99.
WANT TO ROUND IT UP OR DOWN? &gt;&gt; NO.
25.99.
NAILED IT. &gt;&gt; AND TIME AFTER TIME AFTER
TIME.
RICHARD IS FINDING INCREDIBLE PEOPLE.
&gt;&gt; THESE PEOPLE START FREAKING
OUT. &gt;&gt; OH, MY GOD.
&gt;&gt; WHAT THE HECK?
&gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE HE'S NOT LEADING THEM THROUGH A BUNCH OF NUMBERS.
THEY ARE JUST GUESSING ONE
NUMBER. IN MANY CASES THE PEOPLE ARE
TURNING THE CARD OVER
THEMSELVES. I WAS LOOKING FOR RICH TO DO A
LITTLE SLEIGHT OF HAPPENED.
THAT'S NOT HAPPENING. THE COOL THING IS AT THE END HE

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; PLUS, A BIG STORY OF THE
MORNING REALLY WILL BE FOR THE
TWO MONTHS AROUND HERE. TOLL BOOTHS ACROSS THE STATE
WILL BE SHUTTING DOWN TONIGHT.
TORN DOWN STARTING THIS WEEKEND.
THE NEW OPEN ROAD TOLLING
SYSTEM MEANS YOU WON'T NEED TO GO DIGGING FOR THE CASH OR
EXCHANGE CHANGE TO PAY FOR THE
TOLLS BUT YOU WILL NEED AN EASY PASS TRANSPONDER IF YOU DON'T
WANT TO PAY EXTRA.
FOX 25'S MICHAEL HENRICH IS LIVE AT THE WESTON TOLLS ALONG
THE PIKE.
IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN E-ZPASS YET, THE STATE IS GIVING
DRIVERS A BREAK.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: YEAH, THERE IS A GRACE PERIOD.
I WILL GET TO THAT IN JUST A
SECOND. I WANT TO ZOOM IN ON THE WESTON
TOLLS BECAUSE IF YOU WERE NOT
GETTING TEARY EYED, YOU SHOULD BE, BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING
AWAY.
THEY ARE GOING AWAY, A LOT -- NOBODY IS ACTUALLY UPSET ABOUT
IT.
MOST PEOPLE ARE HAPPY THAT THEY ARE GOING AWAY.
9:45 TONIGHT, THEY WILL STOP
COLLECTING THE TOLLS AT THE BOOTHS AND 10:00, THE 16
GANTRIES THAT YOU MAY NOTICE
GOING UP OVERHEAD AT THE PIKE WILL GO LIVE AND START
COLLECTING THESE TOLLS.
BREAK IT DOWN HOW IT WORKS AND THEN INTO INTO THAT GRACE
PERIOD.
FIRST AND FOREMOST, IF YOU GET BILLED, IF YOU HAVE A
MASSACHUSETTS-ISSUED E-ZPASS,
YOU WILL GET THAT FOR FREE AND YOU WILL GET A TOLL DISCOUNT.
ALSO BILLED OUT OF STATE
TRANSPONDER THAT DOES NOT GET AS BIG A DISCOUNT AND GANTRIES
WILL SNAP A PICTURE OF YOUR
LICENSE PLATE AND MASS DOT WILL GIVE YOU A BILL WITH THE
ADDITIONAL PROCESSING FEE.
WITH THAT SAID MASS DOT WILL USE THE SIX-MONTH GRACE PERIOD
FOR THE PAY BY PLATE.
IF YOU GET A PAY BY PLATE BILL AND YOU APPLY FOR A NEW E-ZPASS
TRANSPONDER, YOU GET A CREDIT
FOR THE DISCOUNT ON YOUR NEW ACCOUNT.
FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE
PLANNING TO USE THIS PAY BY PLATE SYSTEM, THEY SAID IT IS
IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE YOUR
ADDRESS INFORMATION IS ALL UP TO DATE.
&gt;&gt; IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE
CORRECT ADDRESS ON RECORD, IF YOU GO THROUGH THE TOLL, THEY
WILL SEND THE NOTIFICATION TO
THAT ADDRESS, IF YOU DON'T PAY IT IT CAN BUILD UP AND YOUR
REGISTRATION WILL BE REVOKED
FOR NONPAYMENT OF FINES. &gt;&gt; Reporter: AGAIN THAT IS THE
WORST-CASE SCENARIO FOR A SMALL
PERCENTAGE OF COMMUTERS HERE. MANY PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE
E-ZPASSS ARE EXPECTED TO GET
THEM THIS WEEKEND. MASS DOT IS TRYING TO
ACCOMMODATE PEOPLE WITH THAT --
WITH THAT NEED, SO THEY ARE EXPANDING HOURS AND EXPANDING
HOURS AT DIFFERENT SERVICE
PLAZAS AND SERVICE LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE NEXT FEW DAYS.
YOU CAN GET AN E-ZPASS
TRANSPONDER AT AAA OFFICE IT IS YOU ARE A AAA MEMBER.
OVERALL, MASS DOT SAYS THAT
ABOUT 64% OF COMMUTERS WILL SEE THEIR TOLLS EITHER STAY THE
SAME OR GO SLIGHTLY DOWN, BUT
THAT DOES MEAN SOME PEOPLE WILL EXPERIENCE AN INCREASE, USUALLY
IN THE $.05 TO $.10 TRIP RANGE.
LIVE FROM THE WESTON TOLLS.</description>

LEGALIZING MARIJUANA. THE LATEST SUFFOLK UNIVERSITY

MARIJUANA. 42% OPPOSE IT.
BALLOT QUESTION 2, ALLOW NEW OR
EXPANDED CHARTER SCHOOLS. VOTERS ARE MORE UNDECIDED.
45% SUPPORT THE QUESTION AND 45
OPPOSE IT AS WELL. THAT IS OBVIOUSLY PRETTY SPLIT.
ANOTHER POLL FROM THE BOSTON
GLOBE SHOW HOW VOTERS WILL SIDE IN A HIGH CAL MATCH-UP BETWEEN
ELIZABETH WARREN AND CURRENT
RED SOX ACE CURT SCHILLING. WARREN LEADING 58% TO 24% AMONG
500 LIKELY VOTERS.
WARREN HAVEN'T SAID IF SHE IS RUNNING FOR A SECOND TERM BUT
SCHILLING SAID HE WANTS TO RUN
FOR THAT SEAT. LESS THAN TWO WEEKS AWAY FROM
ELECTION DAY AND WHAT YOU CAN
EXPECT ON NOVEMBER 8. LIVE NEWS COVERAGE STARTING
WITH OUR EVENING NEWSCAST AND
STAY WITH US WITH RESULTS ON THE PRESIDENTIAL AND LOCAL
RACES AS WELL AS THOSE
CONTROVERSIAL BALLOT QUESTIONS. THE UBER DRIVER WHO CRASHED
INTO A BEACON HILL HOME HAD HIS
LICENSE SUSPENDED THREE TIMES AND CAUSED SEVEN CAR ACCIDENTS.
ACCORDING TO THE BOSTON HERALD
JOHN KYLOT HAS SPEEDING VIOLATIONS, ACCIDENTS AND
SAFETY VIOLATIONS.
THE DRIVER'S TOYOTA RAV 4 CRASHED INTO A BRICK WALL IN
BEACON HILL.
DESPITE HIS DRIVING RECORD, HE HE WAS ALLOWED TO DRIVE FOR

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; HAPPENING TODAY, A MAN
ACCUSED OF ROBBING A BOSTON
BANK WILL HEAD TO COURT. HE MAY HAVE HAD IT FIGURED IT
OUT WITH A MASK FROM A GETAWAY
CAR BUT DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS AN OFF DUTY OFFICER WORKING
INSIDE THAT BANK.
JESSICA REYES IS LIVE AT THE WEST WOKS BURRY BANK THIS
MORNING BUT JESS, THE BANK
CLOSED YESTERDAY SO POLICE COULD INVESTIGATE.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: YEAH, IT WAS
CLOSED FOR SEVERAL HOURS AFTER THIS ALL HAPPENED AND AS YOU
SAID, WE KNOW THIS OFFICER WAS
WORKING IN DETAIL INSIDE THE BANK WHEN THIS GUY WALKED IN
WITH A MASK ON.
SHE ENDED UP CHASING AFTER HIM AND THIS MORNING THE RADIO CALL
THAT LED TO HIS ARREST.
&gt;&gt; RED SWEATSHIRT ON AND HAS A MASK ON HIS FACE.
TOOK OFF IN A RED SEDAN ON TO
SPRING STREET. &gt;&gt; THAT IS THE OFFICER YOU HEAR
TALKING TO DISPATCH AS SHE
CALLED FOR BACKUP YESTERDAY. THIS ALL STARTED INSIDE THE
CITY OF BOSTON CREDIT UNION
WHEN THE SUSPECT RICHARD CASANO WALKED IN WITH A MASK OVER HIS
FACE AND A BAG IN HIS HAND.
ASKED HIM TO TAKE OFF THE MASK AND TO HAND OVER THE BAG BUT
INSTEAD HE THEN DEMANDED HER
GUN. THERE WAS A STANDOFF BUT DIDN'T
KNOW WHAT WAS IN THE BAG HE WAS
HOLDING BUT EVENTUALLY DID GRAB IT AWAY FROM HIM AND THAT'S
WHEN POLICE SAY HE TRIED TO RUN
AWAY. THANKS TO A QUICK RADIO CALL
SHE MADE AFTER CHASING AFTER
HIM, A BOSTON POLICE CAPTAIN WAS HERE IN A MATTER OF MINUTES
AND TOGETHER THEY TRACKED HIM
DOWN. ON PAROLE FOR DOING THE EXACT
SAME THING, TRYING TO ROB A
BANK WITH A MASK ON. WE KNOW HE HAS A LONG FAMILIAL
HISTORY AND WILL BE BACK IN
COURT FOR HIS ARRAIGNMENT AND WE WILL BE THERE INSIDE THE
COURT ROOM WHEN THIS IS ALL
HAPPENING.</description>

WEATHER EVERY TEN MINUTES. SOMETIMES WE COMBINE OUR POWERS
OR THE POWERS THAT OUR
COMPUTERS GIVE US, AND ALL OF THIS GREEN ON OUR MAP.
THIS IS SHIRI'S RADAR.
RIGHT NOW NORTH SHORE COMMUTERS GETTING SOAKED.
IF YOU ARE COMING FROM THE
NORTH SHORE, I WOULD BUDGET 10, 15 MINUTES ADDITIONALLY TO YOUR
COMMUTE BECAUSE YOU WILL BE
SOAKING WET OUT THERE. TAKE THE RADAR OFF BECAUSE THE
TRAFFIC BLOW IS STARTING TO
BUILD UP ON 93 SOUTH THROUGH THE WOBURN AREA.
RIGHT NOW OUR HEAVIEST VOLUME
ON THE EXPRESSWAY AND BECAUSE OF AN EARLIER ACCIDENT NEAR
COLUMBIA ROAD.
I SAY HEAVIEST, THE BRAKE LIGHTS WITH US FROM 5:45 THIS
MORNING.
HERE ARE YOUR LIVE DRIVE TIMES. 17  MINUTES ON ROUTE 1.
46 MINUTES ON THE EXPRESSWAY.
MUCH SLOWER THAN UNUSUAL FOR THIS TIME.
AND YOU HEAD NORTHBOUND.
35 ANYONE ON 93 SOUTH AS YOU APPROACH THE LEVERETT
CONNECTOR.
LET'S CHECK IN WITH METEOROLOGIST SHIRI SPEAR NOW.
SHE WAS TRACKING THOSE
TEMPERATURES, RAIN, WIND, KIND OF --
&gt;&gt; Shiri:  GIVE TO ME.
&gt;&gt; Julie:  A LOT FOR COMMUTERS. &gt;&gt; Shiri:  A LOT OUT THERE.
THE HEAVY RAIN THREAT IS
DIMINISHING. WE DON'T HAVE THE SAME
DOWNPOURS AS LAST NIGHT.
WE HAVE RAIN THAT CONTINUES THROUGH THE MORNING COMMUTE.
AND KIND OF IN THE MODERATE
THREAT CATEGORY, AND GOING TO BE VERY BREEZY EVEN AFTER THE
WIND ADVISE RYE EXPIRES AT
10:00. YOU CAN SEE BREEZY CONDITIONS
REALLY JUST ALL FRIDAY LONG,
AND GOT OUR WEATHER SYSTEM COMING THROUGH NOW.
HEAVIEST STUFF TRACKING INTO
MAINE. THE STUFF THAT CAME IN GIVING
BOSTON OVER AN INCH OF RAIN.
NOW LIGHTER, PATCHIER SHOWERS. I DON'T WANT TO SAY ALL LIGHT
BUT A BURST OF STEADY RAIN.
BOSTON UPWARDS OF AN INCH OF RAIN THAT KIND OF AN ESTIMATED
RAINFALL TOTAL FROM RADAR, BUT
BY 9:00, A LOT OF THE SHOWERS FOCUSED NOT JUST NORTH OF THE
PIKE BUT DRIFTING UP INTO
SOUTHERN NEW HAMPSHIRE. A LITTLE NORTHWARD TREND IN THE
SHOWERS THROUGH THE MORNING
COMMUTE. BOSTON STILL POSSIBLY A
LINGERING SHOWER AROUND 9 A.M.
A LITTLE MIDDAY GOOD NEWS. A LOT OF US SEE A LITTLE BIT OF
A LULL AROUND LUNCHTIME TODAY.
STILL MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES. STILL BLUSTERY OUT THERE.
AND ANOTHER BATCHES OF
AFTERNOON SHOWERS THAT PIVOT TO THE COAST AND THIS WILL
PROBABLY IMPACT YOUR DRIVE HOME
FROM WORK LATER ON TODAY. KEVIN WILL BE WATCHING THOSE
PATCHY, LIGHTER SHOWERS OUT
THERE AND STILL HAVE A VERY CLOSE EYE ON THE WIND AS WELL.
STARTING AT 4:00 ON FOX25 NEWS.
BY 8 P.M., A LOT OF THOSE EVENING SHOWERS END UP DRYING
UP AND DIMINISHING THE SLIGHT
RISK YOU WILL GET ONE HERE FOR YOUR FRIDAY NIGHT PLANS.
TEMPERATURES RIGHT NOW IN THE
40s AND IN THE 50s. TEMPERATURES TODAY BARELY
MOVING.
IN FACT ONCE WE HIT THE AFTERNOON, THEY WILL PROBABLY
GO DOWN A COUPLE OF DEGREES.
AND UPPER 40s IN BOSTON AND LAWRENCE AND FITCHBURG.
48 IN PLYMOUTH AND 50  IN NEW
BEDFORD THIS AFTERNOON. UPPER 50s BOTH DAYS IN BOSTON
AND BEVERLY UP TO 60 ON SUNDAY
IN PLYMOUTH. THE RAIN CHANCES ARE GOING TO
BE PRETTY LOW BOTH DAYS THIS
WEEKEND, BUT I THINK THE BETTER CHANCE OF SEEING SOME SHOWERS
IS GOING TO END UP BEING SUNDAY
AS THIS FRONT DRIFTS TOWARD US. WE SPEND MOST OF THE DAY ON THE
WARM SIDE OF THE WHOLE THING.
BUT AS IT IS GOING TO BE CLOSED, IT WILL BE IN THE
NEIGHBORHOOD AND COULD BE ONE
OR TWO POP-UP SHOWERS ON SUNDAY WHICH IS WHY WE SEE THIS HIGHER
RAIN RISK THERE.
50 DEGREES. BREEZY AND MOSTLY CLOUDY WITH
OCCASIONAL SHOWERS.
58 TOMORROW AND PARTLY CLOUDY. SLIGHT RISK OF A SUNDAY
AFTERNOON SHOWER AT 60 DEGREES.
AND FOR HALLOWEEN, IT ISING PRETTY GOOD.
HIGHS 53 DEGREES.
MOSTLY SUNNY. IN THE 40s FOR THE TRICK OR
TRICK OR TREATERS.
BACK TO YOU.</description>

      <description>BACK TO YOU.
&gt;&gt;&gt; BRACING FOR TRAFFIC TROUBLE
ON THE PIKE TODAY AT THE END OF THE ROAD FOR TOLL BOOTHS ALONG
THE BIKE.
STARTING LATE TONIGHT, OPEN ROAD TOLLING GOING ONLINE.
&gt;&gt; Sara:  THE NEW SYSTEM MEANS
YOU CAN NO LONGER PAY CASH FOR THE TOLLS BUT THE CONSTRUCTION
IS THE BIG TALKER.
LIVE AT THE WESTON TOLLS ALONG THE PIKE.
THE STATE IS TELLING PEOPLE TO
BRACE FOR A MUCH SLOWER RIDE. &gt;&gt; Reporter: SLOWER INDEED.
AT LEAST IN THE SHORT TERM.
NOW THESE TOLL BOOTHS THAT WE KNOW AND DREAD WILL SHUT DOWN
AT 9:45.
THE LAST TOLL THEY WILL TAKE, AT 10:00 THE GANTRIES.
THE 16 GANTRIES BUILT OVER THE
PIKE WILL GO LIVE. THESE BOOTHS DON'T JUST
DISAPPEAR, THEY WILL STILL BE
IN YOUR WAY AND TRAFFIC WILL GET WORSE BEFORE IT GETS
BETTER.
THROUGHOUT THE WEEKEND, COMMUTERS ON THE PIKE WILL SEE
CONSTRUCTION CREWS GETTING
READY TO FIRST TEAR DOWN THE CENTER LANE BOOTHS AT THE
DIFFERENT TOLL PLAZAS THAT WILL
PUSH TRAFFIC TO THE OTHER LANES, THE OUTSIDE LANE CAUSING
BACKUP.
DEMOLITION WILL START SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY AND LAST FOR
ABOUT A MONTH ON THE CENTER
LANES. MASS DOT WILL THEN START TAKING
OUT THE OUTER LANE BOOTHS ALONG
WITH ALL THE OTHER BUILDINGS AND NOW OUTDATED INFRASTRUCTURE
THAT YOU SEE ALONG THE TOLL
BOOTH, BUT THAT PROCESS COULD LAST THROUGHOUT 20 17.
YES, LET THAT SOAK IN.
IT COMMUTE IRS PICKING UP E-ZPASSS FOR THE FIRST TIME.
TOLD FOX25 THEY WERE NOT
THRILLED WHAT HAPPENED. &gt;&gt; I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF
EVERYTHING BEING AUTOMATED.
&gt;&gt; MAKING IT MORE CONVENIENT THEY SAY.
WE WILL SEE IF IT ACTUALLY
COMES FAST. &gt;&gt; Reporter: SO WHY DO ALL OF
THAT?
EVENTUALLY MASS DOT SAYS YOU YOU WILLABLE ABLE TO DRIVE
THROUGH THE GANTRIES AT FULL
SPEED WITHOUT DEALING WITH THE CONGESTION AND CONFUSION BY THE
TOLL BOOTHS.
TAXPAYERS ARE EXPECTED TO PAY $5 MILLION IN OPERATING COSTS
BUT THAT DOWN FROM AN ORIGINAL
ESTIMATED PROJECTION OF UP TO $50 MILLION PER YEAR IN
SAVINGS.
QUITE A DIFFERENCE THERE.</description>

      <description>LaGUARDIA THIS MORNING TO START
THEIR INVESTIGATION.
&gt;&gt;&gt; CHAOS ON THE ORANGE LINE SHEDDING NEW LIGHT ON THE
TRANSIT LINE.
THE EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS WERE FOLLOWED EXCEPT ONE, STATE AND
CITY LEADERS SAY THE LINE'S
AGING INFRASTRUCTURE IS STILL IN AGING NEED OF UPGRADES.
LIVE AT THE BACK BAY STATION
THIS MORNING WITH WHAT SOME SAY NEED TO BE CHANGED.
GOOD MORNING, CATHERINE.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: GOOD MORNING, THE MANAGEMENT CONTROL BOARD FOR
THE MBTA WILL BE MEETING TODAY
AT 9:00, AND IT IS NOT KNOWN IF AND HOW MUCH THEY ARE GOING TO
DISCUSS WHAT HAPPENED ON THE
ORANGE LINE EARLIER THIS WEEK. HOWEVER, IT CERTAINLY DOES HAVE
OFFICIALS AND PASSENGERS
CALLING FOR CHANGE. &gt;&gt; IT WAS A CHAOTIC SCENE.
SMOKE FILLING ORANGE LINE CAR
AS THE TRAIN LEFT BACK BAY STATION.
PASSENGERS BREAKING AND
BREAKING OUT WINDOW. WHEN THEY WOULDN'T RUN THE RUSH
HOUR, PASSENGERS EXPRESSED
CONCERNS. &gt;&gt; PUSH GUYS OUT.
GO ABOUT THREE INCHES CLOSER.
OKAY. &gt;&gt; Reporter: THE DETAILS FOX25
ALL THE EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS
WERE FOLLOWED EXCEPT THE MOTOR PERSON FAILED TO MAKE PROPER
ANNOUNCEMENTS.
IF HE HAD FOLLOWED HIS TRAINING, THE CUSTOMERS WOULD
HAVE HEARD HE WAS WALKING
THROUGH THE TRAIN TO OPEN EACH DOOR.
THIS EMPLOYEE WILL BE RETRAINED
FOR HANDLING EMERGENCY EVENTS. THE T SAYS THE DOORS NEED TO BE
MANUALLY OPENED FOR PASSENGER
SAFETY &gt;&gt; THE WAY THOSE CARS WERE
DESIGNED, YOU KNOW.
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 1970s TECHNOLOGY.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: BUT THE T'S AGING
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT HAS NOT ONLY PASSENGERS BUT CITY
OFFICIALS CONCERNED.
MAYOR WALSH IS SUGGESTING A 10 TO 15-YEAR MASTER PLAN TO
UPGRADE T PHRASE INSTEAD OF A
TAX OR FEE THAT MAY BE NECESSARY TO GET IT DONE.
FOR NOW ONE THING IS CLEAR.
&gt;&gt; NO QUICK FIX TO THE ORANGE LINE.
WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE
SIGNALS ARE IMPROVED, AND, YOU KNOW, THE NEW CARS COME IN.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: WHILE MAYOR WALSH
IS SUGGESTING SOME TYPE OF INVESTMENT TO BRING IT UP TO
SPEED, MAYOR WALSH SAID NOT
ABOUT THE INVESTMENT BUT THE MANAGEMENT WHICH IS A PROBLEM
WHEN IT COMES TO THE MBTA.
THE UNION HAS COMMENTED TO THE GLOBE THAT THAT TAKES THE FOCUS
AWAY FROM WHERE IT REALLY
SHOULD BE THE FACT THAT THE MBTA IS AN AGING SYSTEM AND HAS
FALL NOON DISREPAIR.
A LOT OF OPINIONS ABOUT THIS. WE WILL KEEP YOU POSTED AS WE
CONTINUE TO DEVELOP.

MORNING NEWS.
&gt;&gt;&gt; HALLOWEEN IS ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING NIGHTS OF THE
YEAR FOR CHILDREN, AND TRICK OR
TRICK OR TREATING IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER, BUT FOR
PARENTS AND POLICE, A BIG FOCUS
ON KEEPING KIDS SAFE ON THE STREETS.
IN METHEUN, POLICE ARE MAKING
IT EASIER TO FIND SAFE NEIGHBORHOODS FOR THEIR TRICK
OR TREATERS.
PUTTING THOUGHT MAP FOR PARENTS TO CHECK OUT.
IN PINS REPRESENT HOMES OR
ADDRESSES OF LEVEL 3 SEX OFFENDERS IN HIS TOWN.
&gt;&gt; WE FOUND IT TO BE EXTREMELY
HELPFUL LAST YEAR IN HALLOWEEN. WE FIELDED A LOT OF CALLS OF
PEOPLE WHO WERE NERVOUS BECAUSE
THEY DIDN'T KNOW THIS WAS IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: METHEUN POLICE
WILL HAVE EXTRA OFFICERS PATROLLING NEIGHBORHOODS.
IF YOU WANT TO SEE IF THERE ARE

      <description>âª.
&gt;&gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO LOVE THAT.
THIS HOMEOWNER HAD RIVERSIDE, CALIFORNIA IS GOING ALL OUT FOR
HALLOWEEN.
THEY SET UP A LIGHT SHOW TIMED TO MUSIC FROM THE "ROCKY HORROR
PICTURE SHOW."
THIS YEAR THE DISPLAY HAS SINGING FACES AND FLASHING
LIGHTS TIMED UP TO CLIPS FROM
THE CLASSIC MOVIE. THE FAMILY HAS BEEN PUTTING ON
HALLOWEEN SHOWS FOR SEVERAL
YEARS. &gt;&gt; Gene:  GREAT.
YOU KNOW WHAT IS GREAT BESIDE
THE LIGHT SHOW AND THE TIMELY MUSIC, THAT IT IS NOT IN MY
NEIGHBORHOOD.
&gt;&gt; Shiri:  LIKE LIGHTS OUT AT 8:00.
&gt;&gt; Gene:  AFTER A WHILE, OKAY,
WE GET IT. YOU LIKE HALLOWEEN.
LET'S MOVE ON.
&gt;&gt; Sarah:  WE LIVED ON A STREET CALLED CHRISTMAS TREE LANE AND
EVERYBODY WOULD DECORATE AND
PEOPLE WOULD GO THROUGH OUR NEIGHBORHOODS UNTIL THE WEE
HOURS OF THE NIGHT.
&gt;&gt; Gene:  YOU ALMOST HAVE TO DO THAT.
&gt;&gt; Shiri:  I FEEL THE SAME.
I FEEL THE SAME. DO YOU REALIZE THIS MONTH, THIS
IS THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE
ACTUALLY BEEN ABOVE AVERAGE WITH THE EXPECTED RAINFALL
TOTAL SINCE FEBRUARY.
AND WE HAD ALL DRY MONTHS. YESTERDAY'S RAIN DEFINITELY
HELPS.
WE HAVE .65 INCHES OF RAIN IN BOSTON, WE GOT ALMOST AN INCH
OF RAIN IN WORCESTER.
AND WE ADD THAT TO WHAT WE HAD SINCE MIDNIGHT.
ALWAYS OVER AN INCH IN BOSTON.
GREAT STUFF. WINDS GUSTING 29 MILES PER
HOUR.
A VERY WIND-BLOWN FRIDAY AHEAD. THE NEXT SEVERAL HOURS HANGING
OUT IN THE LOWER 50s HERE AND
WE DO HAVE THE RISK FOR PASSING SHOWERS THIS MORNING.
ANOTHER BATCH OF RAIN MOVING
INTO BOSTON PROBABLY HALF AN HOUR WITH LIGHT RAIN.
AND TEMPERATURES DRIFTING
SOUTHWARD THIS AFTERNOON. THAT IS A LITTLE BIT BACKWARDS
AND WE SEE THIS NICE LITTLE
BLIP IN TEMPERATURES FOR THE SECOND HALF OF THE DAY.
HEAVY RAIN SHIFTING INTO MAINE
AND ANOTHER BATCH ROTATING TOWARD US THAT IS FLOWING
AROUND OUR AREA OF LOW
PRESSURE. IT IS GOING TO BE GUSTY.
IT IS GOING TO BE WET HERE.
AT 8 A.M., THE BEST BET FOR RAIN ALONG AND NORTH OF THE
MASS PIKE AND WE ARE THINKING
THE STEADIEST STUFF IN SOUTHERN NEW HAMPSHIRE.
WE HEAD TOWARD NOONTIME, DON'T
WANT TO DISCOUNT THE RISK OF SHOWERS AND MOST OF WILL YOU BE
DRY.
THE FURTHER NORTH, THE BETTER FOR RAIN.
WIND WILL BE WITH US ALL DAY.
AND YOU CAN SEE THE AFTERNOON GUSTS WITH THE SLIGHT RISK OF A
SHOWER OR TWO IN EASTERN
MASSACHUSETTS FOR THE DRIVE HOME FROM WORK.
WINDS GUST BEING 30 TO 35 MILES
PER HOUR HERE. AND THAT WILL BE COMING DOWN
WERE THE POTENTIAL GUSTING AS
HIGH AS 45 MILES PER HOUR THIS MORNING.
AND THAT'S WHY I HAVE A WIND
ADVISORY POSTED UNTIL 10 A.M. AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES, LET'S
PLAN ON DOWN INTO THE UPPER 40s
IN AND AROUND THE BOSTON AREA FOR THE WEEKEND.
SIMILAR TEMPERATURES BOTH DAYS.
UPPER 50s SATURDAY AND SUNDAY IN BOSTON.
MIDDLE 50s BOTH DAYS IN THE
WORCESTER AREA. THE BEST BET FOR SHOWERS WILL
BE ALONG THE FRONT HERE.
AND FUTURECAST NOT SHOWING US. ENOUGH OF A TRIGGER WE CAN GET
ONE OR TWO OF THEM OUT HERE.
AND 50 TODAY. 58 TOMORROW.
AND 60 ON SUNDAY WITH A LOT OF
CLOUDS AROUND FOR THE WEEKEND. JULIE IS HERE WITH LIVE DRIVE
TIME TRAFFIC.
&gt;&gt; Julie:  SHIRI, GOOD MORNING. ACCIDENT ROUTE 3 SOUTHBOUND IN
THE PROCESS OF BEING CLEARED
OUT, BUT A LITTLE BIT OF VOLUME BUILDING SOUTHBOUND AND
NORTHBOUND AS PEOPLE TAP THE
BREAKS TO SEE WHAT IS GOING ON. SHIFTING TONIGHT PIKE, THAT
LOOKS GOOD BUT EXPRESSWAY
BACKED UP NORTHBOUND. FOUR NORTHBOUND RIDERS, BECAUSE
OF AN EARLIER ACCIDENT WE ARE
WAITING TO CLEAR AND LOOK AT THIS, THE REFLECTION OF THE
HEADLIGHTS OFF OF WET PAVEMENT.
THE TAIL LIGHTS AND BRAKE LIGHTS, SLOW GOING PAST THE GAS
TANK.
13 MINUTES ON ROUTE 1. 28 MINUTES ON 93 SOUTH.
BUT 23 MINUTES ON THE
EXPRESSWAY AS YOU HEAD FROM BRAINTREE TO THE EXIT TO THE
PIKE.
BACK TO YOU.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; A FOLLOW-UP NOW TO A STORY
THAT FOX25 INVESTIGATES FIRST
BROKE LAST WEEK. SEVERAL REGISTERED SEX
OFFENDERS LIVING IN THE SAME
DORCHESTER HOME AS WE REPORTED THE ACT IS NOT AGAINST THE LAW.
FOX25'S DANIEL MILLER JOINS US
NOW AND DANIEL, NOW FOX25 HAS LEARNED THAT ALL OF THESE MEN
WERE PLACED THERE BY A LOCAL
AGENCY THAT DESCRIBES ITSELF AS A PROGRAM TO END HOMELESSNESS.
&gt;&gt; THE AGENCY'S WEB SITE SAYS
WANTS TO END AND PREVENT HOMELESSNESS.
THE MAN YOU SEE LIVED IN THE
HOME HERE SAYS HE UNDERSTANDS WHY NEIGHBORS ARE UPSET, BUT HE
AND OTHER VETS WHO LIVE THERE
ARE PART OF A PROGRAM, ALL OF THEM PLACED INTO WHAT IS NOW AN
ILLEGAL ROOMING HOUSE.
&gt;&gt;. &gt;&gt; I THINK PUTTING SEVEN LEVEL
3 SEX OFFENDERS IN A
NEIGHBORHOOD LIKE THIS IS OFF THE WALL.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: BILL TOLD US NOT
TO SHOW HIS FACE IN CAMERA. HE LIVES IN THIS THREE-FAMILY
APARTMENT AT 96 MILTON AVE IN
DORCHESTER. FOX25 REVEALED THAT THE HOME IS
OM PIED BY SEVERAL SEX
OFFENDERS WHO ARE ALSO VETERANS.
BILL IS ONE OF THEM.
&gt;&gt; I AM A LEVEL 2 SEX OFFENDER. I HAVE BEEN OUT FOR 15  YEARS.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: HE TELLS FOX25 AT
LEAST ONE OTHER LEVEL 2 SEX OFFENDER LIVES HERE AND SEVEN
LEVEL 3  SEX OFFENDERS THAT HAS
NEIGHBORS SCARED AND ANGRY. &gt;&gt; THEY ARE NOT THINKING ABOUT
THE COMMUNITY.
THEY ARE NOT THINKING ABOUT THE YOUNG CHILDREN RUNNING AROUND
HERE.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: DAWN BARRETT LIVES BEHIND THE HOUSE AND HAS TWO
SONS AND NOW LEARNED THAT THE
HOUSE IS AN ILLEGAL ROOMING HOUSE, STRAIGHT FROM THE HEAD
OF BOSTON'S INSPECTIONAL
SERVICES DEPARTMENT. BUT THAT IS NOT ALL, FOX25 HAS
LEARNED THAT HOME START, A
NONPROFIT PLACED MANY OF THE VETERANS AT THE HOME.
&gt;&gt; THERE IS AT LEAST, I WOULD
SAY, SEVEN OR EIGHT, AND TO THE SAME PROGRAM.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: IT IS UNCLEAR IF
HOME START KNEW ALL THE VETS ARE SEX OFFENDERS.
WE REACHED OUT TO THE EXECUTIVE
DIRECTOR BY E-MAIL, BUT WE HAVE NOT HEARD BACK.
HE SAYS THE HOMEOWNER WORKED
WITH A LOCAL BROKER TO SEND VETS, MANY WITH SEX OFFENDER
RECORDS, TO 9 MILTON AVE.
BILL UNDERSTANDS WHY HIS NEIGHBORS ARE UPSET.
HE SAYS ALL HE AND THE OTHER
VETS WANT IS A TO FIND A NEW HOME.
&gt;&gt; THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE
HOUSE DON'T WANT TO BE THERE. NO ONE WANT TO BE THERE RIGHT
NOW.
&gt;&gt; Daniel:  WE ARE INVESTIGATING WHO OWNS THAT
HOUSE AND WHO ACTUALLY HELPED
TO FUNNEL ALL OF THE SEX OFFENDERS TO ONE LOCATION.
WE WILL KEEP YOU POSTED ON WHAT
WE FIND OUT.</description>

      <description>AFTER CAR ACCIDENTS.
&gt;&gt;&gt; IT IS OCTOBER 27.
I AM SARA UNDERWOOD. &gt;&gt; Gene:  AND I AM GENE
LAVANCHY.
A LOOK AT SOME OF THE RAIN COMING DOWN AS ONE OF OUR
PHOTOGRAPHERS WAS DRIVING INTO
WORK. MOST OF THE RAIN MADE ITS WAY
OUT.
THE CONCERN WAS THE WIND. STORM TRACKER WEATHER CENTER
WATCHING FOR POSSIBLE DAMAGE AS
FAR AS THAT GOES. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE A WIND ADVISORY THAT
GOES ALL THE WAY UNTIL 10:00
THIS MORNING ACROSS EASTERN MASS ALL THE WAY TO THE CAPE
AND ISLANDS.
GUSTS HIGH AS 45 MILES PER HOUR.
EVEN ONCE THAT EXPIRES.
WE ARE STILL GOING TO BE A VERY BLUSTERY FRIDAY AHEAD.
CURRENTLY DRY AND 53 IN BOSTON.

      <description>TIME TRAFFIC AND A CHECK OF THE
ROADS.
&gt;&gt; Julie:  EXPRESSWAY MOVING ALONG FINE AND NOT A LOT OF
VOLUME.
LEAVE A FEW MINUTES EARLY BECAUSE THOSE ROADS WILL STAY
WET AND CREATE SLIPPERY
CONDITIONS. 128 MOVING ALONG WITHOUT ISSUE
AND ROUTE 1 IS CLEAR.
LIVE DRIVE TIMES. 24 MINUTES ON THE PIKE
EASTBOUND.
11 MINUTES ON THE EXPRESSWAY. 11 MINUTES ON 93 SOUTH AS YOU
APPROACH THE ZAKIM BRIDGE.

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; BRACING FOR TRAFFIC
TROUBLES ON THE MASS PIKE.
THE END OF THE ROAD FOR THE TOLL BOOTHS ALONG THE PIKE.
STARTING LATE TONIGHT.
OPEN ROAD TOLLING GOES ONLINE. &gt;&gt; Sara:  YOU CAN NO LONGER PAY
CASH FOR THE TOLLS BUT IF YOU
DON'T HAVE ONE YET, HOW TO TAKE A BREAK.
HOW THE STATE IS TRYING TO GET
MORE DRIVERS TO SIGN UP FOR THOSE TRANSPONDERS, MICHAEL.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: IMPORTANT TO MASS
DOT BECAUSE MASSACHUSETTS IS SWITCHING TO ALL ELECTRONIC
TOLLING STARTING TODAY SO WE
CAN SAY GOODBYE TO THE TOLL BOOTHS LIKE THE ONE IN WESTON
THAT WE HAVE COME TO KNOW AND
DREAD OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DECADES.
THEY WILL BE GONE THROUGH AND
SOON IS RELATIVE. THEY WILL STOP COLLECTING TOLLS
TONIGHT AT 9:45 P.M. AT 10:00
TONIGHT, THE 16 GANTRIES THAT YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED GONE UP
OVERHEAD ON THE PIKE WILL GO
LIVE AND START COLLECTING THE TOLLS.
YOU WILL EITHER GET BILLED
THROUGH A MASSACHUSETTS-ISSUED E-ZPASS WHICH IS FREE TO GET
AND COMES WITH A TOLL DISCOUNT.
AN OUT-OF-STATE TRANSPONDER WITH NOT THAT BIG OF DISCOUNT
OR THE GANTRIES WILL SNAP A
PICTURE OF YOUR LICENSE PLATE AND A BILL THAT WILL COME WITH
AN ADDITIONAL FEE.
MASS DOT IS ISSUING A SIX-MONTH GRACE PERIOD FOR THOSE PAY-BY
OPINION PLATE CUSTOMERS IF YOU
GET A PAY-FOR-PLATE AND APPLY FOR TRANSPONDER YOU WILL GET A
CREDIT FOR THE DISCOUNT ON YOUR
NEW ACCOUNT. ONE INSURANCE AGENT SPOKE WITH
FOX25 AND SAID IT IS VERY
IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE YOUR ADDRESS INFORMATION IS UP TO
DATE ON YOUR LICENSE AND
REGISTRATION IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN E-ZPASS.
&gt;&gt; IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE
CORRECT ADDRESS ON RECORD, IF YOU GO THROUGH A TOLL, THEY
WILL SEND THE NOTIFICATION TO
THAT ADDRESS AND THEN IF YOU DON'T PAY IT, IT CAN BUILD UP
AND YOUR REGISTRATION WILL BE
PULLED FOR NONPAVEMENT OF FUNDS.
&gt;&gt; AGAIN THAT IS THE WORST-CASE
SCENARIO IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN EASY PASS OR IF YOUR
INFORMATION IS NOT UP TO DATE.
NOW MANY PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE THOSE TRANSPONDERS ARE EXPECTED
TO GET THEM THIS WEEKEND SO
MASS DOS IS EXTENDING THE OPERATING HOURS AT VARIOUS
LOCATIONS AND YOU CAN ALSO PICK
THEM UP AT TRIM A OFFICES IF</description>

      <description>OUR AAA MEMBER.
LIVE AT THE WESTON TOLLS.
&gt;&gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE IN PRICE OF PEOPLE WITH AN EASY
PASS VERSUS THOSE WITHOUT IT.
&gt;&gt; IT WILL VARY DEPENDING ON WHICH 16 GANTRIES YOU GO UNDER.
IT WILL RANGE FROM $.15 TO $.60
TO $.65 PER TOLL. THERE IS A BENEFIT FINANCIALLY
FOR HAVING THAT E-ZPASS.
OVERALL CUSTOMERS MIGHT NOTICE -- THEY MAY NOTICE THE
DIFFERENCE IN WHAT THEY ARE
PAYING. GOING FROM 26  TOLLS BOOTHS TO
16 GANTRIES.
THEY HAD TO CHANGE THE DIFFERENCE IN PRICING TO MAKE
SURE IT IS REVENUE NEUTRAL FOR
THE STATE. OVERALL, THOUGH, TWO-THIRDS OF
COMMUTERS SHOULD SEE THEIR TOLL
BILLS STAY EITHER THE SAME OR EVEN GO DOWN A LITTLE BIT,
SARA.
&gt;&gt; Sara:  ALL RIGHT, MICHAEL HENRICH LIVE IN WESTON.
FOX25 IS COMMITTED TO GETTING
YOU THROUGHOUT IMPENDING TRAFFIC TROUBLES ON THE PIKE.
TRIPLE TEAM COVERAGE HON
MORNING. MICHAEL HENRICH WILL BE BACK
LIVE AT A TOLL PLAZA LIVE.
OUR DANIEL MILLER WILL BE FROM A CAR DRIVING THE PIKE IN THE
THICK OF RUSH HOUR.
AND JULIE GRAUERT WILL BE UPDATING DRIVE TIMES AND
POINTING OUT A COUPLE OF SPOTS
EVERY TEN MINUTES.</description>

DANIEL, PEOPLE ON BOARD THIS PLANE SAY IT WAS A SCARY
SITUATION.

WAS ACTUALLY ON THE PLANE.
FOX NEWS REPORTER DAN GALLO POSTED THE VIDEO OF HIM AND
OTHER REPORTERS GETTING OFF THE
PLANE AND BEING GREETED BY A SEA OF EMERGENCY VEHICLES.
THE WEATHER IN NEW YORK WAS

HE GOT OUT.
EVERYBODY IS FINE. &gt;&gt; Daniel:  GOVERNOR PENCE'S
SPOKESPERSON THANKED ALL OF THE

      <description>THE BANK IN WEST ROXBURY THIS
MORNING.
&gt;&gt;&gt; SARA, THE MAN WALKED INTO THE CITY OF BOSTON CREDIT UNION
WITH A MASK OVER HIS FACE
WAITING TO ROB THE PLACE, BUT AS HE SAID, WHAT HE DIDN'T KNOW
THAT A POLICE OFFICER WAS
INSIDE SITTING THERE. SHE WAS BARELY DOING A DETAIL
SHIFT IN THE BANK AND
IMMEDIATELY KNEW SOMETHING WAS OFF WHEN HE WALKED INSIDE TO
THE BANK AND SHE IMMEDIATE LEAD
ORDERED HIM TO TAKE OFF THAT MASK AND HAND OVER A BAG.
HE NOT ONLY DID NOT LISTEN TO
HER BUT TOOK IT ONE STEP FURTHER AND ASK DEMANDED SHE
HANDLED OVER HER GUN.
SHE WAS ABLE TO TAKE THE BAG AWAY AND HE TOOK OFF RUNNING
AND SHE WORKED QUICKLY
BROADCASTING OVER HER RADIO. &gt;&gt; RED SWEATSHIRT AND HE HAS A
MASK ON HIS FACE.
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE A MALE WEARING A MASK, A RED SWEATER.
&gt;&gt; TOOK OFF IN A RED SEDAN,
HONDA, SPRING STREET. &gt;&gt; Reporter: A BOSTON POLICE
CAPTAIN, HE ANSWERED THAT CALL
FIRST. HE PICKED UP DETAIL AT THE BANK
AND TOGETHER THEY TRACKED THAT
SUSPECT DOWN A CUP OF STREETS AWAY IN THAT RED SEDAN.
WE LEARNED THAT HIS NAME IS
ROBERT CASANO AND NOTHING NEW FOR HIM.
HE WAS ON PAROLE FOR THE SAME
EXACT THING. AN ATTEMPTED ROBBERY WITH A
MASK LAST YEAR.
WE KNOW HE IS DUE IN COURT LATER THIS MORNING FOR HIS
ARRAIGNMENT IN WEST ROXBURY.
WE WILL BE HERE AS SOON AS HE FACES A JUDGE IN JUST A FEW
HOURS.

&gt;&gt;&gt; YOU ARE WATCHING TWO U.S.
MARSHALS HANDCUFF JAMES MASERO. THEY SHOUTED PROFANITIES AND
DRAGGED HIM ACROSS THE COURT
ROOM AND ONE DEPUTY KICKED HIM THREE TIMES AFTER HE AND TO BE
IN HANDCUFFS.
HIS FIANCEE CHRISTINA CARR WAS IN THE COURT ROOM.
&gt;&gt; I TURNED AROUND BECAUSE I
COULDN'T SEE IT. I HEARD HIM SCREAMING MOTHER
IF'ER I AM GOING TO BREAK YOUR
M-IF'ING WRIST. &gt;&gt; ACCORDING TO COURT RECORDS.
WAS EMOTIONALLY DISTRAUGHT AND
REFUSED TO PUT HIS HAND BEHIND HIS BACK.
THE JUDGE SAID THE LEAD WAS
AGGRESSIVE AND PROFANE FROM THE START BUT I THINK NECESSARILY
SO.
IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE JUDGE DOES NOT CONTROL THE
MARSHALS.
MASERO REMAINS LOCKED UP ON NEW CHARGES RESISTING A OFFICER.
THEY CONFIRM THAT HE HAS A
HISTORY OF MENTAL ILLNESS. THE U.S. MARSHAL'S SERVICE WILL
NOT TALK OF SPECIFICS BECAUSE
OF THE PENDING CASE. THEY E-MAILED A STATEMENT
SAYING THE U.S. MARSHAL WAS
INJURED DURING THE TAKEDOWN.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; GOOD MORNING, IT IS 5:17.
WE TRACK TRAFFIC AND WEATHER
TOGETHER EVERY TEN MINUTES. ON DAYS LIKE TODAY, IT IS
HELPFUL TO BARROW SOME OF
SHIRI'S TOOLS AND PUT THE RADAR UP OVER THE TRAFFIC MAP.
ROUTE 1 IN THE PEABODY AREA AND
PARTS OF 128 ARE STILL GETTING WET.
I WILL LEAVE THE FORECASTING TO
HER BUT JUST WANTED TO MAKE YOU AWARE.
I TURNED OFF THE RADAR SO YOU
CAN SEE THE ROADS A LITTLE BIT BETTER.
EXPRESSWAY MOVING ALONG FINE.
NO ISSUES ON 128. LIVE DRIVE TIMES.
10 MINUTES ON THE EXPRESSWAY.
20 MINUTES ON 93 SOUTH FROM 495 TO THE LEVERETT CONNECTOR.
11 MINUTES ON 128 NORTHBOUND
FROM WESTWOOD TO THE WESTON TOLLS.
METEOROLOGIST SHIRI SPEAR
JOINING US NOW WITH SNOW REPORTS FROM YESTERDAY AND SOME
OF THESE TALLIES HERE -- WOW.
&gt;&gt; Shiri:  JUST BE THANKFUL IT WASN'T US, RIGHT.
WE KEPT IT ALL OUT WEST.
WE GOT OVER A HALF A FOOT OF SNOW IN ROWE, MASSACHUSETTS.
A LOT FALLING IN THE WESTERN
MASS. AND VALLEYS.
NORTHAMPTON WITH TWO INCHES
TAMPA SPRINGFIELD WITH AN INCH OF KNOW LOCALLY IN TOUGH.
IT WAS MOSTLY RAIN FOR US AND
HEAVY RAIN AND DAMAGING WINDS. THE ITEMS WE ARE TRACKING HERE.
WE WILL HAVE TO CHANGE THAT
BECAUSE THE HEAVY RAIN RISK WILL BE QUITE LIGHT.
WE HAVE LINGERING SHOWERS.
VERY BREEZY EVEN AFTER THE THREAT FOR ANY DAMAGING GUSTS
DISSIPATE TODAY.
A WIND-BLOWN FRIDAY FOR SURE. HERE IS YOUR HEAVY RAIN PUSHING
OFFSHORE INTO PARTS OF MAINE.
BUT BACK BEHIND US, THESE ADDITIONAL SHOWERS OVER CENTRAL
MASS PIVOTING BACK TOWARD
BOSTON AND THE EAST COAST. SO HERE IS THE GAME PLAN.
OVER AN INCH OF RAIN ALREADY IN
THE BOSTON AREA AND WE ARE PROBABLY GET A LITTLE BIT MORE.
PROBABLY TALKING LESS THAN A
QUARTER OF INCH OF RAIN THROUGHOUT THE DAY.
THROUGH THE NEXT CUP OF HOURS.
YOU WILL FIND A LOT OF THOSE SHOWERS FOCUSED NORTH OF THE
MASS PIKE.
THE BEST BET IS OVER NORTHERN MASS INTO THE BOSTON AREA INTO
SOUTHERN NEW HAMPSHIRE FOR
WIDELY SCATTERED HOURS. NOONTIME, I KNOW MOST OF ARE
YOU LOOKING DRY.
I DON'T WANT TO YOU DISCOUNT THE RAIN IN SOUTHERN NEW
HAMPSHIRE BECAUSE A CUP OF
SHOWERS LEAK SOUTH AND THEY SPREAD TOWARD EASTERN
MASSACHUSETTS IN TIME FOR THE
EVENING COMMUTE. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A CUP OF
THUNDERSHOWERS KEVIN IS
WATCHING FOR YOU ON THAT DRIVE HOME FROM WORK AND SHOULD BE
TAPERING OFF DURING THE
EVENINGS HOURS. A SLIGHT RISK THIS HE COULD
INTERRUPT WITH YOUR FRIDAY
NIGHT PLANS. TEMPERATURE-WISE, A LOT OF 40s,
50s.
HERE IS THE THING. TEMPERATURES REALLY NOT MOVING
VERY MUCH.
I SAID A LOT OF THE RAIN IS FOCUSED NORTH OF THE PIKE AND
SOUTH OF THE PIKE PLYMOUTH AT
53 DEGREES RIGHT NOW. SUSTAINED WINDS 17.
YOUR GUSTS ARE STRONGER.
TEMPERATURE-WISE, PROBABLY DROP IN THE UPPER 40s AND STAY THERE
FOR MOST OF THE AFTERNOON.
WITH WE ARE HOPING FOR A CUP OF BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS BUT THE
CLOUDS WILL BE STUBBORN.
UP TO 49 IN UPSWITCH. 50 IN NEW BEDFORD.
THIS WEEKEND I HAVE PARTLY
CLOUDY BUT MOSTLY DRY CONDITIONS WITH UPPER 50s IN
BOSTON, BEVERLY AND PLYMOUTH
TOMORROW. WORCESTER ABOUT 54 DEGREES.
SLIGHT CHANCE OF A SHOWER.
I AM HOPING FOR LITTLE BIT OF A WARM-UP AND SEVEN-DAY FORECAST
ALWAYS IN VIEW.
SUNDAY UP TO 60 DEGREES WITH THAT SLIGHT RISK OF SOME
SHOWERS.
MONDAY LOOKING GREAT FOR TRICK OR TREATERS.
3 DEGREES.
YOUR HIGH FOR TRICK OR TREATING ITSELF WILL BE IN THE 40s AND
STICK WITH 50s AND EVEN 60s FOR
HIGH TEMPERATURES THIS WEEK.</description>

THE BUS WAS TAKING A FEW DOZEN STUDENTS HOME FROM BERZANI
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WHEN IT HIT A
HOUSE ON KITER STREET TUESDAY. THE DRIVER AND SEVERAL STUDENTS
WERE TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL BUT
WOULD BE OKAY. FOX25 LEARNED THAT MARK WOODS
OF QUINCY WAS BEHIND THE WHEEL
OF THE BUS. WE PULLED HIS DRIVING RECORD
AND DID NOT FIND ANY MAJOR
INFRACTIONS.</description>

      <description>HEAVIEST, STEADIEST RAIN OFF
THE SEACOAST OF NEW HAMPSHIRE.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 4:14  IS THE TIME. AN AMBITIOUS PLAN BUT FEDERAL
REGULATORS WANT TO UPDATE
TRAFFIC DEATHS ON ROADS. AND THE GOVERNMENT WANTS NEW
TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN.
. &gt;&gt; Reporter: CARS ARE GETTING
SAFER WITH ALL THE NEW
TECHNOLOGY BUT TRAFFIC DEATHS ARE SPIKING.
FEDERAL CRASH INVESTIGATORS SAY
TECHNOLOGY IN CARS RIGHT NOW WITH SAVE LIVES IF IT WERE IN
ALL VEHICLES IF DRIVERS
UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE IT. THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION
SAFETY BOARD AND THE NATIONAL
SAFETY COUNCIL IS MEETING WITH OFFICIALS AND CONSUMER SAFETY
ADVOCATE.
THEY WANT TO ELIMINATE ALL TRAFFIC DEATHS AND INJURIES IN
THE U.S. FOR THE NEXT 30 YEARS.
PRETTY LOFTY GOAL. I SPOKE TO THE DIRECTOR OF
OFFICE OF HIGHWAY SAFETY.
THEY WANT TO COMMAND FEATURES LIKE BLIND SPOT DETECTION AND
FORWARD MOTION DETECTED.
THEY HAVE THIS TECHNOLOGY IN ONE MODEL.
TYPICALLY PACKAGED AS A LUXURY
OPTION IN A HIGHER END VEHICLE. LUXURY SHOULD NOT BE AN OPTION
AND NOT ONLY AVAILABLE TO
PEOPLE THAT HAVE MONEY. MORE THAN A 10% INCREASE OF
DEATHS OVER THE SAME TIME
PERIOD IN 2015.</description>

      <description>FOX25 NEWS AT 11:00.
&gt;&gt;&gt; IT IS 4:11.
HEAD TO YOUR MAPS. PLAN TO LEAVE A FEW MINUTES
EARLY BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME
ISSUES WITH THE WEATHER. THAT ALWAYS SLOWS US DOWN ON
THE ROADS.
RIGHT NOW VERY EARLY AND NOT TOO MANY PEOPLE OUT ON THE
EXPRESSWAY.
PIKE WIDE OPEN. ROUTE 1, 93 SOUTH LOOKING GOOD.
13 MINUTES FROM ROUTE 1 FROM
128 TO THE TOBIN. 21 MINUTES ON 93 SOUTH.
24 MINUTES ON 128 SOUTHBOUND
FROM ROUTE 1 IN PEABODY TO THE WESTON TOLLS.
&gt;&gt; Daniel:  OUR METEOROLOGISTS
HAVE BEEN FORECASTING THIS AND TAKE A LOOK.
THE FIRST SIGNS OF KNOW IN
MASSACHUSETTS. A LOOK AT SPRINGFIELD.
LOOKS LIKE A WINTER WONDERLAND.
I AM SELLING YOU, SHIRI, I DON'T KNOW IF WE ARE PREPARED
FOR THIS.
&gt;&gt; Shiri:  IT'S SPRINGFIELD. &gt;&gt; Julie:  HAVEN'T SWITCHED OUT
OF THE CLOTHES.
THE. &gt;&gt; Shiri:  WORKED OUT IN
SPRINGFIELD FOR FOUR YEARS.
GOT A LOT LESS THAN HILL TOWNS IN MASSACHUSETTS.
I GOT A REPORT OF UP TO 6
INCHES OF SNOW IN ROWE. PLAINSVILLE, FIVE AND A HALF.
IN HEATH, 5.3.
WEST HAMPTON ALMOST 5 INCHES. EVEN NORTHAMPTON CLOSER TO THE
VALLEY.
THEY GET A LITTLE LESS AND ENDED UP WITH 2 INCHES OF SNOW.
SNOW.
HERE LOCALLY, JUST PLAIN RAIN. EVEN IF YOU SAW A COUPLE OF
FLAKES.
IS IT DIDN'T STICK. TRANSITION TO RAIN.
HEAVY RAIN A THREAT THIS
MORNING. SAME WITH DAMAGING WINDS AS WE
GET INTO THE AFTERNOON.
REALLY A TENDENCY TO DRY OUT. WE STILL ARE THE RISK FOR A
COUPLE OF SPOT SHOWERS AND
BREEZY CONDITIONS STAY WITH US. NOT NECESSARILY DAMAGING WINDS
BUT WINDBLOWN FRIDAY HERE.
HEAVIEST STUFF MOVING OFFSHORE. ALSO MOVING INTO PARTS OF
CENTRAL AND NORTHERN NEW
ENGLAND. AS THIS MOVES AWAY FROM US A
WHOLE SECOND SIDE OF THIS THAT
WILL PIVOT TOWARD US AND MAINTAIN THAT RISK FOR CUP OF
SPOT SHOWERS.
AS FOR RAIN TOTALS, OVER AN INCH IN BOSTON.
TODAY THESE ARE ESTIMATED RAIN
TOTALS SO FAR. NORTH SHORE, AN INCH AND A
HALF.
PARTS OF THE CAPE AN INCH AND A HALF.
SOUTHERN WORCESTER COUNTY
GETTING NAILED BY THE FUTURE RAIN.
FUTURE CAST BREAK DOWN THE NEXT
CUP OF HOURS. 6 A.M. SCATTERED RAIN.
BASED ON WHAT WE ARE SEEING
RIGHT NOW THIS IS A LITTLE OVERDONE.
A LOT OF OUR SHOWERS BY 9:00
THIS MORNING WILL BE FROM THE NORTH SHORE INTO SOUTHERN NEW
HAMPSHIRE WITH MOST OF
MASSACHUSETTS ACTUALLY SEEING SOME DRY AND PARTLY CLOUDY
CONDITIONS.
KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON CITIES NORTH OF THE PIKE AND THE
AFTERNOON.
YOU WILL SEE A COUPLE OF ADDITIONAL SHOWERS AND SOME
WILL SPILL FROM THE SOUTH SHORE
HERE. FOR THE EVENING COMMUTE LITTLE
BIT OF RAIN AROUND BUT NOTHING
LIKE WHAT WE ARE SEEING OUT HERE RIGHT NOW.
YOUR FRIDAY NIGHT PLANS, ONLY A
SLIGHT CHANCE OF A SHOWER DRYING OUT DURING THE OVERNIGHT
HOURS.
PLYMOUTH ONE OF THE WARMER LOCATIONS AT 51 DEGREES.
THE WIND IS CERTAINLY OUT THERE
TODAY. 18 MILES PER HOUR.
I AM BREAKING DOWN THESE
STRONGER GUSTS THROUGH THE MORNING BUT LOOK AT THESE
TEMPERATURES INTO THE
AFTERNOON, NOT VERY MUCH MOVEMENT.
YOU ARE BASICALLY DRESSING NOW
FOR WHAT YOU WILL FEEL ALL DAY AND MIGHT EVEN GET A LITTLE
COLDER THIS AFTERNOON.
PLYMOUTH WILL LIKELY BE ONE OF MY DRIER TOWNS DURING AFTERNOON
HOURS.
NORTHERN MASS AND SOUTHERN NEW HAMPSHIRE.
A BETTER CHANCE OF GETTING SPOT
SHOWERS EVEN INTO BOSTON. TEMPERATURES FOR THE AFTERNOON
BACK INTO THE MID- TO UPPER 40s
FOR MOST. TOMORROW, 57 IN BOSTON.
58 IN PLYMOUTH.
54 IN WORCESTER AND 56  IN NASHUA, NEW HAMPSHIRE.
TOMORROW RUNNING MOSTLY CLOUDY.
ON AND OFF CLOUDS. A LITTLE BETTER CHANCE FOR
SUNDAY SHOWERS OUT THERE.
BUT EVEN AT THAT, SPOT RAIN. HEY, WAKING UP TOMORROW
MORNING.
WE HAVE PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES. WHAT YOU WILL FIND SHOW THAT WE
HAVE THE BEST CHANCE FOR A
PASSING SHOWER HERE. NOTHING THAT LASTS VERY LONG OR
VERY HEAVY.
AREAS OF NORTH OF BOSTON AND WE GET INTO SUNDAY, AS THIS FRONT
DROPS TOWARD US ON THE WARM
SIDE MOST OF THE DAY BECAUSE IT WILL BE SO CLOSE SPAWN SOME
AFTERNOON AND EVENING RAIN HERE
ON SUNDAY. MONDAY FOR HALLOWEEN, 53 YOUR
HIGH.
WE WILL STICK WITH THE UPPER 50s ON TUESDAY AS WE BRIGHTEN
UP AND PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES ON
WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY.</description>

DISCARDED NEEDLES ARE A POINT
OF CONCERN IN BROCKTON. CITY LEADERS SAY A NONPROFIT
NEEDLE EXCHANGE IS HANDING OUT
THOUSANDS OF NEEDLES TO DRUG USERS WITHOUT COLLECTING ANY OF
THE USED ONES.
THE CEO OF THE NONPROFIT IS DEFENDING HIS AGENCIES TO
FOX25'S CATHERINE BIRCHAM.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: A COMMUNITY AGENCY THAT HELPED SO MANY FOR SO MANY
YEARS IS UNDER THE SCOPE OF
OFFICIALS. &gt;&gt; THE NEEDLE EXCHANGE A BLOCK
AND A HALF AWAY.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: CITY COUNCILLOR ANN BEAUREGARD ON A STREET
DOWNTOWN.
&gt;&gt; THERE IS A CHURCH OVER THERE.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: ALL DEVELOPMENT
THAT HAS BEEN THREATENED BY DISCARDED NEEDLES EVER SINCE
THE COKE CENTER BEGAN A FREE
NEEDLE EXCHANGE DOWN THE STREET.
&gt;&gt; IT WAS COMING ACROSS AS A
FREE-FOR HOME RUN ALL WHICH I DON'T BELIEVE WAS THE ORIGINAL
INTENT.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: EARLIER THIS WEEK BROCKTON MAYOR WROTE STAY STATE
OFFICIALS THIS LETTER SAYING
THAT THE EXCHANGE WAS NOT ONE ON ONE EXCHANGE.
EXACTLY WHAT THEY PROMISED THE
PROGRAM WOULD BE. &gt;&gt; I GOT IT WRONG.
NO PROBLEM ADMITTING THAT THEY
MADE A MISTAKE IN TERMS OF INFORMATION.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: BUT HE DENIES
CLAIM THAT THE NEEDLE EXCHANGE ADDED TO THE RAMPANT ISSUE OF
DISCARDED NEEDLES ACROSS THE
CITY THAT FOX25 FOUND IN THE CHILDREN'S PLAYGROUND.
&gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY
SCIENTIFIC WAY TO REALLY DETERMINE THAT WE HAVE
CONTRIBUTED TO THAT PROBLEM.
&gt;&gt; SIMONELL II SAY EMPLOYEES HELP PICK UP DISCARDED NEEDLES,
500 EACH WEEK.
&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE WE ARE DOING A GREAT SERVICE FOR THE CITY
WITHOUT QUESTION.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THE CITY OFFICIALS PLAN TO FURTHER QUESTION
SIMONELLI AT THEIR NEXT COUNCIL
MEETING. BUREAU GUARD WANTS TO LOOK INTO
MOVING THIS LOCATION FURTHER
AWAY FROM DOWNTOWN.</description>

      <description>EFFECTS OF TOO MUCH ADULT
BEVERAGE.
WHILE THIS POOR GUY IN CHINA HAD A LITTLE TOO MUCH TO DRINK AND
DECIDED TO GET SOME FRESH AIR --
&gt;&gt; NO. &gt;&gt; 11 STORIES UP.
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE ALL WOKEN UP IN WEIRD
PLACES, BUT WITHOUT A DOUBT THAT TAKES THE BISCUIT.
&gt;&gt; IF HE'S REALLY OUT OF IT, HE
AIN'T MOVING. &gt;&gt; NO WORD IF THIS IS EVEN HIS
APARTMENT.
A SECURITY GUARD WAS ON HIS ROUNDS AND NOTICED THE GUY
DANGLING OFF THAT LEDGE 11
STORIES UP ON THIS HIGH RISE, CALLED RESCUERS.
THEY CAME IN.
IT WASN'T AS EASY AS YOU'D THINK.
I JUST KIND OF THOUGHT, OKAY,
REACH OVER AND GRAB THE GUY. &gt;&gt; LUCKILY HE JUST FELL ASLEEP
AND DIDN'T GO OVER.
&gt;&gt; HE WAS ALSO FOUND WITH A BOTTLE OF SLEEPING PILLS AS
WELL.
SO HE REALLY MIXED UP A COCKTAIL THAT KNOCKED HIM OUT COLD.
FIREFIGHTERS ARE ASSESSING THE
SITUATION HERE. TRYING TO DETERMINE WHAT'S THE
BEST AND SAFEST WAY TO RESCUE
HIM. THEY DECIDE, WE GOT TO TAKE DOWN
THIS BALCONY.
THEY BREAK OUT THE SAWS. &gt;&gt; HE'S OUT BECAUSE HE HABIT
EVEN FLINCHED.
&gt;&gt; THEY TAKE DOWN THAT RAIL, PULL HIM IN.
CLEARLY STILL LIGHTS OUT.
SURPRISINGLY, THEY DID TAKE THE PRECAUTION OF HANDCUFFING HIM.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE WHAT IF
HE WOKE UP AND WAS SPOOKED. &gt;&gt; IF THE SAW DIDN'T WAKE HIM UP
THOUGH, I DON'T THINK ANYTHING
WOULD.</description>

      <description>THEY TOOK THE POOR GUY TO THE
HOSPITAL FOR TREATMENT.
&gt;&gt;&gt; THESE GUYS ARE ON A MISSION. A PRETTY SERIOUS MISSION.
GOING UP THIS MOUNTAIN RIGHT
HERE. THIS IS ON THE CHINESE/NEPALESE
BORDER IN THE HIMALAYAS.
ONE OF THE TALLEST MOUNTAINS IN THE WORLD.
THEY'RE WORKING THEIR WAY UP THE
SIDE. IT IS A SERIOUS PIECE OF WORK.
THIS IS AN ASCENT IN PURSUIT OF
A WORLD RECORD. A 51-YEAR-OLD EXPERT WHEN IT
COMES TO JUMPING OFF THINGS.
OUT HERE TO SET THE WORLD RAILROAD FOR THE WORLD'S HIGHEST
BASE JUMP.
NOW, USUALLY WHEN PEOPLE ARE BASE JUMPING, THEY'RE JUMPING
OFF BUILDINGS A COUPLE HUNDRED
FEET. THIS BASE JUMP WILL BE 25,250
FEET AND WILL INVOLVE 90 SECONDS
OF FREE FALL. I MEAN, YOU'RE HIGHER THAN MOST
COMMERCIAL AIRLINERS, TO BE
HONEST. &gt;&gt; THAT'S KIND OF A BUMMER.
HE HAD TO WALK.
&gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T HAVE TO WALK. IT WAS AN EXPEDITION.
IN FACT, THEY HAD TO WAIT ABOUT
A WEEK UNTIL THE WEATHER CLEARED SO IT WAS SAFE ENOUGH THEY
DIDN'T DIE IN THE ASCENT.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS THE FIRST EXIT EVER ON THIS SUMMIT.
&gt;&gt; IT'S THE TALLEST EVER.
IN FACT, HE'S BREAKING HIS OWN RECORD BY OVER A THOUSAND FEET.
HE'S NO STRANGER TO THINGS LIKE
THIS. HE'S JUMPED OFF KILIMANJARO.
HE'S SKY DIVED INTO A VOLCANO.
THIS GUY'S GOT EXPERIENCE. HERE'S ONE MORE.
&gt;&gt; DUDE, KEEP GOING, MAN.
KEEP FLYING ALL THE WAY DOWN. NOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO HIKE DOWN.
ALL YOUR BUDDIES ARE LIKE, COME
ON. &gt;&gt; IT'S JUST THE KIND OF THING
YOU SOME TO EXPECT WHEN WE HAVE
A VIDEO FROM RED BULL.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt; THAT'S INCREDIBLE.
&gt;&gt;&gt; SOUNDS LAKE SOMETHING IS
DYING, BUT IT'S ACTUALLY A COCKATOO.
LET'S SEE IF I CAN FIND IT.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S A ZOOLOGY Ph.D. STUDENT WALKING THROUGH THE
STREETS OF MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA.
HE WANTS YOU TO HEAR THE SOUNDS COMING FROM SOME COCKATOOS UP IN
THE TREE.
&gt;&gt; THEY'RE REALLY WHITE PARROTS WITH A MOHAWK.
&gt;&gt; BUT WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IS
COMPLETELY UNEXPECTED. &gt;&gt; HOLY CRAP.
THERE'S A POSSUM UP HERE
ATTACKING THIS BIRD. &gt;&gt; ACTUALLY, THE POSSUM WAS
ATTACKED BY A PAIR OF COCKATOOS.
AND THE POSSUM IS ABOUT TO GET A CAN OF WHOOPING PUT ALL OVER
HIM.
ONE ANIMAL EXPERT DOES BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS A HOLLOW PROBABLY
IN THAT TREE, AND BECAUSE IT'S
DAYTIME AND THIS NOCTURNAL ANIMAL IS OUT, THEY THINK IT
MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN A HALLOW THAT
THE COCKATOOS WANTED TO BE IN AND THE FACT WAS ON.
&gt;&gt; MAN, YOU CAN'T JUST CATCH A
NAP. &gt;&gt; AFTER A WHILE, PETE JUST
STROLLS AWAY TO DO HIS GROCERY
SHOPPING. THEN HE COMES BACK, AND THE
DRAMA GETS A LITTLE CLOSER.
UH-OH. THE COCKATOOS HAVE COME OUT OF
THE TREE BECAUSE THEY CHASED THE
POSSUM DOWN. &gt;&gt; PUNKS.
&gt;&gt; OH, YEAH.
AND I FEEL BAD FOR THE POSSUM. WE FINALLY GET A LOOK AT WHAT'S
GOING ON WITH THAT CREATURE.
&gt;&gt; THERE HE IS. WHOA.
HI, CUTIE PIE.
&gt;&gt; IT IS ABSOLUTELY CUTE BUT STUCK UNDER THE CAR BECAUSE OF
THOSE COCKATOOS WHO WEREN'T
HAPPY ABOUT SHARING TERRITORY. THIS IS HOW TURF WARS START.
THE POSSUM IS GOING TO GO BACK
AND TELL HIS HOMIES AND THEN</description>

&gt;&gt; YOU MIGHT WANT TO FIND
SOMEONE OLDER. &gt;&gt; SO HE DOES.
&gt;&gt; I GOT A BABY IN THE BATHROOM.
&gt;&gt; NOBODY SEEMS TO QUESTION HIM ABOUT WHY HE LEFT THE BABY IN
THE BATHROOM.
&gt;&gt; PUT THE BABY ON ONE SIDE. &gt;&gt; I'M MORE CONFUSED!
&gt;&gt; LET'S GO TO QUESTION NUMBER
TWO. &gt;&gt; I'M WATCHING MY FRIEND'S KID
FOR LIKE THE NEXT THREE TO FOUR
DAYS. &gt;&gt; YOU NEED TO DISCIPLINE THAT
CHILD.
HOW DO YOU DO IT? &gt;&gt; LOCK HIM IN THE BATHROOM.
&gt;&gt; HOW ABOUT INSTEAD OF FOCUSING
ON THE DISCIPLINE ASPECT OF IT, YOU KIND OF LOOK AT WHAT'S GOOD
IN THE KID.
THEN YOU TRY TO -- BECAUSE THE KID IS ACTING UP FOR A REASON.
&gt;&gt; THIS GUY IS WISE.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S GOOD ADVICE. ALL RIGHT.
I'M GOING TO TRY THAT OUT.
&gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT YOU GOT GREAT CONCERT TICKETS, BUT YOU GOT TO
WORK TONIGHT.
WHAT DO YOU DO TO GET OUT OF WORK?
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW HOW TO CALL IN
SICK. &gt;&gt; SAY YOU HAVE A BAD FLU.
&gt;&gt; OKAY.
&gt;&gt; NOBODY WANTS THE FLU AT WORK. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING TO GET CAUGHT.
IF YOU LIE ABOUT BEING SICK AND
YOU'RE SHARING AND SNAPPING ABOUT BEING AN THIS CONCERT,
HE'S GOING TO GET FIRED.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S WHERE YOU WIND UP HOSING YOURSELF.
&gt;&gt; YOU JUST GAVE ME SO MUCH GOOD
[ BLEEP ], MAN. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN ASK STRANGERS FOR
ADVICE, BUT YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt; WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.
&gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE WHAT HAPPENED TO
YOUR POOR MOTHER. &gt;&gt; YEAH, NO.
&gt;&gt; THE GREAT PUMPKIN SCARE.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS THE OBLIGATORY MOMENT WHERE THE BLACK PERSON SAYS
DON'T GO IN THERE.
&gt;&gt; IT'S BASED ON THE COMIC AND A TERRIBLE UNSEEN THREAT THAT'S
JUST THERE TO SCARE THE PANTS
OFF YOU BASICALLY. THE SHOW IS CREATED BY THE
CREATOR OF A COMIC BOOK SERIES
CALLED "THE WALKING DEAD." YOU HEARD ABOUT THIS?
&gt;&gt; SOUNDS FAMILIAR.
&gt;&gt; MADE INTO A TV SHOW OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
THE THING IS THERE IS SOME
PRETTY INTERESTING NEWS COMING OUR WAY.
FOR ANYBODY AT HOME THAT HASN'T
HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE "OUTCAST," HOW WOULD YOU BOIL IT
DOWN?
&gt;&gt; DEFINITELY A HORROR SHOW. IT FOCUSES ON KYLE BARNS, WHO
LIVES IN A SMALL TOWN IN WEST
VIRGINIA. HE'S BEEN PLAGUED BY DEMONIC
POSSESSION HIS ENTIRE LIFE, BUT
HE LEARNS HE HAS SOME POWERS THAT ACTUALLY AFFECT PEOPLE THAT
ARE POSSESSED BY DEMONS.
HE KIND OF SETS OUT ON THIS JOURNEY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE
INS AND OUTS OF THIS PHENOMENON
ACTUALLY ARE AND TO SEE IF HE CAN SOLVE IT.
I FEEL LIKE IT'S THE FIRST STORY
THAT EVER TREATED DEMONIC POSSESSION LIKE A SOLVABLE
PROBLEM, WHICH IS SOMETHING I'M
EXCITED ABOUT. &gt;&gt; WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL WITH
HALLOWEEN?
&gt;&gt; YEAH, HALLOWEEN, OCTOBER 31st, "OUTCAST" IS GOING TO BE
AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD ON
iTUNES. SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE CINEMAX,
YOU CAN GET IT ON iTUNES AND
BINGE WATCH THAT THING. &gt;&gt; DO YOU HAVE TO CHANNEL
ANYTHING?
&gt;&gt; NO, NO. HOPEFULLY NOT.
THAT'S ABOVE AND BEYOND THE CALL
OF DUTY. I'M JUST SITTING AT A KEYBOARD
WRITING A BOOK.
I DON'T NEED TO BE ENGAGING ME LIFE.
&gt;&gt; IS THERE ANY WORD ABOUT A
SEASON TWO? &gt;&gt; WE'RE FILMING SEASON TWO AS
WE SPEAK.
I'M ON SET IN SOUTH CAROLINA. WE'LL BE BACK IN 2017 WITH A
BUNCH OF NEW EPISODES.
&gt;&gt; WE GOT TO TALK ABOUT IT. THE ENTIRE WORLD HAS LOST THEIR
MIND WITH THE SEASON SEVEN
PREMIERE OF "WALKING DEAD." HOW DOES IT FEEL TO HAVE THAT
KIND OF EMOTIONAL CONNECTION
FROM YOUR AUDIENCE? &gt;&gt; PRETTY GOOD.
PRETTY GOOD.
IT'S REALLY GRATIFYING. I KNOW THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE
UPSET ABOUT THE EVENTS.
THAT'S BY DESIGN. WE EXPECTED PEOPLE TO BE UPSET.
THESE ARE BELOVED CHARACTERS
WE'RE LETTING GO OF. TO KNOW THE REACTION HAS BEEN
THAT HUGE AND TO SEE EVERYBODY
STILL LOVES THE SHOW IS REALLY GRATIFYING.
&gt;&gt; ROBERT, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
TAKING THE TIME TO TALK TO US.</description>

GOES SLIDING DOWN THE HILL. &gt;&gt; WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS?
&gt;&gt; THEY WERE BEING CREATIVE.
&gt;&gt; THEY DID SOMETHING DIFFERENT ALL RIGHT.

IT'S YOUR TURN TO WALK INTO THE
RECEPTION HALL, YOU GOT TO DO A LITTLE UH, UH, UH.

HE GOES TO PICK HER UP. I THINK YOU KNOW WHERE THIS IS
GOING.
AND THEY FALL. &gt;&gt; WOW, DUDE.
COME ON.
&gt;&gt; OH, GOODNESS ME. &gt;&gt; HE LANDS RIGHT ON TOP OF HER.
HE DID GET HER UP EVENTUALLY.

âªâª
&gt;&gt; BOATER. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO CALL BULL.
&gt;&gt; HE'S GOT MAD SKILLS.
THIS IS ALMOST OBNOXIOUS HOW GOOD THIS GUY IS.
&gt;&gt; HE'S NOT DRESSED LIKE A
COWBOY. IT'S LIKE HE'S JUST COME FROM
WORK.
&gt;&gt; HE GOES DOWN, MOUNTS THE BULL, STANDS BACK UP, DROPS IT
AGAIN.
&gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE DATE NIGHT. &gt;&gt; DO WE HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON
THIS GUY?
DOES HE WORK AT THIS BAR AND HE'S JUST TRAINED UP FOR IT?
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT HIM?
&gt;&gt; HE'S THE WORLD BULL DANCING CHAMPION.
&gt;&gt; ALL WE KNOW IS HIS NAME IS
ANTHONY, AND HE VISITED THE PROFESSIONAL BULL RIDERS IN

      <description>EFFECTS OF TOO MUCH ADULT
BEVERAGE.
WHILE THIS POOR GUY IN CHINA HAD A LITTLE TOO MUCH TO DRINK AND
DECIDED TO GET SOME FRESH AIR --
&gt;&gt; NO. &gt;&gt; 11 STORIES UP.
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE ALL WOKEN UP IN WEIRD
PLACES, BUT WITHOUT A DOUBT THAT TAKES THE BISCUIT.
&gt;&gt; IF HE'S REALLY OUT OF IT, HE
AIN'T MOVING. &gt;&gt; NO WORD IF THIS IS EVEN HIS
APARTMENT.
A SECURITY GUARD WAS ON HIS ROUNDS AND NOTICED THE GUY
DANGLING OFF THAT LEDGE 11
STORIES UP ON THIS HIGH RISE, CALLED RESCUERS.
THEY CAME IN.
IT WASN'T AS EASY AS YOU'D THINK.
I JUST KIND OF THOUGHT, OKAY,
REACH OVER AND GRAB THE GUY. &gt;&gt; LUCKILY HE JUST FELL ASLEEP
AND DIDN'T GO OVER.
&gt;&gt; HE WAS ALSO FOUND WITH A BOTTLE OF SLEEPING PILLS AS
WELL.
SO HE REALLY MIXED UP A COCKTAIL THAT KNOCKED HIM OUT COLD.
FIREFIGHTERS ARE ASSESSING THE
SITUATION HERE. TRYING TO DETERMINE WHAT'S THE
BEST AND SAFEST WAY TO RESCUE
HIM. THEY DECIDE, WE GOT TO TAKE DOWN
THIS BALCONY.
THEY BREAK OUT THE SAWS. &gt;&gt; HE'S OUT BECAUSE HE HABIT
EVEN FLINCHED.
&gt;&gt; THEY TAKE DOWN THAT RAIL, PULL HIM IN.
CLEARLY STILL LIGHTS OUT.
SURPRISINGLY, THEY DID TAKE THE PRECAUTION OF HANDCUFFING HIM.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE WHAT IF
HE WOKE UP AND WAS SPOOKED. &gt;&gt; IF THE SAW DIDN'T WAKE HIM UP
THOUGH, I DON'T THINK ANYTHING
WOULD.</description>

THIS IS AN ASCENT IN PURSUIT OF
A WORLD RECORD. A 51-YEAR-OLD EXPERT WHEN IT
COMES TO JUMPING OFF THINGS.
OUT HERE TO SET THE WORLD RAILROAD FOR THE WORLD'S HIGHEST
BASE JUMP.
NOW, USUALLY WHEN PEOPLE ARE BASE JUMPING, THEY'RE JUMPING
OFF BUILDINGS A COUPLE HUNDRED
FEET. THIS BASE JUMP WILL BE 25,250
FEET AND WILL INVOLVE 90 SECONDS
OF FREE FALL. I MEAN, YOU'RE HIGHER THAN MOST
COMMERCIAL AIRLINERS, TO BE
HONEST. &gt;&gt; THAT'S KIND OF A BUMMER.
HE HAD TO WALK.
&gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T HAVE TO WALK. IT WAS AN EXPEDITION.
IN FACT, THEY HAD TO WAIT ABOUT
A WEEK UNTIL THE WEATHER CLEARED SO IT WAS SAFE ENOUGH THEY
DIDN'T DIE IN THE ASCENT.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS THE FIRST EXIT EVER ON THIS SUMMIT.
&gt;&gt; IT'S THE TALLEST EVER.
IN FACT, HE'S BREAKING HIS OWN RECORD BY OVER A THOUSAND FEET.
HE'S NO STRANGER TO THINGS LIKE
THIS. HE'S JUMPED OFF KILIMANJARO.
HE'S SKY DIVED INTO A VOLCANO.
THIS GUY'S GOT EXPERIENCE. HERE'S ONE MORE.
&gt;&gt; DUDE, KEEP GOING, MAN.
KEEP FLYING ALL THE WAY DOWN. NOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO HIKE DOWN.
ALL YOUR BUDDIES ARE LIKE, COME
ON. &gt;&gt; IT'S JUST THE KIND OF THING
YOU SOME TO EXPECT WHEN WE HAVE
A VIDEO FROM RED BULL.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt; THAT'S INCREDIBLE.
&gt;&gt;&gt; SOUNDS LAKE SOMETHING IS
DYING, BUT IT'S ACTUALLY A COCKATOO.
LET'S SEE IF I CAN FIND IT.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S A ZOOLOGY Ph.D. STUDENT WALKING THROUGH THE
STREETS OF MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA.
HE WANTS YOU TO HEAR THE SOUNDS COMING FROM SOME COCKATOOS UP IN
THE TREE.
&gt;&gt; THEY'RE REALLY WHITE PARROTS WITH A MOHAWK.
&gt;&gt; BUT WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IS
COMPLETELY UNEXPECTED. &gt;&gt; HOLY CRAP.
THERE'S A POSSUM UP HERE
ATTACKING THIS BIRD. &gt;&gt; ACTUALLY, THE POSSUM WAS
ATTACKED BY A PAIR OF COCKATOOS.
AND THE POSSUM IS ABOUT TO GET A CAN OF WHOOPING PUT ALL OVER
HIM.
ONE ANIMAL EXPERT DOES BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS A HOLLOW PROBABLY
IN THAT TREE, AND BECAUSE IT'S
DAYTIME AND THIS NOCTURNAL ANIMAL IS OUT, THEY THINK IT
MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN A HALLOW THAT
THE COCKATOOS WANTED TO BE IN AND THE FACT WAS ON.
&gt;&gt; MAN, YOU CAN'T JUST CATCH A
NAP. &gt;&gt; AFTER A WHILE, PETE JUST
STROLLS AWAY TO DO HIS GROCERY
SHOPPING. THEN HE COMES BACK, AND THE
DRAMA GETS A LITTLE CLOSER.
UH-OH. THE COCKATOOS HAVE COME OUT OF
THE TREE BECAUSE THEY CHASED THE
POSSUM DOWN. &gt;&gt; PUNKS.
&gt;&gt; OH, YEAH.
AND I FEEL BAD FOR THE POSSUM. WE FINALLY GET A LOOK AT WHAT'S
GOING ON WITH THAT CREATURE.
&gt;&gt; THERE HE IS. WHOA.
HI, CUTIE PIE.
&gt;&gt; IT IS ABSOLUTELY CUTE BUT STUCK UNDER THE CAR BECAUSE OF
THOSE COCKATOOS WHO WEREN'T
HAPPY ABOUT SHARING TERRITORY. THIS IS HOW TURF WARS START.
THE POSSUM IS GOING TO GO BACK
AND TELL HIS HOMIES AND THEN</description>

      <description>FIRST QUESTION --
&gt;&gt; I GOT A BABY IN THE BATHROOM
RIGHT NOW. I HAD TO RUN OUT BECAUSE I DON'T
KNOW HOW TO CHANGE A DIAPER.
&gt;&gt; THIS GIRL, PRICELESS. &gt;&gt; HOW DO YOU CHANGE A DIAPER?
&gt;&gt; I CAN'T EXPLAIN THAT.
&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU DO? &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW.
&gt;&gt; YOU'VE NEVER CHANGED A BABY'S
DIAPER? &gt;&gt; NO.
&gt;&gt; YOU MIGHT WANT TO FIND
SOMEONE OLDER. &gt;&gt; SO HE DOES.
&gt;&gt; I GOT A BABY IN THE BATHROOM.
&gt;&gt; NOBODY SEEMS TO QUESTION HIM ABOUT WHY HE LEFT THE BABY IN
THE BATHROOM.
&gt;&gt; PUT THE BABY ON ONE SIDE. &gt;&gt; I'M MORE CONFUSED!
&gt;&gt; LET'S GO TO QUESTION NUMBER
TWO. &gt;&gt; I'M WATCHING MY FRIEND'S KID
FOR LIKE THE NEXT THREE TO FOUR
DAYS. &gt;&gt; YOU NEED TO DISCIPLINE THAT
CHILD.
HOW DO YOU DO IT? &gt;&gt; LOCK HIM IN THE BATHROOM.
&gt;&gt; HOW ABOUT INSTEAD OF FOCUSING
ON THE DISCIPLINE ASPECT OF IT, YOU KIND OF LOOK AT WHAT'S GOOD
IN THE KID.
THEN YOU TRY TO -- BECAUSE THE KID IS ACTING UP FOR A REASON.
&gt;&gt; THIS GUY IS WISE.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S GOOD ADVICE. ALL RIGHT.
I'M GOING TO TRY THAT OUT.
&gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT YOU GOT GREAT CONCERT TICKETS, BUT YOU GOT TO
WORK TONIGHT.
WHAT DO YOU DO TO GET OUT OF WORK?
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW HOW TO CALL IN
SICK. &gt;&gt; SAY YOU HAVE A BAD FLU.
&gt;&gt; OKAY.
&gt;&gt; NOBODY WANTS THE FLU AT WORK. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING TO GET CAUGHT.
IF YOU LIE ABOUT BEING SICK AND
YOU'RE SHARING AND SNAPPING ABOUT BEING AN THIS CONCERT,
HE'S GOING TO GET FIRED.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S WHERE YOU WIND UP HOSING YOURSELF.
&gt;&gt; YOU JUST GAVE ME SO MUCH GOOD
[ BLEEP ], MAN. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN ASK STRANGERS FOR
ADVICE, BUT YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt; WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.
&gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE WHAT HAPPENED TO
YOUR POOR MOTHER. &gt;&gt; YEAH, NO.
&gt;&gt; THE GREAT PUMPKIN SCARE.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS THE OBLIGATORY MOMENT WHERE THE BLACK PERSON SAYS
DON'T GO IN THERE.
&gt;&gt; IT'S BASED ON THE COMIC AND A TERRIBLE UNSEEN THREAT THAT'S
JUST THERE TO SCARE THE PANTS
OFF YOU BASICALLY. THE SHOW IS CREATED BY THE
CREATOR OF A COMIC BOOK SERIES
CALLED "THE WALKING DEAD." YOU HEARD ABOUT THIS?
&gt;&gt; SOUNDS FAMILIAR.
&gt;&gt; MADE INTO A TV SHOW OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
THE THING IS THERE IS SOME
PRETTY INTERESTING NEWS COMING OUR WAY.
FOR ANYBODY AT HOME THAT HASN'T
HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE "OUTCAST," HOW WOULD YOU BOIL IT
DOWN?
&gt;&gt; DEFINITELY A HORROR SHOW. IT FOCUSES ON KYLE BARNS, WHO
LIVES IN A SMALL TOWN IN WEST
VIRGINIA. HE'S BEEN PLAGUED BY DEMONIC
POSSESSION HIS ENTIRE LIFE, BUT
HE LEARNS HE HAS SOME POWERS THAT ACTUALLY AFFECT PEOPLE THAT
ARE POSSESSED BY DEMONS.
HE KIND OF SETS OUT ON THIS JOURNEY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE
INS AND OUTS OF THIS PHENOMENON
ACTUALLY ARE AND TO SEE IF HE CAN SOLVE IT.
I FEEL LIKE IT'S THE FIRST STORY
THAT EVER TREATED DEMONIC POSSESSION LIKE A SOLVABLE
PROBLEM, WHICH IS SOMETHING I'M
EXCITED ABOUT. &gt;&gt; WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL WITH
HALLOWEEN?
&gt;&gt; YEAH, HALLOWEEN, OCTOBER 31st, "OUTCAST" IS GOING TO BE
AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD ON
iTUNES. SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE CINEMAX,
YOU CAN GET IT ON iTUNES AND
BINGE WATCH THAT THING. &gt;&gt; DO YOU HAVE TO CHANNEL
ANYTHING?
&gt;&gt; NO, NO. HOPEFULLY NOT.
THAT'S ABOVE AND BEYOND THE CALL
OF DUTY. I'M JUST SITTING AT A KEYBOARD
WRITING A BOOK.
I DON'T NEED TO BE ENGAGING ME LIFE.
&gt;&gt; IS THERE ANY WORD ABOUT A
SEASON TWO? &gt;&gt; WE'RE FILMING SEASON TWO AS
WE SPEAK.
I'M ON SET IN SOUTH CAROLINA. WE'LL BE BACK IN 2017 WITH A
BUNCH OF NEW EPISODES.
&gt;&gt; WE GOT TO TALK ABOUT IT. THE ENTIRE WORLD HAS LOST THEIR
MIND WITH THE SEASON SEVEN
PREMIERE OF "WALKING DEAD." HOW DOES IT FEEL TO HAVE THAT
KIND OF EMOTIONAL CONNECTION
FROM YOUR AUDIENCE? &gt;&gt; PRETTY GOOD.
PRETTY GOOD.
IT'S REALLY GRATIFYING. I KNOW THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE
UPSET ABOUT THE EVENTS.
THAT'S BY DESIGN. WE EXPECTED PEOPLE TO BE UPSET.
THESE ARE BELOVED CHARACTERS
WE'RE LETTING GO OF. TO KNOW THE REACTION HAS BEEN
THAT HUGE AND TO SEE EVERYBODY
STILL LOVES THE SHOW IS REALLY GRATIFYING.
&gt;&gt; ROBERT, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
TAKING THE TIME TO TALK TO US.</description>

THIS BRIDE AND GROOM ARE TAKING
PICTURES. &gt;&gt; OH, OH, OH!
&gt;&gt; SUDDENLY SHE FLIPS AND DOES
THE SPLITS ON THE RAIL. BUT FROM THERE, IT GETS WORSE.
HE GOES TO KICK THE RAIL AND HE
GOES SLIDING DOWN THE HILL. &gt;&gt; WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS?
&gt;&gt; THEY WERE BEING CREATIVE.
&gt;&gt; THEY DID SOMETHING DIFFERENT ALL RIGHT.

IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN A PART OF A WEDDING PARTY, YOU KNOW WHEN
IT'S YOUR TURN TO WALK INTO THE
RECEPTION HALL, YOU GOT TO DO A LITTLE UH, UH, UH.
&gt;&gt; THE DEEJAY ANNOUNCES THEM.
HE GOES TO PICK HER UP. I THINK YOU KNOW WHERE THIS IS
GOING.

COME ON.
&gt;&gt; OH, GOODNESS ME. &gt;&gt; HE LANDS RIGHT ON TOP OF HER.
HE DID GET HER UP EVENTUALLY.

      <description>&gt;&gt; IS HE BACKWARDS?
HE'S BACKWARDS ON THE THING.
&gt;&gt; HE IS, ACTUALLY. THE BULL IS STARTING TO --
âªâª
&gt;&gt; BOATER. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO CALL BULL.
&gt;&gt; HE'S GOT MAD SKILLS.
THIS IS ALMOST OBNOXIOUS HOW GOOD THIS GUY IS.
&gt;&gt; HE'S NOT DRESSED LIKE A
COWBOY. IT'S LIKE HE'S JUST COME FROM
WORK.
&gt;&gt; HE GOES DOWN, MOUNTS THE BULL, STANDS BACK UP, DROPS IT
AGAIN.
&gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE DATE NIGHT. &gt;&gt; DO WE HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON
THIS GUY?
DOES HE WORK AT THIS BAR AND HE'S JUST TRAINED UP FOR IT?
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT HIM?
&gt;&gt; HE'S THE WORLD BULL DANCING CHAMPION.
&gt;&gt; ALL WE KNOW IS HIS NAME IS
ANTHONY, AND HE VISITED THE PROFESSIONAL BULL RIDERS IN
HAMPTON, VIRGINIA.
THAT'S IT. HE MUST BE -- HE MUST HAVE DONE
THIS BEFORE.

      <description>EFFECTS OF TOO MUCH ADULT
BEVERAGE.
WHILE THIS POOR GUY IN CHINA HAD A LITTLE TOO MUCH TO DRINK AND
DECIDED TO GET SOME FRESH AIR --
&gt;&gt; NO. &gt;&gt; 11 STORIES UP.
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE ALL WOKEN UP IN WEIRD
PLACES, BUT WITHOUT A DOUBT THAT TAKES THE BISCUIT.
&gt;&gt; IF HE'S REALLY OUT OF IT, HE
AIN'T MOVING. &gt;&gt; NO WORD IF THIS IS EVEN HIS
APARTMENT.
A SECURITY GUARD WAS ON HIS ROUNDS AND NOTICED THE GUY
DANGLING OFF THAT LEDGE 11
STORIES UP ON THIS HIGH RISE, CALLED RESCUERS.
THEY CAME IN.
IT WASN'T AS EASY AS YOU'D THINK.
I JUST KIND OF THOUGHT, OKAY,
REACH OVER AND GRAB THE GUY. &gt;&gt; LUCKILY HE JUST FELL ASLEEP
AND DIDN'T GO OVER.
&gt;&gt; HE WAS ALSO FOUND WITH A BOTTLE OF SLEEPING PILLS AS
WELL.
SO HE REALLY MIXED UP A COCKTAIL THAT KNOCKED HIM OUT COLD.
FIREFIGHTERS ARE ASSESSING THE
SITUATION HERE. TRYING TO DETERMINE WHAT'S THE
BEST AND SAFEST WAY TO RESCUE
HIM. THEY DECIDE, WE GOT TO TAKE DOWN
THIS BALCONY.
THEY BREAK OUT THE SAWS. &gt;&gt; HE'S OUT BECAUSE HE HABIT
EVEN FLINCHED.
&gt;&gt; THEY TAKE DOWN THAT RAIL, PULL HIM IN.
CLEARLY STILL LIGHTS OUT.
SURPRISINGLY, THEY DID TAKE THE PRECAUTION OF HANDCUFFING HIM.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE WHAT IF
HE WOKE UP AND WAS SPOOKED. &gt;&gt; IF THE SAW DIDN'T WAKE HIM UP
THOUGH, I DON'T THINK ANYTHING
WOULD.</description>

      <description>THEY TOOK THE POOR GUY TO THE
HOSPITAL FOR TREATMENT.
&gt;&gt;&gt; THESE GUYS ARE ON A MISSION. A PRETTY SERIOUS MISSION.
GOING UP THIS MOUNTAIN RIGHT
HERE. THIS IS ON THE CHINESE/NEPALESE
BORDER IN THE HIMALAYAS.
ONE OF THE TALLEST MOUNTAINS IN THE WORLD.
THEY'RE WORKING THEIR WAY UP THE
SIDE. IT IS A SERIOUS PIECE OF WORK.
THIS IS AN ASCENT IN PURSUIT OF
A WORLD RECORD. A 51-YEAR-OLD EXPERT WHEN IT
COMES TO JUMPING OFF THINGS.
OUT HERE TO SET THE WORLD RAILROAD FOR THE WORLD'S HIGHEST
BASE JUMP.
NOW, USUALLY WHEN PEOPLE ARE BASE JUMPING, THEY'RE JUMPING
OFF BUILDINGS A COUPLE HUNDRED
FEET. THIS BASE JUMP WILL BE 25,250
FEET AND WILL INVOLVE 90 SECONDS
OF FREE FALL. I MEAN, YOU'RE HIGHER THAN MOST
COMMERCIAL AIRLINERS, TO BE
HONEST. &gt;&gt; THAT'S KIND OF A BUMMER.
HE HAD TO WALK.
&gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T HAVE TO WALK. IT WAS AN EXPEDITION.
IN FACT, THEY HAD TO WAIT ABOUT
A WEEK UNTIL THE WEATHER CLEARED SO IT WAS SAFE ENOUGH THEY
DIDN'T DIE IN THE ASCENT.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS THE FIRST EXIT EVER ON THIS SUMMIT.
&gt;&gt; IT'S THE TALLEST EVER.
IN FACT, HE'S BREAKING HIS OWN RECORD BY OVER A THOUSAND FEET.
HE'S NO STRANGER TO THINGS LIKE
THIS. HE'S JUMPED OFF KILIMANJARO.
HE'S SKY DIVED INTO A VOLCANO.
THIS GUY'S GOT EXPERIENCE. HERE'S ONE MORE.
&gt;&gt; DUDE, KEEP GOING, MAN.
KEEP FLYING ALL THE WAY DOWN. NOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO HIKE DOWN.
ALL YOUR BUDDIES ARE LIKE, COME
ON. &gt;&gt; IT'S JUST THE KIND OF THING
YOU SOME TO EXPECT WHEN WE HAVE
A VIDEO FROM RED BULL.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt; THAT'S INCREDIBLE.
&gt;&gt;&gt; SOUNDS LAKE SOMETHING IS
DYING, BUT IT'S ACTUALLY A COCKATOO.
LET'S SEE IF I CAN FIND IT.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S A ZOOLOGY Ph.D. STUDENT WALKING THROUGH THE
STREETS OF MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA.
HE WANTS YOU TO HEAR THE SOUNDS COMING FROM SOME COCKATOOS UP IN
THE TREE.
&gt;&gt; THEY'RE REALLY WHITE PARROTS WITH A MOHAWK.
&gt;&gt; BUT WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IS
COMPLETELY UNEXPECTED. &gt;&gt; HOLY CRAP.
THERE'S A POSSUM UP HERE
ATTACKING THIS BIRD. &gt;&gt; ACTUALLY, THE POSSUM WAS
ATTACKED BY A PAIR OF COCKATOOS.
AND THE POSSUM IS ABOUT TO GET A CAN OF WHOOPING PUT ALL OVER
HIM.
ONE ANIMAL EXPERT DOES BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS A HOLLOW PROBABLY
IN THAT TREE, AND BECAUSE IT'S
DAYTIME AND THIS NOCTURNAL ANIMAL IS OUT, THEY THINK IT
MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN A HALLOW THAT
THE COCKATOOS WANTED TO BE IN AND THE FACT WAS ON.
&gt;&gt; MAN, YOU CAN'T JUST CATCH A
NAP. &gt;&gt; AFTER A WHILE, PETE JUST
STROLLS AWAY TO DO HIS GROCERY
SHOPPING. THEN HE COMES BACK, AND THE
DRAMA GETS A LITTLE CLOSER.
UH-OH. THE COCKATOOS HAVE COME OUT OF
THE TREE BECAUSE THEY CHASED THE
POSSUM DOWN. &gt;&gt; PUNKS.
&gt;&gt; OH, YEAH.
AND I FEEL BAD FOR THE POSSUM. WE FINALLY GET A LOOK AT WHAT'S
GOING ON WITH THAT CREATURE.
&gt;&gt; THERE HE IS. WHOA.
HI, CUTIE PIE.
&gt;&gt; IT IS ABSOLUTELY CUTE BUT STUCK UNDER THE CAR BECAUSE OF
THOSE COCKATOOS WHO WEREN'T
HAPPY ABOUT SHARING TERRITORY. THIS IS HOW TURF WARS START.
THE POSSUM IS GOING TO GO BACK
AND TELL HIS HOMIES AND THEN</description>

      <description>FIRST QUESTION --
&gt;&gt; I GOT A BABY IN THE BATHROOM
RIGHT NOW. I HAD TO RUN OUT BECAUSE I DON'T
KNOW HOW TO CHANGE A DIAPER.
&gt;&gt; THIS GIRL, PRICELESS. &gt;&gt; HOW DO YOU CHANGE A DIAPER?
&gt;&gt; I CAN'T EXPLAIN THAT.
&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU DO? &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW.
&gt;&gt; YOU'VE NEVER CHANGED A BABY'S
DIAPER? &gt;&gt; NO.
&gt;&gt; YOU MIGHT WANT TO FIND
SOMEONE OLDER. &gt;&gt; SO HE DOES.
&gt;&gt; I GOT A BABY IN THE BATHROOM.
&gt;&gt; NOBODY SEEMS TO QUESTION HIM ABOUT WHY HE LEFT THE BABY IN
THE BATHROOM.
&gt;&gt; PUT THE BABY ON ONE SIDE. &gt;&gt; I'M MORE CONFUSED!
&gt;&gt; LET'S GO TO QUESTION NUMBER
TWO. &gt;&gt; I'M WATCHING MY FRIEND'S KID
FOR LIKE THE NEXT THREE TO FOUR
DAYS. &gt;&gt; YOU NEED TO DISCIPLINE THAT
CHILD.
HOW DO YOU DO IT? &gt;&gt; LOCK HIM IN THE BATHROOM.
&gt;&gt; HOW ABOUT INSTEAD OF FOCUSING
ON THE DISCIPLINE ASPECT OF IT, YOU KIND OF LOOK AT WHAT'S GOOD
IN THE KID.
THEN YOU TRY TO -- BECAUSE THE KID IS ACTING UP FOR A REASON.
&gt;&gt; THIS GUY IS WISE.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S GOOD ADVICE. ALL RIGHT.
I'M GOING TO TRY THAT OUT.
&gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT YOU GOT GREAT CONCERT TICKETS, BUT YOU GOT TO
WORK TONIGHT.
WHAT DO YOU DO TO GET OUT OF WORK?
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW HOW TO CALL IN
SICK. &gt;&gt; SAY YOU HAVE A BAD FLU.
&gt;&gt; OKAY.
&gt;&gt; NOBODY WANTS THE FLU AT WORK. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING TO GET CAUGHT.
IF YOU LIE ABOUT BEING SICK AND
YOU'RE SHARING AND SNAPPING ABOUT BEING AN THIS CONCERT,
HE'S GOING TO GET FIRED.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S WHERE YOU WIND UP HOSING YOURSELF.
&gt;&gt; YOU JUST GAVE ME SO MUCH GOOD
[ BLEEP ], MAN. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN ASK STRANGERS FOR
ADVICE, BUT YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt; WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.
&gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE WHAT HAPPENED TO
YOUR POOR MOTHER. &gt;&gt; YEAH, NO.
&gt;&gt; THE GREAT PUMPKIN SCARE.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS THE OBLIGATORY MOMENT WHERE THE BLACK PERSON SAYS
DON'T GO IN THERE.
&gt;&gt; IT'S BASED ON THE COMIC AND A TERRIBLE UNSEEN THREAT THAT'S
JUST THERE TO SCARE THE PANTS
OFF YOU BASICALLY. THE SHOW IS CREATED BY THE
CREATOR OF A COMIC BOOK SERIES
CALLED "THE WALKING DEAD." YOU HEARD ABOUT THIS?
&gt;&gt; SOUNDS FAMILIAR.
&gt;&gt; MADE INTO A TV SHOW OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
THE THING IS THERE IS SOME
PRETTY INTERESTING NEWS COMING OUR WAY.
FOR ANYBODY AT HOME THAT HASN'T
HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE "OUTCAST," HOW WOULD YOU BOIL IT
DOWN?
&gt;&gt; DEFINITELY A HORROR SHOW. IT FOCUSES ON KYLE BARNS, WHO
LIVES IN A SMALL TOWN IN WEST
VIRGINIA. HE'S BEEN PLAGUED BY DEMONIC
POSSESSION HIS ENTIRE LIFE, BUT
HE LEARNS HE HAS SOME POWERS THAT ACTUALLY AFFECT PEOPLE THAT
ARE POSSESSED BY DEMONS.
HE KIND OF SETS OUT ON THIS JOURNEY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE
INS AND OUTS OF THIS PHENOMENON
ACTUALLY ARE AND TO SEE IF HE CAN SOLVE IT.
I FEEL LIKE IT'S THE FIRST STORY
THAT EVER TREATED DEMONIC POSSESSION LIKE A SOLVABLE
PROBLEM, WHICH IS SOMETHING I'M
EXCITED ABOUT. &gt;&gt; WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL WITH
HALLOWEEN?
&gt;&gt; YEAH, HALLOWEEN, OCTOBER 31st, "OUTCAST" IS GOING TO BE
AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD ON
iTUNES. SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE CINEMAX,
YOU CAN GET IT ON iTUNES AND
BINGE WATCH THAT THING. &gt;&gt; DO YOU HAVE TO CHANNEL
ANYTHING?
&gt;&gt; NO, NO. HOPEFULLY NOT.
THAT'S ABOVE AND BEYOND THE CALL
OF DUTY. I'M JUST SITTING AT A KEYBOARD
WRITING A BOOK.
I DON'T NEED TO BE ENGAGING ME LIFE.
&gt;&gt; IS THERE ANY WORD ABOUT A
SEASON TWO? &gt;&gt; WE'RE FILMING SEASON TWO AS
WE SPEAK.
I'M ON SET IN SOUTH CAROLINA. WE'LL BE BACK IN 2017 WITH A
BUNCH OF NEW EPISODES.
&gt;&gt; WE GOT TO TALK ABOUT IT. THE ENTIRE WORLD HAS LOST THEIR
MIND WITH THE SEASON SEVEN
PREMIERE OF "WALKING DEAD." HOW DOES IT FEEL TO HAVE THAT
KIND OF EMOTIONAL CONNECTION
FROM YOUR AUDIENCE? &gt;&gt; PRETTY GOOD.
PRETTY GOOD.
IT'S REALLY GRATIFYING. I KNOW THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE
UPSET ABOUT THE EVENTS.
THAT'S BY DESIGN. WE EXPECTED PEOPLE TO BE UPSET.
THESE ARE BELOVED CHARACTERS
WE'RE LETTING GO OF. TO KNOW THE REACTION HAS BEEN
THAT HUGE AND TO SEE EVERYBODY
STILL LOVES THE SHOW IS REALLY GRATIFYING.
&gt;&gt; ROBERT, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
TAKING THE TIME TO TALK TO US.</description>

COME ON.
&gt;&gt; OH, GOODNESS ME. &gt;&gt; HE LANDS RIGHT ON TOP OF HER.
HE DID GET HER UP EVENTUALLY.

âªâª
&gt;&gt; BOATER. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO CALL BULL.
&gt;&gt; HE'S GOT MAD SKILLS.
THIS IS ALMOST OBNOXIOUS HOW GOOD THIS GUY IS.
&gt;&gt; HE'S NOT DRESSED LIKE A
COWBOY. IT'S LIKE HE'S JUST COME FROM
WORK.

AGAIN.
&gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE DATE NIGHT. &gt;&gt; DO WE HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON
THIS GUY?
DOES HE WORK AT THIS BAR AND HE'S JUST TRAINED UP FOR IT?
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT HIM?

INVESTIGATE EXACTLY WHAT WENT
WRONG LAST NIGHT TO CAUSE THAT PANIC FILLED KEEN.
AND TAKE A LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE
IT WAS ALL CAPTURED ON CELL PHONE VIDEO.
SMOKE FILLING THE TRAIN AND
STATION AS THAT ORANGE LINE TRAIN WAS STARTING TO LEAVE
BACK BAY STATION.
PASSENGERS SAID THE DOORS WOULDN'T OPEN, SO ONE RIDER
SMASHED A WINDOW.
FIVE PEOPLE WERE TREATED FOR MINOR INJURIES.
T OFFICIALS SAY THE PROBLEM WAS
CAUSED BY A MOTOR OVERHEATING AND THE DOORS WOULDN'T OPEN
BECAUSE THE TRAIN WAS MOVING
AND THEY DIDN'T WANT PASSENGERS TO FALL ON THE THIRD RAIL.
PASSENGERS DESCRIBE THE
SCENE.KIND OF HARD TO BREATHE AND SEE.
PRETTY THICK SMOKE.
AND CONCERNING. PEOPLE WERE COUGHING AND
PANICKING.

WITH A GOAL OF $950 MILLION AND
$1.3  BILLION DURING THE NEXT FIVE YEARS.
ONE OF THOSE PROJECTS IS
REPLACING 150 ORANGE LINE TRAINS IN 2018.

THIS YEAR HAVE BEEN ON IMPROVEMENTS TO THE RED AND
ORANGE LINE AND CITY COUNCIL
PRESIDENT MICHELLE WU TOLD ME EARLIER THIS MORNING SHE ENDED
UP TAKING THE ORANGE LINE HOME
AND AFTER THAT INCIDENT THERE WASN'T ANY PROBLEMS BECAUSE OF
IT EXCEPT FOR A COUPLE OF MINOR
DELAYS. I PLAN TO TALK TO HER LATER ON

      <description>WEB SITE, FOX25BOSTON.COM.
&gt;&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, 6:49 THIS
MORNING. WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT IT
-- A LITTLE BIT EVERYTHING
TODAY. WE ARE GOOD FOR NOW AS FAR AS
THE RAIN IS CONCERNED.
&gt;&gt; Sara:  YES. I CAN'T BELIEVE WE ARE LIVING
IN THIS MOMENT NOW WHERE HE 30
DEGREES AND THE "S" WORD. &gt;&gt; Shiri:  THE COLD WEATHER IS
HERE.
AND REALLY CHILLY WITH 20s AND 30s.
CHECK THAT FOX25 WEATHER APP.
YOU WILL BE IMPRESSED THAT NUMBER BECAUSE PROBABLY THE
LOWEST WE HAVE SEEN THIS FALL.
EARLY FLURRIES POSSIBLE HERE AND MOST ACCUMULATIONS STAY IN
THE MOUNTAINS.
ANYTHING WE GET AS FAR AS FLURRIES THIS MORNING ARE GOING
TO BE KIND OF STRAY OUT THERE.
I WANT TO YOU CLEAR STORM DRAINS TO AVOID FLOODING
BECAUSE A LOT OF LEAVES ON THE
GROUND AND HEAVY RAIN MOVING IN TONIGHT.
DAMAGING GUSTS ALSO SOMETHING
THAT WE WILL BE MONITORING TONIGHT AND FOR THE DAY
TOMORROW.
COLD ENOUGH FOR SNOW RIGHT NOW IN NEW YORK STATE, BUT BARELY
GETTING INTO WESTERNMOST NEW
ENGLAND RIGHT NOW. LOCALLY WE HAVE SOME GREEN ON
THE MAPS, DOWN AROUND THE CAPE
AND THE SOUTH SHORE. NOTHING MOVING ON SHORE YET.
WE ARE GOING TO KEEP A CLOSE
EYE ON THAT WHERE THE SPOT SPRINKLE OR SPOT TEMPERATURE IN
COMES INTO PLAY.
THE TEMPERATURES HERE AT 8 A.M. IN THE 20s AND 30s.

PROBABLY MIDDLE 40s OUT TOWARD
THE BOSTON AREA, MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES.
YOU CAN SEE EARLY AFTERNOON AND
MOSTLY RAIN ARRIVING OUT INTO THE WORCESTER HILLS, WESTERN
MASS, SOUTHWESTERN NEW
HAMPSHIRE. A LITTLE BIT OF A MIX.
IF IT COMES DOWN HARD ENOUGH IN
WORCESTER AND PARTS OF SOUTHERN NEW HAMPSHIRE, THERE COULD BE A
LITTLE BIT OF A MIX AT FIRST.
TEMPERATURE-WISE, SHOULD BE WARM ENOUGH AND GENERALLY RAIN
THAT WE ARE TRACKING THROUGH
THE EVENING COMMUTE. OVERNIGHT TONIGHT, POCKETS OF
HEAVY RAIN AT TIMES.
STAYS VERY MILD OVERNIGHT AND IN FACT YOUR HIGH TEMPERATURE
FOR TODAY, WE COULD ACHIEVE
THOSE VERY LATE IN THE DAY WITH A SLOW WARM-UP.
5:00 TOMORROW MORNING, MOST OF
US. WIDESPREAD ONE INCH OF RAINFALL
IS LIKELY FOR ME AND THAT'S
WHERE THAT ELEMENT OF CLEARING OUT THE DRAINS SO YOU DON'T GET
ANY FLOODING COMES INTO PLAY
THIS AFTERNOON. WE HAVE HIGH TEMPERATURES THAT
WILL MAKE IT INTO THE UPPER
40s. WE HAVE GOT WIND TONIGHT.
GUSTS UP TO 55 MILES PER HOUR.
WHOLE OF EASTERN MASSACHUSETTS AT RISK FOR SOME WIND DAMAGE
OUT THERE, ESPECIALLY THE CAPE.
AND WE ARE ANTICIPATING SOME HEAVY RAIN AND SOME OF THE
STRONGEST WIND.
SHOWERS TOMORROW, STAYS BREEZY, 54 AND PARTLY CLOUDY OVER THE
WEEKEND.

&gt;&gt;&gt; SHE WAS GONE FOR MORE THAN
70 HOURS, BUT THIS MORNING, THIS DRACUT WOMAN IS SAFE AND
RECOVERING FROM SPENDING ALL OF
THAT TIME OUTSIDE. DOCTORS SAY IT WAS WHERE SHE
WAS FOUND THAT MOST LIKELY
SAVED HER LIFE. FOX25'S DANIEL MILLER JOINS US
AND DANIEL, WHEN YOU TALKED TO
POLICE YESTERDAY, THEY TOLD YOU SOMETHING LIKE THIS MIGHT
HAPPEN.
&gt;&gt; Daniel:  YEAH, WHEN I TALKED TO DRACUT POLICE THEY TOLD ME
THEY WERE URGING PEOPLE TO
CHECK SHEDS AND PLACES ON THEIR PROPERTY TO SEE IF CATHERINE
LUCIER WAS INSIDE.
IT TURNS OUT SHE WAS INSIDE THIS SHED UNDER A TARP.
SHE IS BEING TREATED AT A
LOWELL HOSPITAL. FOR FOUR FULL DAYS SHE WAS
NOWHERE TO BE FOUND, AND HER
FAMILY FEARED THE WORST, BUT LATE YESTERDAY, AN OFF-DUTY
FIRE FIGHTER FOUND HER.
SHE WAS FOUND TUCKED AWAY UNDER THE TARP OF A NEIGHBOR'S BOAT
YOU SEE HERE.
SHE WAS CARRYING AROUND A BOWL AND A SPOON WHEN SHE WENT
MISSING.
AN OFF-DUTY FIRE FIGHTER WAS THE ONE THAT SPOTTED THAT BOWL.
&gt;&gt; I SAW THE BOWL ON THE SCENE.
THERE IS NO WAY THAT THIS -- THAT IS THE BOWL.
IT JUST HAPPENED TO BE RIGHT ON
AROUND THE STREET AT MY HOUSE AND HOPPED A COUPLE OF FENCES
AND WE FOUND HER.
&gt;&gt; TO JUSTIN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
TO EVERYBODY, THANK YOU VERY
MUCH. &gt;&gt; Daniel:  LUCIER SUFFERS FROM
PAKISTAN AND ALZHEIMER'S.
FAMILY MEMBERS ARE BY HER BEDSIDE AND SHE IS TRYING TO
TALK AND ANSWER QUESTIONS AND
IF YOU MENTION THE WORD "ICE CREAM" SHE WOULD LIFT HER BROW
AS IF SHE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT. AT 99 POUNDS, SHE IS CURRENTLY
NOT EATING BUT GETTING IV
FLUIDS IN THE HOSPITAL</description>

TRYING TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM GETTING HURT.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THEY DO SAY EVEN
TODAY THAT PASSENGER IS THEIR TOP PRIORITY.
NOW THE ORANGE LINE COMMUTE AND
THE T COMMUTE IN GENERAL IS IN FULL SWING FOR THE MORNING AND
MBTA IS STILL INVESTIGATING
WHAT CAUSED THAT SMOKE YESTERDAY CAUSING THAT
PANIC-FILLED SCENE.
IT WAS AN OR DEAL CAPTURED IN THIS CELL PHONE VIDEO.
SMOKE FILLING AN ORANGE LINE
TRAIN AS IT WAS LEAVING THE BACK BAY STATION DURING EVENING
RUSH.
&gt;&gt; HARD TO SEE AND BREATHE. PRETTY THICK SMOKE.
IT WAS PRETTY CONCERNING.
PEOPLE WERE COUGHING AND PANICKING.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: PANICKING BECAUSE
PASSENGERS SAY AS THAT SMOKE POURED IN, THE DOORS WOULDN'T
OPEN.
&gt;&gt; SOMEBODY SMASHED A WINDOW. THEY KICKED IT OUT AND WE ALL
JUMPED OUT OF THE T THROUGH THE
WINDOW. &gt;&gt; Reporter: SKYFOX WAS
OVERHEAD AS THEY TRIED TO
EVACUATION WAIT PASSENGERS AS THEY MOVED OUT COUNTRY SMOKEY
STATION.
&gt;&gt; WE WERE GROUPED UP IN ONE SPACE.
RUNNING UP THE ESCALATORS.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: AS TO WHAT CAUSED THE PROBLEM, T OFFICIALS SAY A
MOTOR OVERHEADING.
THEY DIDN'T WANT PASSENGERS TO FALL ON THE THIRD RAIL AND JUST
THE LATEST PROBLEM FOR THE
TRANSIT SYSTEM BURDENED WITH INFRASTRUCTURE.
MORE THAN $100 MILLION HAVE
BEEN SPENT ON MODERNIZING THE T AND MAKING IT MORE RELIABLE
WITH SOME OF THAT GOING TOWARD
IMPROVING INFRASTRUCTURE AND CARS ON THE RED AND ORANGE
LINE.
FOR PASSENGERS, MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE.
&gt;&gt; THE T WITH SPECIAL
ATTENTION. A LOT OF US USE IT EVERY DAY.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: ONE PASSENGER SAID
THEY EXPERIENCED SMOKE ON THE MBTA THREE OTHER TIMES AND
CERTAINLY CONCERNING FOR SOME
OF THE PASSENGERS THERE INVOLVED IN ALL OF THIS.
I HAVE REACHED OUT TO THE MBTA
THIS MORNING TO FIND OUT THE LATEST ON THE INVESTIGATION AND
WE WILL LET YOU KNOW WHAT WE
FIND OUT. LIVE IN THE BACK BAY STATION,

WHEN A PANEL FELL OFF AN ORANGE LINE TRAIN AND LANDED ON THE

THIS WAS IN JANUARY OF 2015 AND
OPERATOR OVERSHOT THE QUINCY STATION.

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; AN UBER DRIVER ENDS UP WITH
HIS SUV INSIDE THE WALL OF A
BUILDING IN BEACON HILL. THAT DRIVER TOLD POLICE THAT
THAT WAS ANOTHER CAR THAT SENT
HIM THROUGH THE WALL. JESSICA REYES IS LIVE IN BEACON
HILL AND YOU CAN SEE THIS
MORNING WHERE THE CAR WENT IN AND ALL OF THE DAMAGE IT LEFT
BEHIND.
&gt;&gt; YOU SURE CAN,  GENE, THIS ALL HAPPENED RIGHT IN THE HEART
OF BEACON HILL RIGHT IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD. REALLY TIGHTLY PACKED HERE AND
LOOKING BEHIND ME, YOU CAN SEE
THE GARAGE THAT IS NOW BOARDED UP AFTER THAT SUV PLOWED INTO
IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
AFTERNOON YESTERDAY. QUITE A SCENE HERE.
TAKING A LOOK AT SOME VIDEO
FROM SKYFOX RIGHT AFTER IT ALL HAPPENED.
YOU CAN SEE THAT SUV STILL
STUCK IN THE WALL HERE AND POLICE SAY IT WAS A UBER DRIVER
AT THE WHEEL AND HE DID HAVE A
PASSENGER IN THE CAR WITH HIM. THAT DRIVER TOLD POLICE HE WAS
TRYING TO TURN LEFT WHEN
ANOTHER CAR CLIPPED HIS AND SENDING IT FLYING INTO THIS
HOME HERE.
IT WAS A TRICKY PROCESS WE UNDERSTAND TO GET THE CAR OUT.
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT DID HAVE A
INSPECTOR ON SCENE THAT GAVE THE OKAY BEFORE TOWING THE CAR
OUT OF THERE.
FOR THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE, IT WILL BE A VERY LONG CLEANUP
PROCESS.
LIKELY A VERY LONG HEADACHE FOR THEM AND NO ONE WAS SERIOUSLY
HURT.
THE TWO PEOPLE IN THAT UBER CAR WAS TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL BUT
ONLY TO BE CHECKED OUT AFTER
THE CRASH. LIVE IN BEACON HILL THIS

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; --
A MAD DASH TO THE CAR PUB
PARKED ON DRIVEWAY OR THE STREETS.
SO BITTER COLD OUT THERE.
&gt;&gt; Shiri:  EVEN COLDER THAN YESTERDAY.
ANOTHER ROUND OF FROST
ADVISORIES AND WARNINGS FOR EASTERN MASSACHUSETTS.
WE ARE STARTING THINGS OFF FOR
EVERYBODY INTO CENTRAL MASS, SOUTHERN NEW HAMPSHIRE IN THE
20s AND 30s.
COLD AND COLD ENOUGH FOR SNOW IN NEW YORK STATE RIGHT NOW.
LOCALLY, WE DON'T HAVE ANY
PRECIPITATIONS YESTERDAY. I AM WATCHING A COUPLE OF
SPRINKLES OFF THE COAST OF THE
SOUTH SHORE AND THE CAPE. A LOT OF IT DRYING UP AS IT
COMES DOWN, SO I DON'T THINK WE
WILL FEEL ANY BIG IMPACTS FROM THAT, BUT I WANT TO POINT OUT
AT 10 A.M., IF WE GET A LITTLE
SPRINKLE AT THE COASTLINE, A POTENTIAL FOR A LITTLE
TEMPERATURE IN OUT THERE.
DON'T BE SURPRISED A COUPLE OF FLURRIES THIS MORNING.
OUR MAIN RAIN INTO CENTRAL
MASSACHUSETTS BETWEEN 1 AND 3 P.M. STILL GOING WITH MOSTLY
RAIN HERE, BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT
WE HAVE A LITTLE MIXING OUT INTO KEENE, NEW HAMPSHIRE.
AND IF IT COMES DOWN HEAVY
ENOUGH AND TEMPERATURES ARE STILL COOL YOU ENOUGH, WE COULD
SEE THAT LITTLE BIT OF A MIX
WITH SNOW OR SLEET AND THE RAIN IN THE WORCESTER AREA.
IT IS NOT GOING TO SIT GUYS.
MOST OF THIS IS PLAIN RAIN. ARRIVES IN BOSTON BETWEEN 2 AND
5 P.M., BUT TURNS HEAVIER
BETWEEN 5 AND 8 P.M. OVERNIGHT SOAKING RAINS.
IT COMES DOWN HEAVY.
WE HAVE GOT WIND AND RAIN. NO MORE KNOW THOUGH EVEN INTO
THE MOUNTAINS.
WE ARE MAKING THAT FLIP OVER TO ALL SHOWERS BECAUSE
TEMPERATURES STAY VERY MILD
OVERNIGHT AND SHOWERS COME TO AN END FOR MANY BY 5 A.M.
INCLUDING THE BOSTON AREA AND I
THINK WE HAVE A CUP OF LINGERING SHOWERS INTO SOUTHERN
NEW HAMPSHIRE AND OUTER CAPE
UNTIL 8:00 TOMORROW MORNING AND TOMORROW AFTERNOON.
LOOKING A LOT BETTER BECAUSE
BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS BUT WIND WILL BE A BIG PLAYER IN YOUR
FRIDAY FORECAST SO TODAY, HEAVY
RAIN IS THE BIGGEST CONCERN BECAUSE WE COULD SEE LOCALIZED
FLOODING.
STORM DRAINS CLOGGED BY LEAVES. THE THREAT FOR ANY KIND OF âª
TWEET MORNING TEMPERATURE INS
IN MASSACHUSETTS AND ACCUMULATION IN THE MOUNTAINS
WILL BE MINIMAL.
ALL THE ACCUMULATION INTO THE PWESH SHIRES INTO THE MOUNTAINS
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE AND VERMONT.
I BELIEVE WE HILL THE HIGH TEMPERATURES PRETTY LATE IN THE
DAY AS WELL, SO JUST KEEP IN
MIND, IT IS GOING TO BE ANOTHER COOL DAY.
INCREASING CLOUDS VERY QUICKLY
TODAY AND THAT RAIN DEVELOPS AND STAYS HEAVY  NIGHT TONIGHT
BREEZY TOMORROW AT 54 DEGREES.
PARTLY CLOUDY, SATURDAY. SUNDAY, THE CHANCE FOR CUP OF
SPOT SHOWERS OUT THERE AND DRY
AGAIN BY HALLOWEEN ON MONDAY WITH HIGHS AROUND 54.
GENE, BACK TO YOU.
&gt;&gt; Gene:  6:19 THIS MORNING. A LOCAL CITY CRACKING DOWN ON A
POPULAR REP TALL WEB SITE.

      <description>CITY AND TEAM.
&gt;&gt;&gt; WARNING TWITTER USERS OF A
HACK THAT IS TAKING OVER THEIR CELL PHONES.
ALL STARTS WITH A TWEET THAT
CONTAINS A LINK SOMETIMES ASKING OTHERS TO SUPPORT A
CAUSE, FOR EXAMPLE.
BUT CLICKING ON THE LINK CAUSES SMARTPHONES TO AUTOMATICALLY
CALL 911.
THE VICTIMS SAY EVERY TIME THEY HANG UP, THE PHONE JUST STARTS
CALLING 911 OVER AND OVER
AGAIN. ONE WOMAN SAID THE HACK CAUSED
HER PHONE TO CALL POLICE OVER
150 TIMES. &gt;&gt; I FEEL HORRIBLE.
LIKE BLOWING UP THEIR PHONE AND
I DON'T WANT THEM TO COME TO MY HOUSE WHEN THERE IS NOT AN
EMERGENCY.
THEY COULD BE SAVING SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE.
&gt;&gt; POLICE SAY THE ONLY WAY TO
STOP THE HACK IS TO SHUT DOWN THE PHONE ALL THE WAY AND WAIT
A FEW MINUTES BEFORE YOU POWER
IT BACK ON AGAIN.</description>

SHE LOVES ME AWAY
&gt;&gt; THE AD ONLY TOOK ABOUT SIX HOURS TO FILM AND ALL OF THEIR

A CUP OF DEGREES IN THE MIDDLE 30s.
39 IN WORCESTER AT 10 A.M.
ALTHOUGH WE GET INTO THE LOWER 40s TODAY.
AS THAT RAIN ARRIVES, WE COULD
DROP TEMPERATURES ENOUGH SO THAT WE CAN EVEN SEE A LITTLE
SNOW AND A LITTLE SLEET MIXING
IN BEFORE WE SLIP OVER TO JUST PLAIN HEAVY RAIN.
I HAVE FUTURE CAST READY TO
TIME IT OUT FOR YOU IN TEN MINUTES.

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; RIDER ON THE ORANGE LINE
ARE HOPING FOR A CALMER COMMUTE
ONE DAY AFTER THEY BROKE WINDOWS AND WENT OUT OF A CAR
FILLED WITH SMOKE.
&gt;&gt; ASKING WHY DRIVERS LEFT THE DOOR SHUT.
CATHERINE, THE T SAYS THEY WERE
TRYING TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM GETTING HURT.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THEY DO SAY EVEN
TODAY THAT PASSENGER IS THEIR TOP PRIORITY.
NOW THE ORANGE LINE COMMUTE AND
THE T COMMUTE IN GENERAL IS IN FULL SWING FOR THE MORNING AND
MBTA IS STILL INVESTIGATING
WHAT CAUSED THAT SMOKE YESTERDAY CAUSING THAT
PANIC-FILLED SCENE.
IT WAS AN OR DEAL CAPTURED IN THIS CELL PHONE VIDEO.
SMOKE FILLING AN ORANGE LINE
TRAIN AS IT WAS LEAVING THE BACK BAY STATION DURING EVENING
RUSH.
&gt;&gt; HARD TO SEE AND BREATHE. PRETTY THICK SMOKE.
IT WAS PRETTY CONCERNING.
PEOPLE WERE COUGHING AND PANICKING.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: PANICKING BECAUSE
PASSENGERS SAY AS THAT SMOKE POURED IN, THE DOORS WOULDN'T
OPEN.
&gt;&gt; SOMEBODY SMASHED A WINDOW. THEY KICKED IT OUT AND WE ALL
JUMPED OUT OF THE T THROUGH THE
WINDOW. &gt;&gt; Reporter: SKYFOX WAS
OVERHEAD AS THEY TRIED TO
EVACUATION WAIT PASSENGERS AS THEY MOVED OUT COUNTRY SMOKEY
STATION.
&gt;&gt; WE WERE GROUPED UP IN ONE SPACE.
RUNNING UP THE ESCALATORS.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: AS TO WHAT CAUSED THE PROBLEM, T OFFICIALS SAY A
MOTOR OVERHEADING.
THEY DIDN'T WANT PASSENGERS TO FALL ON THE THIRD RAIL AND JUST
THE LATEST PROBLEM FOR THE
TRANSIT SYSTEM BURDENED WITH INFRASTRUCTURE.
MORE THAN $100 MILLION HAVE
BEEN SPENT ON MODERNIZING THE T AND MAKING IT MORE RELIABLE
WITH SOME OF THAT GOING TOWARD
IMPROVING INFRASTRUCTURE AND CARS ON THE RED AND ORANGE
LINE.
FOR PASSENGERS, MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE.
&gt;&gt; THE T WITH SPECIAL
ATTENTION. A LOT OF US USE IT EVERY DAY.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: ONE PASSENGER SAID
THEY EXPERIENCED SMOKE ON THE MBTA THREE OTHER TIMES AND
CERTAINLY CONCERNING FOR SOME
OF THE PASSENGERS THERE INVOLVED IN ALL OF THIS.
I HAVE REACHED OUT TO THE MBTA
THIS MORNING TO FIND OUT THE LATEST ON THE INVESTIGATION AND
WE WILL LET YOU KNOW WHAT WE
FIND OUT. LIVE IN THE BACK BAY STATION,

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; AN UBER DRIVER ENDS UP WITH
HIS SUV INSIDE THE WALL OF A
BUILDING IN BEACON HILL. THAT DRIVER TOLD POLICE THAT
THAT WAS ANOTHER CAR THAT SENT
HIM THROUGH THE WALL. JESSICA REYES IS LIVE IN BEACON
HILL AND YOU CAN SEE THIS
MORNING WHERE THE CAR WENT IN AND ALL OF THE DAMAGE IT LEFT
BEHIND.
&gt;&gt; YOU SURE CAN,  GENE, THIS ALL HAPPENED RIGHT IN THE HEART
OF BEACON HILL RIGHT IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD. REALLY TIGHTLY PACKED HERE AND
LOOKING BEHIND ME, YOU CAN SEE
THE GARAGE THAT IS NOW BOARDED UP AFTER THAT SUV PLOWED INTO
IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
AFTERNOON YESTERDAY. QUITE A SCENE HERE.
TAKING A LOOK AT SOME VIDEO
FROM SKYFOX RIGHT AFTER IT ALL HAPPENED.
YOU CAN SEE THAT SUV STILL
STUCK IN THE WALL HERE AND POLICE SAY IT WAS A UBER DRIVER
AT THE WHEEL AND HE DID HAVE A
PASSENGER IN THE CAR WITH HIM. THAT DRIVER TOLD POLICE HE WAS
TRYING TO TURN LEFT WHEN
ANOTHER CAR CLIPPED HIS AND SENDING IT FLYING INTO THIS
HOME HERE.
IT WAS A TRICKY PROCESS WE UNDERSTAND TO GET THE CAR OUT.
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT DID HAVE A
INSPECTOR ON SCENE THAT GAVE THE OKAY BEFORE TOWING THE CAR
OUT OF THERE.
FOR THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE, IT WILL BE A VERY LONG CLEANUP
PROCESS.
LIKELY A VERY LONG HEADACHE FOR THEM AND NO ONE WAS SERIOUSLY
HURT.
THE TWO PEOPLE IN THAT UBER CAR WAS TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL BUT
ONLY TO BE CHECKED OUT AFTER
THE CRASH. LIVE IN BEACON HILL THIS

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; --
A MAD DASH TO THE CAR PUB
PARKED ON DRIVEWAY OR THE STREETS.
SO BITTER COLD OUT THERE.
&gt;&gt; Shiri:  EVEN COLDER THAN YESTERDAY.
ANOTHER ROUND OF FROST
ADVISORIES AND WARNINGS FOR EASTERN MASSACHUSETTS.
WE ARE STARTING THINGS OFF FOR
EVERYBODY INTO CENTRAL MASS, SOUTHERN NEW HAMPSHIRE IN THE
20s AND 30s.
COLD AND COLD ENOUGH FOR SNOW IN NEW YORK STATE RIGHT NOW.
LOCALLY, WE DON'T HAVE ANY
PRECIPITATIONS YESTERDAY. I AM WATCHING A COUPLE OF
SPRINKLES OFF THE COAST OF THE
SOUTH SHORE AND THE CAPE. A LOT OF IT DRYING UP AS IT
COMES DOWN, SO I DON'T THINK WE
WILL FEEL ANY BIG IMPACTS FROM THAT, BUT I WANT TO POINT OUT
AT 10 A.M., IF WE GET A LITTLE
SPRINKLE AT THE COASTLINE, A POTENTIAL FOR A LITTLE
TEMPERATURE IN OUT THERE.
DON'T BE SURPRISED A COUPLE OF FLURRIES THIS MORNING.
OUR MAIN RAIN INTO CENTRAL
MASSACHUSETTS BETWEEN 1 AND 3 P.M. STILL GOING WITH MOSTLY
RAIN HERE, BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT
WE HAVE A LITTLE MIXING OUT INTO KEENE, NEW HAMPSHIRE.
AND IF IT COMES DOWN HEAVY
ENOUGH AND TEMPERATURES ARE STILL COOL YOU ENOUGH, WE COULD
SEE THAT LITTLE BIT OF A MIX
WITH SNOW OR SLEET AND THE RAIN IN THE WORCESTER AREA.
IT IS NOT GOING TO SIT GUYS.
MOST OF THIS IS PLAIN RAIN. ARRIVES IN BOSTON BETWEEN 2 AND
5 P.M., BUT TURNS HEAVIER
BETWEEN 5 AND 8 P.M. OVERNIGHT SOAKING RAINS.
IT COMES DOWN HEAVY.
WE HAVE GOT WIND AND RAIN. NO MORE KNOW THOUGH EVEN INTO
THE MOUNTAINS.
WE ARE MAKING THAT FLIP OVER TO ALL SHOWERS BECAUSE
TEMPERATURES STAY VERY MILD
OVERNIGHT AND SHOWERS COME TO AN END FOR MANY BY 5 A.M.
INCLUDING THE BOSTON AREA AND I
THINK WE HAVE A CUP OF LINGERING SHOWERS INTO SOUTHERN
NEW HAMPSHIRE AND OUTER CAPE
UNTIL 8:00 TOMORROW MORNING AND TOMORROW AFTERNOON.
LOOKING A LOT BETTER BECAUSE
BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS BUT WIND WILL BE A BIG PLAYER IN YOUR
FRIDAY FORECAST SO TODAY, HEAVY
RAIN IS THE BIGGEST CONCERN BECAUSE WE COULD SEE LOCALIZED
FLOODING.
STORM DRAINS CLOGGED BY LEAVES. THE THREAT FOR ANY KIND OF âª
TWEET MORNING TEMPERATURE INS
IN MASSACHUSETTS AND ACCUMULATION IN THE MOUNTAINS
WILL BE MINIMAL.
ALL THE ACCUMULATION INTO THE PWESH SHIRES INTO THE MOUNTAINS
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE AND VERMONT.
I BELIEVE WE HILL THE HIGH TEMPERATURES PRETTY LATE IN THE
DAY AS WELL, SO JUST KEEP IN
MIND, IT IS GOING TO BE ANOTHER COOL DAY.
INCREASING CLOUDS VERY QUICKLY
TODAY AND THAT RAIN DEVELOPS AND STAYS HEAVY  NIGHT TONIGHT
BREEZY TOMORROW AT 54 DEGREES.
PARTLY CLOUDY, SATURDAY. SUNDAY, THE CHANCE FOR CUP OF
SPOT SHOWERS OUT THERE AND DRY
AGAIN BY HALLOWEEN ON MONDAY WITH HIGHS AROUND 54.
GENE, BACK TO YOU.
&gt;&gt; Gene:  6:19 THIS MORNING. A LOCAL CITY CRACKING DOWN ON A
POPULAR REP TALL WEB SITE.

      <description>CITY AND TEAM.
&gt;&gt;&gt; WARNING TWITTER USERS OF A
HACK THAT IS TAKING OVER THEIR CELL PHONES.
ALL STARTS WITH A TWEET THAT
CONTAINS A LINK SOMETIMES ASKING OTHERS TO SUPPORT A
CAUSE, FOR EXAMPLE.
BUT CLICKING ON THE LINK CAUSES SMARTPHONES TO AUTOMATICALLY
CALL 911.
THE VICTIMS SAY EVERY TIME THEY HANG UP, THE PHONE JUST STARTS
CALLING 911 OVER AND OVER
AGAIN. ONE WOMAN SAID THE HACK CAUSED
HER PHONE TO CALL POLICE OVER
150 TIMES. &gt;&gt; I FEEL HORRIBLE.
LIKE BLOWING UP THEIR PHONE AND
I DON'T WANT THEM TO COME TO MY HOUSE WHEN THERE IS NOT AN
EMERGENCY.
THEY COULD BE SAVING SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE.
&gt;&gt; POLICE SAY THE ONLY WAY TO
STOP THE HACK IS TO SHUT DOWN THE PHONE ALL THE WAY AND WAIT
A FEW MINUTES BEFORE YOU POWER
IT BACK ON AGAIN.</description>

BEGGING PEOPLE TO RE-ELECT HER
HUSBAND. HE SAYS THE MONEY CRUNCHING

&gt;&gt; THE TAX RATE WAS -- &gt;&gt; WAS HE ALWAYS LIKE?
&gt;&gt; YEAH,  ALL THE TIME.
PLEASE RE-ELECT GERALD -- PLEASE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
&gt;&gt; Gene:  GERALD DOHERTY IS RUNNING FOR TEXAS COMMISSIONER
AND HE THINKS THE AD WENT VIRAL
BECAUSE HUMOR TAKES THE EDGE OFF THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.
HIS WIFE OF 21  YEARS WAS A
NATURAL IN HER ROLE AS THE EYE-ROLLING SPOUSE.
HE SAID THAT SHOT ONLY TOOK TWO
OR THREE TAKES. &gt;&gt; SHE DOES LOVE ME A LOT, BUT
SHE LOVES ME AWAY
&gt;&gt; THE AD ONLY TOOK ABOUT SIX HOURS TO FILM AND ALL OF THEIR
FRIENDS PLAYED THEIR NEIGHBORS.
GERALD SAID THE ONLY COMPLAINT IS THAT THE STEAK LOOKED
OVERCOOKED DURING THE DINNER
SCENE. &gt;&gt; I THINK MY MOM CAN RELATE TO
THAT EYE ROLLING.
&gt;&gt; Gene:  MY WIFE WITH DO THAT EYE ROLL IN ONE TAKE.
YOU PROBABLY HAVE THAT DOWN

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; RIDERS ON THE A WRONG LINE
ARE HOPING FOR A CALMER
COMMUTE. ONE DAY AFTER PASSENGERS BROKE
WINDOWS AND JUMPED OUT OF A CAR
FILLED WITH SMOKE. &gt;&gt; NOW THE SCARE HAD MANY
ASKING WHY THE DRIVER KEPT THE
DOORS SHUT. FOX25'S CATHERINE PARROTTA LIVE
AT THE BACK BAY STATION THIS
MORNING AND CATHERINE, THE T SAYS THEY ARE TRYING TO GET
PEOPLE FROM GETTING HURT.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THEY SAY THAT PASSENGER SAFETY IS THEIR TOP
PRIORITY, AND, OF COURSE, THE
MORNING COMMUTE IS ABOUT TO BEGIN ON THE ORANGE LINE AND
THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUES
INTO WHAT WENT WRONG CAUSING THAT PANIC-FILLED SCENE
YESTERDAY.
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS CELL PHONE VIDEO AND IT IS ALL CAPTURED
RIGHT THERE.
INSIDE ONE OF THE ORANGE LINE TRAINS AS IT WAS STARTING TO
LEAVE BACK BAY STATION JUST
BEFORE 5:00. A BUSY TIME ON THAT TRAIN.
PASSENGERS SAID THE DOORS
WOULDN'T OPEN, SO ONE RIDER SMASHED A WINDOW AND PASSENGERS
GOT OUT THAT WAY AS SMOKE
STARTED TO FILL THAT TRAIN. ONE PASSENGER DESCRIBED THAT
SCENE.
&gt;&gt; IT WAS KIND OF HARD TO BELIEVE AND SEE.
IT WAS PRETTY THICK SMOKE, SO
PRETTY CONCERNING. PEOPLE WERE COUGHING, AND
PANICKING.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: FIVE PEOPLE WERE TREATED FOR MINOR INJURIES.
T OFFICIALS SAY THE PROBLEM WAS
LIKELY CAUSED BY A MOTOR OVERHEATING AND THEY SAID THE
DOORS WOULDN'T OPEN NOT BECAUSE
OF A MALFUNCTION BUT THAT TRAIN WAS MOVING AND THEY DIDN'T WANT
PASSENGERS FALLING ON TO THE
THIRD RAIL. ONE PASSENGER TOLD US THE THIRD
TIME SHE PERSONALLY EXPERIENCED
SMOKE ON THE T  AND PASSENGERS ARE LOOKING FOR IMPROVEMENTS.
WE WILL BE REACHING OUT TO FIND
THE LATEST ON THE INVESTIGATION.
LIVE IN BACK BAY STATION,

      <description>SHE PASSED AWAY IN THE CRASH.
&gt;&gt;&gt; AN UBER DRIVER ENDS UP WITH
HIS SUV IN THE WALL OF A BEACON HILL BUILDING.
THE DRIVER TOLD THE POLICE THAT
ANOTHER CAR SENT HIM STRAIGHT THROUGH THAT WALL.
JESS, WE CAN SEE WHERE THAT CAR
WENT INTO THE BUILDING. &gt;&gt; Reporter: YEAH, IT IS QUITE
A MESS HERE, GENE.
THIS IS THE HEART OF BEACON HILL, AN AREA WE KNOW IS VERY
TIGHTLY PACKED.
IT HAS VERY NARROW STREETS, AND YOU CAN SEE THE WALL HERE THAT
THAT SUV WENT INTO.
IT IS ALL BOARDED UP THIS MORNING NOW, BUT QUITE A SCENE
HERE RIGHT NOW THIS HAPPENED
AROUND 3:00 YESTERDAY AFTERNOON.
IN THIS VIDEO FROM SKYFOX, YOU
CAN STILL SEE THAT SUV STUCK IN THE WALL HERE, AND POLICE SAY
AN UBER DRIVER WAS BEHIND THE
WHEEL AND DID HAVE A PASSENGER IN THE CAR WITH HIM.
THAT DRIVER TOLD POLICE HE WAS
TRYING TO TURN LEFT WHEN ANOTHER CAR CLIPPED HIS SENDING
IT FLYING INTO THIS HOME HERE.
NOW IT WAS A BIT OF A TRICKY PROCESS, WE DO UNDERSTAND, TO
GET THE SUV OUT OF HERE AT
FIRST. BUT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT DID
HAVE A BUILDING INSPECTOR ON
SCENE THAT MADE SURE THAT THE WALL WAS STABLE ENOUGH TO PULL
IT OUT.
SO, OF COURSE, IT IS GOING TO BE A LOT OF CLEANING UP FOR THE
PEOPLE INSIDE THIS HOME AND IT
WAS STRUCTURALLY SOUND AND NO ONE WAS SERIOUSLY HURT.
THE TWO PEOPLE IN THE SUV THE
DRIVER AND THE PASSENGERS WERE TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL ONLY TO
BE CHECKED OUT.

NOTIFIED ANY STATE OR CITY

PRIOR INVESTIGATIONS ONLINE FOR EVERYONE TO SEE.
THE AGENCY IS STILL

POPULAR NORTH SHORE TRAIL.
FOX25'S DANIEL MILLER JOINS US NOW AND DANIEL, THIS INCIDENT
ALSO HAPPENED SO CLOSE TO A
SCHOOL. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT, SARA.
IT HAPPENED ON THE OLD RAIL
TRAIL. A WOMAN TOLD POLICE SHE WAS --
THAT SHE WAS WALKING ON THAT
SECTION OF THE TRAIL WHEN A MAN WEARING A MASK RODE UP WHO HER
ON HIS BIKE, TRIED GRAB HER AND
THEN EXPOSED HIMSELF. THE WOMAN IMMEDIATELY BACKED
AWAY AND STARTED SHOUTING FOR
HELP. THE SUSPECT TOOK OFF.
OTHER PEOPLE ON THE TRAIL HEARD
HER CALLS FOR HELP AND IMMEDIATELY CALLED 911.
POLICE CLOSED OFF THE TRAIL FOR
ABOUT A MILE WHILE THEY USED A POLICE DOG TO SEARCH FOR ANY
SIGN OF THE SUSPECT.
&gt;&gt; WOULD YOU THINK PEOPLE WOULDN'T HAVE THAT PROBLEMS,
BUT SOMETHING THAT IS HAPPENING
EVERYWHERE TODAY AND YOU JUST GOT TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT IT.
&gt;&gt; Daniel:  POLICE SAY THE
SUSPECT WAS WEARING A BLACK OR GRAY SKI CAP AND A SKI MASK
THAT PULLED UP TO ABOUT HIS
NOSE. HE WAS ABOUT 5'7"AND HAD A THIN
BUILD AND RIDING A MOUNTAIN
BIKE. AND SARA, I AM REACHING OUT TO
TO THE POLICE TO FIND OUT IF
THEY HAVE ANY NEW INFORMATION IN THIS CASE AND I WILL BRING
IT TO IF YOU THEY DO.

THE SURVEY FOUND THAT 40% OF
ALL FEMALE JOGGERS HAVE BEEN HARASSED, SOMETIMES SEXUALLY
WHILE JOGGING.
ACCORDING TO THE SURVEY THE AGGRESSORS WERE OVERWHELMINGLY
MALE.
IN CONTRAST, ONLY 4% OF MEN SAY THEY WERE SEXUALLY HARASSED
WHILE JOGGING.
THE REPORT COMES ON THE HEEL OF VANESSA MARCOTTE'S MURDER.
POLICE FOUND HER BODY IN THE
WOODS OFF A RURAL ROAD. THE BU GRAD LIVED IN NEW YORK
CITY BUT WAS VISITING HER
MOTHER. DESPITE HUNDREDS OF TIPS,

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE.
IT IS 5:15.
LET'S HEAD ON OUT TO OUR MAPS RIGHT NOW WHERE WE ARE SEEING A
LOT OF GREEN.
THAT A GOOD SIGN. UNFORTUNATELY, IT WILL START
CHANGE IN AN HOUR AND 15
MINUTES AT 6:30. RIGHT 1, 93 SOUTH ARE CLEAR.
NO ISSUES ON THE PIKE INTO 128
AND INTO THE ALLSTON-BRIGHTON AREA.
I DO WANT TO PUT IT ON YOUR
RADAR. THE DEMOLITION IS STARTING ON
THE TOLL PLAZA AND IT WILL
REALLY -- YOU WILL START TO FEEL THE EFFECTS OF THAT ON
MONDAY DURNG THE MORNING --
DURING THE MONDAY MORNING COMMUTE.
PLAN EXTRA TIME OR AVOID THE
PIKE ALL TOGETHER WHAT MASS DOT IS TELLING PEOPLE.
EXPRESSWAY MOVING ALONG WITHOUT
ISSUE AND VERY DARK. YOU CAN SEE A HANDLE OF TAIL
LIGHTS PAST THE GAS TANK.
12 MINUTES ON ROUTE 1 FROM 128 TO THE TOBIN.
10 MINUTES ON THE EXPRESSWAY.
19 MINUTES ON 93 SOUTH FROM 495</description>

      <description>TO THE LEVERETT CONNECTOR.
GENE AND SARA, BACK TO YOU.
&gt;&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, 5:17 NOW ON THIS THURSDAY MORNING.
AND YOU THOUGHT IT WAS COLD
YESTERDAY. IT IS EVEN COLDER TODAY, RIGHT.
&gt;&gt; YES, YES IT IS.
COLDER TODAY. WE HAVE THAT FROST ADVISORY
BACK.
I HAVE GOT THE FREEZE WARNINGS BANG.
LET'S DRESS FOR THE 20s AND 30s
SHALL WE. &gt;&gt; Daniel:  DONE.
&gt;&gt; Shiri:  DONE.
THIS IS THE DEAL. THE ADVISORIES AT 9 A.M.
THE WHOLE MORNING COMMUTE WILL
BE REALLY COLD. WE HAVE ALL THIS COLD AIR IN
PLACE COLD ENOUGH FOR SNOW OUT
THIS NEW YORK, BUT AS THIS WHOLE THING SHIFTS TOWARD US.
IT IS MOSTLY COMING IN AS RAIN.
LET'S BREAK IT DOWN WITH FUTURE CAST BECAUSE THIS MORNING THE
THINGS THAT I AM GOING TO BE
WATCHING WILL BE SPRINKLES ALONG THE COASTLINE.
I HAVE CONCERNS GIVEN THE
TEMPERATURE IN PLYMOUTH RIGHT NOW IS FREEZING.
THAT MEANS A LITTLE BIT OF A
PATCHY GLARE ACROSS THE SOUTH SHORE AND ALSO THE POTENTIAL
FOR SOME FLURRIES MIXING IN SO
I DON'T WANT TO YOU BE SHOCKED IF YOU SEE THAT.
ONCE WE HIT THE AFTERNOON
THOUGH IN OUR MAIN EVENT REALLY KICKS INTO GEAR BETWEEN ABOUT 2
OR 3:00 THIS AFTERNOON AS
ESSENTIALLY THE START TIME. YOU WILL SEE THAT STEADY RAIN
SPREAD INTO AREAS LIKE CENTRAL
MASSACHUSETTS, SOUTHERN NEW HAMPSHIRE, AND IF IT COMES IN
HEAVY ENOUGH, IT CAN LOWER
TEMPERATURES ENOUGH TO FLIP THINGS OVER TO A LITTLE BIT OF
A MIX.
A LITTLE RAIN SNOW MIX OR RAIN SLEET MIX.
YOU ARE QUICKLY CHANGING OVER
TO ALL JUST PLAIN RAIN THERE. NO ACTUAL ACCUMULATION IS
EXPECTED UNLESS YOU ARE COMING
OUT INTO THE MOUNTAINS. WE HAVE THAT HEAVY RAIN PICKING
UP DURING THE EVENING COMMUTE
IN BOSTON, IT STAYS OCCASIONALLY HEAVY.
AND DURING THE EARLY PART OF
THAT FRIDAY MORNING COMMUTE. SHOWERS WILL WIND DOWN BETWEEN
5 AND 8 A.M. TOMORROW MORNING.
THE EXCEPTION, THE OUTER CAPE AND SOUTHERN NEW HAMPSHIRE
COULD TAKE INTO LATE MORNING.
YOU GUYS TRULY DRY OUT. WE STAY MOSTLY CLOUDY TOMORROW.
HOPEFULLY SEEING A COUPLE OF
BREAKS IN THE CLOUD COVER BUT WIND TURNS INTO A BIG ISSUE
TONIGHT INTO YOUR FRIDAY.
HEAVY RAIN, A WIND ADVISE RADIO HE THAT GOES INTO EFFECT
OVERNIGHT TONIGHT AND TOMORROW
FOR GUSTS UP TO 45 MILES PER HOUR.
SNOW A MINIMAL RISK BECAUSE ALL
OF THE ACCUMULATION STAYING OUT WEST.
NO MORE THAN SOME FLURRIES IN
CENTRAL OR EASTERN MASSACHUSETTS.
HERE TOUGH.
TODAY'S HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL GET STUCK IN THE 40s FOR MOST
OF US.
SLOW WARM-UP ESPECIALLY OUT INTO WORCESTER, MERRIMACK
VALLEY.
SPOTS TO WATCH OUT FOR. A BRIEF LITTLE MIX.
54 YOUR HIGH TOMORROW.
BREEZY AND SHOULD TURN BRIGHTER IN THE AFTERNOON.
MOSTLY CLOUDY WITH UPPER 50s
OVER THE WEEKEND. THE BEST CHANCE FOR SHOWERS IS
NOW ON SUNDAY.
BACK OVER TO YOU, GUYS.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; POLICE ACROSS THE COUNTRY
ARE WARNING TWITTER USERS ABOUT
A HACK TAKING OVER SMARTPHONES. VICTIMS OF THE HACK SAY IT ALL
STARTS WITH A TWEET THAT
CONTAINS A LINK SOMETIMES WITH PEOPLE ASKING OTHERS TO SUPPORT
A CAUSE, BUT CLICKING ON THAT
LINK CAUSES A SMARTPHONE TO AUTOMATICALLY CALL 911.
VICTIMS SAY EVERY TIME THEY
HANG UP, THE PHONE JUST STARTS CALLING 911 OVER AND OVER
AGAIN.
ONE WOMAN SAID THE HACK CAUSED HER PHONE TO CALL POLICE OVER 1
150 TIMES.
&gt;&gt; I FEEL HORRIBLE BECAUSE IT IS LIKE BLOWING UP THEIR PHONE
AND I DON'T WANT THEM TO COME
TO MY HOUSE WHEN THERE IS NOT AN EMERGENCY.
THEY COULD BE SAVING SOMEONE
ELSE'S LIFE. &gt;&gt; Gene:  THE ONLY WAY TO SHUT
DOWN THE HACK IS POWER DOWN
YOUR PHONE ALL THE WAY AND THEN</description>

      <description>WHEN HE IS FOUND, THE MAN COULD
FACE FELONY VANDALISM CHARGES.
&gt;&gt;&gt; THE CLINTON AND TRUMP CAMPAIGNS COULD LEARN A THING
OR TWO OF A HILARIOUS TEXAS
WIFE BEGGING VOTERS TO RE-ELECT HER HUSBAND.
SHE SAID THE NUMBER CRUNCHING
NERD NEEDS SOMETHING TO DO BECAUSE HE IS DRIVING HER
CRAZY.
&gt;&gt; GERALD REALLY DOESN'T HAVE ANY HOBBIES.
&gt;&gt; LAST YEAR'S TAX RATE WAS --
&gt;&gt; WAS HE ALWAYS LIKE THAT? &gt;&gt; YEAH,  ALL THE TIME.
PLEASE RE-ELECT GERALD.
PLEASE. [ LAUGHTER ]
&gt;&gt; Gene:  GERALD DOHERTY WHO IS
RUNNING FOR TEXAS COMMISSIONER THINKS THE AD WENT VIRAL
BECAUSE OF THE HUMOR.
IT TAKES THE EDGE OFF THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.
HE SAYS HIS WIFE OF 21 YEARS
CHARLENE WAS A NATURAL IN HER ROLE AS THE EYE-ROLLING SPOUSE.
 HE SAID THAT SHOT ONLY TOOK
ABOUT TWO OR THREE TAKES. &gt;&gt; SHE DOES LOVE ME A LOT, BUT
SHE LOVES ME AWAY.
&gt;&gt; Gene:  NOW THEY SAY THE AD ONLY TOOK SIX HOURS TO FILM AND
ALL OF THEIR FRIENDS PLAYED THE
NEIGHBORS. GERALD SAYS THE ONLY COMPLAINT
HE GETS THAT THE STEAK LOOKS TO
BE OVERCOOKED DURING THE DINNER THEME.
&gt;&gt; Sara:  THE CUTEST THING.
SO REAL. MANY WOMEN FEEL THAT WAY WHEN
THEIR HUSBANDS RETIRE.
&gt;&gt; Gene:  PLAYS SO WELL. WE COULD USE MORE OF THAT,
SHIRI.
&gt;&gt; Shiri:  WE COULD USE MORE LAUGHS DURING THIS ELECTION.

      <description>WE ARE LIVE AS COMMUTERS GET
BACK ON THE ORANGE LINE.
&gt;&gt;&gt; A NEW REPORT SHOW THE SHERIFF DEPUTY WHO SHOT AND
KILLED THE TAUNTON STABBING
SUSPECT WAS JUSTIFIED IN USING DEADLY FORCE.
FOX25'S MICHAEL HENRICH LIVE AT
THE SILVER CITY GALLERIA WHERE IT HAPPENED.
THE REPORT HAD NEW DETAILS OF
THE MAN THAT CARRIED OUT THE ATTACK.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: WE LEARNED AGAIN
THAT THE ATTACKER ARTHUR DAROSA GAVE CONFLICTING ESTIMATES HIS
FAMILY AND TO THE EVALUATORS --
THE PROFESSIONAL EVALUATING AT THE HOSPITAL ABOUT HIS MENTAL
HEALTH AND MORE SO IN THIS
13-PAGE REPORT JUST ISSUED YESTERDAY BY THE BRISTOL COUNTY
DISTRICT ATTORNEY.
THE ENTIRE INVESTIGATION INTO THE RAMPAGE THAT ENDED HERE
BEHIND ME AT THE SILVER --
EXCUSE ME THE SILVER CITY GALLERIA MALL IN TAUNTON IN MAY
IS LAID OUT AND THE SHERIFF
DEPUTY THAT ENDED DAROSA'S LIFE WAS JUSTIFIED AND UNLAWFUL IN
DOING SO.
THE DA SAID THAT ARTHUR DAROSA STARTED THE RAMPAGE THAT KILLED
TWO PEOPLE, LEFT TWO OTHERS
STABBED AND MORE PEOPLE WOUNDED ON MYRICK STREET BACK ON MAY
10.
NOW THAT'S WHEN THE REPORT DETAILS HOW DAROSA CRASHED HIS
CAR, RAN INTO A RANDOM HOME AND
STABBED A MOTHER AND DAUGHTER KILLING AN 80-YEAR-OLD MOM.
THEN DROVE TO THE MALL, CRASHED
HIS CAR INTO MACY'S AND STARTED ASSAULTING PEOPLE BEFORE
RUNNING INTO THE BERTUCCI'S
RESTAURANT WHERE HE STABBED A PREGNANT WOMAN WOUNDING HER AND
FATALLY STABBED A MAN TRYING TO
COME TO THAT PREGNANT WOMAN'S AID.
THAT IS WHEN THE OFF-DUTY
PLYMOUTH COUNTY SHERIFF DEPUTY WHO HAPPENED TO BE EATING AT
THE RESTAURANT, APPROACHED,
SHOWED HIS BADGE, GAVE DEMANDS TO DAROSA TO PUT DOWN HIS KNIFE
AND FIRED A SINGLE ROUND THAT
PROVED FATAL AFTER DAROSA CONTINUED TOWARD HIM.
THE REPORT SAYS THAT THIS
SHERIFF DEPUTY LIKELY SPARED INJURY AND DEATH TO HIMSELF AND
THOSE AROUND HIM BECAUSE OF THE
ACTIONS HE TOOK. HE WILL SPEAK PUBLICLY ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED FOR THE FIRST
TIME LATER ON THIS MORNING, AND WE, OF COURSE, WILL BE THERE.

A SOMERSETLE IS SAFE AND SOUND
AFTER A PHONE SCHEME CONVINCED THEM THAT BOTH OF THEM HAD BEEN
KIDNAPPED.
A WOMAN GOT A CALL THAT GANG MEMBERS HAD TIED HER HUSBAND
OFF.
SHE WIRED MONEY TO PUERTO RICO AND WENT TO THE HOSPITAL TO
WAIT FOR HIM TO BE SHOWED OFF.
WHEN HE NEVER SHOWED UP, SHE CALLED HIM.
HE HAD BEEN WAITING FOR HER
BECAUSE HE WIRED MORE THAN $1,000 FOR HER RELEASE.
&gt;&gt; DON'T WIRE MONEY TO ANYONE.
DON'T GET A MONEY ORDER. DON'T SEND IT OUT OF THE

YOU GOT TO NOTIFY SOMEBODY. YOU CAN'T TAKE IT ON YOURSELF.

      <description>SIMILAR CALL.
&gt;&gt;&gt; WE ARE LOOKING FURTHER INTO
THE INVESTIGATIONS LAUNCHED AFTER DEADLY TRENCH COLLAPSE IN
BOSTON.
ROBERT GHOULSTON SHOWED US HOW A COMPANY WITH BAD SAFETY
RECORDS CONTINUES TO GET WORK
PERMITS. &gt;&gt; Reporter: TWO PEOPLE KILLED
UNDERGROUND WHILE OSHA IS
TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT WENT WRONG WITH THE ATLANTA DRAIN
PROJECT, OSHA IS ASKING
QUESTIONS, THEIR INVESTIGATION IS WHETHER CRIMINAL CHARGES ARE
WARRANTED.
AN COMPACTING PROCESS AND WHETHER THE MAN'S FAMILY AND
PUBLIC AT LARGE SHOULD FORCE
WITHOUT PREJUDGEMENT. THE HORRIFIC TRAGEDY HAS BOSTON
CITY COUNCILLORS TAKING NOTICE.
CITY COUNCILLOR MICHAEL FLARE TEE IS PUSHING FOR YOU TOUGHER
LAWS THAT ATLANTIC DRAIN GOT A
WORK PERMIT EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE ONE OF OSHA'S SEVERE
VIOLATORS WITH TENS OF
THOUSANDS IN UNPAID FINES. &gt;&gt; SO HE SHAH IS WAITING TO
COLLECT ON THIS BUT HAVEN'T
NOTIFIED A STATE OR INDUSTRY SAYING THIS IS A BAD
CONTRACTOR.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: OSHA SAY THEY POST THE RESULTS OF THEIR
INVESTIGATION ONLINE.
SAYING THIS IS THE MOST EFFICIENT MEANS OF NOTICE FOR A
WIDE AUDIENCE.
OSHA WILL CONTINUE OUTREACH EFFORTS AND THE GOVERNOR IS
LOOKING INTO THE ISSUE.
&gt;&gt; MAY BE THAT WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF COMMUNICATING
WITH OUR COLLEAGUES IN OUR
FEDERAL AND IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: WE REACHED OUT TO
THE OWNER ABOUT THE SAFETY VIOLATIONS AND THE COMPANY
REFERRED US TO AN ATTORNEY WHO
HE WAS JUST HIRED AND NOT READY TO COMMENT.

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; THE TWO PRESIDENT SHARP
CANDIDATES ARE SHOWING NO SIGN
OF SLOWING DOWN AS THEY HEAD TOWARD THE FINISH LINE.
MARY MALONEY REPORTS FROM THE
CAMPAIGN TRAIL. &gt;&gt; Reporter: LESS THAN TWO
WEEKS OF CAMPAIGNING LEFT,
HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP ARE SHOWING NO SIGNS OF
SLOWING.
&gt;&gt; LISTEN-ONLY MODE LISTENING TO DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN, I
TRULY DOUBT THAT HE HAS EVER
READ THE CONSTITUTION. &gt;&gt; HONESTLY, SHE HAS LESS
ENERGY THAN JEB BUSH.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: TRUMP DIDN'T JUST HAVE HARSH WORDS FOR CLINTON
BEFORE HEADING TO RALLIES.
HE HELD A OPENING CEREMONY AT HIS NEWEST LUXURY HOTEL AND
CHIDED IF HE WAS USING THE
STOCK FOR FREE PUBLICITY. &gt;&gt; YOU NEED TO ASK ME THAT
QUESTION IS REALLY INSULTING
BECAUSE HILLARY CLINTON DOES ONE STOP AND THEN GOES HOME AND
SLEEPS, YET YOU WILL ASK ME
THAT QUESTION. I THINK IT IS A VERY RUDE
QUESTION.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE AND DONALD TRUMP
SUPPORTER NEWT BEGINNING RUCHE
CALLED THE HOTEL SYMBOLIC OF WHAT TRUMP'S PRESIDENCY WILL
BE.
&gt;&gt; YOU CAN COME IN UNDER BUDGET AND AHEAD OF SCHEDULE IN THIS
CITY IS A REALLY RADICAL
MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; Reporter: CLINTON,
MEANWHILE, USED TRUMP'S MOMENT
TO BOOST HER OWN AGENDA, URGING VOTERS AT A FLORIDA RALLY NOT
TO FALL FOR THE HYPE.
&gt;&gt; IF YOU HAVE FRIENDS WHO ARE THINKING OF VOTING FOR TRUMP.
I WANT TO YOU TELL THEM THAT HE
RELIED ON UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS TO MAKE HIS PROJECT CHEAPER.
&gt;&gt; WHILE SHE MAY BE UP IN THE
POLLS, CLINTON ENCOURAGED HER SUPPORTERS TO MAKE SURE THEY
SUPPORT HER WHEN IT COUNTS.
&gt;&gt; DONALD TRUMP SAYS HE CAN STILL WIN, AND HE IS RIGHT.
IT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT
EVERYBODY GETS OUT AND VOTES.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; IT IS NOW SECRET THE BEAUTY
OF SALEM TURNS DARK AND
GHOULISH IN OCTOBER. FOX25'S BLAIR MILLER DISCOVERED
IN ADDITION TO EXTRA PATROLS,
POLICE SAY THEY ARE PREPARED FOR A NEW THREAT THAT HAS BEEN
SWEEPING ACROSS THE NATION.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: ALONG THE COBBLESTONES OF SALEM IT IS
HARD TO SEE THE STREETS ANY
OTHER WAY. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE FIVE SEASONS, FALL,
SPRING, SUMMER FALL AND THEN
OCTOBER. &gt;&gt; Reporter: THEY BRING IN
THEIR YEARLY BUSINESS THIS
MONTH, BUT IT IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE THE RECENT CLOWN CRAZE
PROMPTING SOME TOWNS LIKE SALEM
STEP UP SECURITY. &gt;&gt; A LITTLE MORE SECURITY.
I DON'T THINK IT IS A BAD
THING. &gt;&gt; Reporter: WITH MORE PEOPLE
IN LEADING UP TO HALLOWEEN,
THEY ARE WATCHING CLOSELY. TOWN MEMBER WANT EVERYONE TO
BEHAVE, CLOWN OR NOT.
&gt;&gt; THE CLOWN CRAZE IS WHAT IT IS.
JUST A CRAZE.
WE ARE NOT BANNING ANY CLOWN UNIFORMS OR SUITS.
WE ARE ASKING THAT ANYBODY JUST
BEHAVE APPROPRIATELY. &gt;&gt; Reporter: ADDED PATROLS
AROUND THE WHARF AREA.
BECAUSE THE 31st FALLS ON A MONDAY.
THEY KNOW THAT THE CELEBRATION
ALSO EXTEND FOR LONGER WEEKEND AND WITH THE SECURITY, LOCATION
LIKE MICHELLE BROWN WANT
HALLOWEEN TO STAY WHAT IT IS AND WHAT THEY WORKED SO HARD TO
HAVE.
&gt;&gt; YEARS AND YEARS AGO, HAUNTED HAPPENINGS, AND OVER THE YEARS,
THE CITY AND THE POLICE HAVE
DONE A FABULOUS JOB IN -- IN REALLY KEEPING THE SHENANIGANS
DOWN.
&gt;&gt; TALKING WITH POLICE TODAY, IT SEEMS LIKE THEY ARE ALMOST
MORE CONCERNED OF HOW PEOPLE
GET THERE. PARKING IN SALEM IS ALWAYS A
BIG ISSUE.
IF YOU WERE GOING TO AVOID DRIVING THERE, SAVE YOURSELF A
LOT OF TIME AND HEADACHES.

      <description>THE CASINO IS EXPECTED TO OPEN
BY SUMMER 2019.
&gt;&gt;&gt; COMMUNITIES ALONG THE MASSACHUSETTS COASTLINE ARE
TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO DEAL
WITH EMOTION. THE FOX25 SKY VISION DRONE
CAPTURED THIS VIDEO SHOWINGS
SOME OF THE TROUBLED AREAS. LEADERS MET IN SWITCH WITT TO
FIND A WAY TO DEAL WITH HIGHER
LEVELS. CREWS ARE REBUILDING THE TOWN'S
SEAWALL TO GET READY FOR
STORMS. THE CITY IS WORRIED PARTS COULD
END UP BECOMING AN ISLAND IF
THEY DON'T TAKE MORE ACTION. &gt;&gt; IF THAT TAKES PLACE, WE WILL
HAVE 60 HOMES THAT WILL BE OT

      <description>WOULD KNOCK WAVES DOWN BEFORE
THEY CAN EVEN HIT THE SEAWALL.
&gt;&gt;&gt; IT IS 4:46. TAKING A LOOK AT TRAFFIC AND
WEATHER TOGETHER EVERY TEN
MINUTES. THINGS STILL NICE AND QUIET ON
ROUTE 1 AND 93 SOUTH.
THOSE ICONS ARE OVERNIGHT CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS THAT WILL
WRAP UP BY 5 A.M.
PIKE MOVING ALONG FINE. LIVE DRIVE TIMES.
13 MINUTES FROM ROUTE 1 FROM
128 TO THE TOBIN. 19 MINUTES ON 93 SOUTH.
24 MINUTES ON THE PIKE AS YOU
HEAD EASTBOUND TOWARD MASS AVENUE.
METEOROLOGIST SHIRI SPEAR
JOINING US NOW. SHIR, OUR SECOND DAY OF
FREEZING TEMPERATURES AND SAFE
TO SAY THIS IS THE NEW NORMAL? &gt;&gt; THE NEW NORMAL AND A LITTLE
BELOW AVERAGE.
NOT THAT CRAZE THE TIME OF THE YEAR TO GET 20s AND 30s AND
TEMPERATURES SLIGHTLY BELOW
AVERAGE. I AM GOING TO SHAPE UP A LITTLE
BIT MIMEDER INTO THE WEEKEND
AND NEXT WEEK WHICH IS THE TREND I AM SEEING.
COLD ENOUGH THIS MORNING TO MIX
IN A CUP OF FLURRIES ALONG WITH THE SPRINKLES WE ARE SEEING
ALONG THE COASTLINE.
ACCUMULATION, THOUGH, WILL STAY IN THE MOUNTAINS.
EVEN IF YOU HAVE FLURRIES OUT
INTO THE MERRIMACK VALLEY OR UP TO THE NORTH SHORE OR OUT INTO
WORCESTER, IT IS JUST NOT GOING
TO VERY EFFECTIVELY STICK TODAY AND CHANGES TO RAIN A LITTLE
TOO QUICKLY.
CLEAR THE STORM TRAINS DRAINS FROM LEAVES SO YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY I SHALL ISSUES.
AND DAMAGING GUSTS YOU ARE WATCHING OVERNIGHT ESPECIALLY
FROM THE CAPE.
ALL THE COOL AIR PLANTED IN PLACE AND YOU CAN SEE WHAT WE
ARE GETTING IN NEW YORK AND
PENNSYLVANIA IS IN THE FORM OF SOME SNOW.
LOCALLY WE ARE SEEING A CUP OF
SPRINKLES AT THE COASTLINE. AS SOME OF THESE GAPS FILL IN,
TEMPERATURES WILL BE SAFELY
ABOVE FREEZING TODAY. JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU A
SNAPSHOT OF 7:00 THIS MORNING
BECAUSE WITH TEMPERATURES THE WAY THEY ARE RIGHT NOW,
ANYTHING FROM THE SOUTH SHORE
TO THE NORTH SHORE. INLAND, I THINK ANYTHING WE SEE
THERE WILL BE A LITTLE BIT OF A
MIX OR EVEN A LITTLE BIT OF SNOW IN THE FORM OF FLURRIES AS
I MENTIONED.
AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WILL BE WATCHING THROUGH THE
MORNING.
YOU CAN SEE BEST CHANCE FOR ANY KIND OF ACTIVITY IS GOING TO BE
ACROSS THE COASTLINE.
NOONTIME TEMPERATURES HERE IN THE 30s INTO CENTRAL
MASSACHUSETTS, PROBABLY UP INTO
SOUTHERN NEW HAMPSHIRE AS WELL, BUT COASTLINE IS WARMING INTO
THE LOW AND MID-40s HERE BY 3
P.M. MOST OF US ARE IN THE 40s HERE.
WORCESTER.
I KNOW IT SAYS 40. BUT YOU CAN SEE A LITTLE BIT OF
A SLOWER WARM-UP THAN WHAT WE
ARE SEEING HERE THAT GOES FOR CENTRAL MASS, MERRIMACK.
I THINK YOU WILL HAVE TO KEEP A
CLOSE EYE FOR MIXING ON THE ONSET OF THIS WHOLE THING.
3 P.M. GET READY FOR SCATTERED
SHOWERS. MILD ENOUGH AT 5 P.M. FOR THAT
DRIVE HOME FROM WORK THAT KEVIN
LEMANOWICZ WILL BE WATCHING FOR RAIN AND OVERNIGHT TONIGHT.
WE ARE TALKING OCCASIONALLY
HEAVY RAIN THAT WILL LAST US INTO THE FIRST HALF OF THE
MORNING COMMUTE TOMORROW.
SHOWERS SHOULD BE WINDING DOWN BY 8:00 IN THE MORNING.
MAIN TOTALS ARE PRETTY
IMPRESSIVE HERE. AN INCH OR SLIGHTLY MORE AREA
WIDE.
A GOOD RAIN. THAT DROUGHT MONITOR THAT COMES
OUT TODAY IN BETWEEN THE RAIN
THAT WE ALREADY HAVE THIS WEEK AND THE RAIN THAT WE ARE
GETTING HERE.
THIS IS ALL INCREDIBLY HELPFUL FOR THE DROUGHT SITUATION.
REMEMBER SNOW TOTALS OUT INTO
THE BERKSHIRES, MAYBE SOUTHWESTERN NEW HAMPSHIRE GETS
SOME MINIMAL ACCUMULATION
BEFORE THAT CHANGE OVER TO RAIN WASHES IT ALL AWAY FOR REST OF
THE AREA, CENTRAL, EASTERN
MASS. ONLY THE RISK FOR SOME FLURRIES
OUT THERE.
THIS AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES THAT GET INTO THE UPPER 40s OUT
ACROSS EASTERN MASSACHUSETTS.
I AM GOING TO GO WITH A LOT OF LOW AND MID-40s.
THE SEVEN-DAY FORECAST WITH THE
WEEKEND FALLS VIEW. A LITTLE MILDER TOMORROW AT 54.
IT GETS VERY GUSTY AND BREEZY
THOUGH AND STAYS THAT WAY THROUGH THE DAY AS WE DRY OUT
ON FRIDAY.
MOSTLY CLOUDY AND UPPER 50s WHICH IS NORMAL.
THE BEST CHANCE FOR SHOWERS
WILL BE ON SUNDAY AS OF NOW. NEXT WEEK SHAPING UP TO START
DRY.
BACK TO YOU.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt; Daniel:  ALL RIGHT, SHIRI,
THANK YOU.
&gt;&gt;&gt; A LOT OF EXPECTATION FOR THE CELTICS AND AFTER ONE GAME,
A LOT TO BE EXCITED ABOUT.
MADE HIS DEBUT AT THE GARDEN. CELTICS TAKING ON THE KNICKS.
A QUIET NIGHT SCORING 11 POINTS
AND GRABBING FIVE REBOUNDS, BUT HE ONLY HAD TO PLAY 27 MINUTES.
THE CELTICS HAD A BIG
SECOND-HALF LEAD AND THE NETS MADE IT CLOSE AT THE END.
THE FINAL SCORE 122-117.
WOFFO ARE, D THE BIG STORY GOING IN BUT TWO CELTIC FANS
STOLE THE NIGHT.
TWO FLEW ALL FROM AUSTRALIA FOR OPENING NIGHT BUT NOT JUST TO
SEE THE GAME.
JAMIE GOT ON ONE KNEE TO PROPOSE.
SHE SAID YES.
MADDIE TOLD FOX25 THAT SHE WAS SURPRISED.
&gt;&gt; NAMEY IS A DIE-HARD CELTICS
FAN. I AM THINKING HE SOMEHOW
MANAGED TO GET PHOTOS -- THIS
IS HIS DREAM COME TRUE TO BE HERE TONIGHT SO I WASN'T
EXPECTING IT AT ALL.
IT WAS JUST -- I AM SO IN SHOCK!
&gt;&gt; Daniel:  WHAT A TRIP.
JAMIE TOLD FOX25 AFTER MONTHS OF E-MAILS BACK AND FORTH WITH
THE CELTICS, EVERYTHING WENT
OFF WITHOUT A HITCH. I WOULD SAY SO.
&gt;&gt; Julie:  GOOD FOR THEM AND
COOL TO HAVE CELTICS REPRESENTATION.

DUE IMAGINE THAT LONG FLIGHT FROM STRAIL KNOWING WHAT HE IS
ABOUT TO DO.

      <description>ONE MOTHER TOLD FOX25'S
ELIZABETH HOPKINS WATCHING IT
HAPPEN TO HER SON WAS THE MOST GUT-WRENCHING THING SHE HAS
EVER SEEN.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: HE IS A CURIOUS ... SMART.
&gt;&gt; MOO!
&gt;&gt; Reporter: AND ENERGETIC 2-YEAR-OLD.
IT TAKES A MOMENT FOR YOU TO
REALIZE THAT MATH KNEW IS NOT LIKE OTHER KIDS HIS AGE AND
THAT STORY IS A SOURCE OF
HEARTBREAK FOR HIS PARENTS. &gt;&gt; YOU WATCH YOUR CHILD AND YOU
CAN'T HELP THEM.
NOT LIKE HE IS JUST SICK. HE IS PARALYZED AND I CAN'T
MAKE IT BETTER.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: HER SON HAD BEEN PERFECTLY HEALTHY BUT ONE DAY
PLAYING OUTSIDE IN JUNE,
SOMETHING CHANGED. &gt;&gt; ALL OF A SUDDEN WE BOTH
LOOKED BACK AND HE WAS FROZEN.
IT WAS LIKE HE HIT A WALL OR SOMETHING.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: MATTHEW'S ARM WENT
LIMP. LATER HIS LEG.
DOCTORS EVENTUALLY DIAGNOSED
HIM WITH FLACCID MYELITIS, A VIRUS THAT INFLAMES THE SPINAL
CORD.
IT IS DESCRIBED AS A POLIO-LIKE SYNDROME LEAVING CHILDREN
PARALYZED.
DOCTORS KNOW LITTLE ABOUT IT. &gt;&gt; THEY KNOW WHAT IT IS BUT
DON'T KNOW HOW THIS CURE IT.
TOUGH TO TAKE IT AS A PARENT. &gt;&gt; Reporter: THEY HAVE SEEN
HUNDREDS OF THESE MYSTERIOUS
CASES BREAK OUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN CHILDREN UNDER THE
AGE OF 12.
THE DOCTOR SAYS THE PHENOMENON IS SO NEW, DOCTORS ARE WORKING
TO UNDERSTAND IT.
&gt;&gt; UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS, UNFORTUNATELY, NO PERFECT
ANSWER.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: SHE SAYS SCIENTISTS ARE WORKING TO
EVENTUALLY DEVELOP A VACCINE.
FOR NOW THE PLAN FOR MATTHEW IS REGULAR THERAPY.
THE PLAN FOR HIS PARENTS IS TO
HOLD ON TO HOPE. &gt;&gt; NOBODY KNOWS WHEN IT WILL BE
BETTER OR IF IT EVER WILL BE.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: ELIZABETH HOPKINS, FOX25 NEWS.
&gt;&gt; Julie:  TREATING MATTHEW HAS
BECOME VERY EXPENSIVE. THE FAMILY SAID THEY HAD TO
BATTLE THEIR INSURANCE COMPANY
FOR ENOUGH COVERAGE. THEY SET UP A GO FUND ME
ACCOUNT TO HELP PAY THE BILLS.

      <description>MANAGER THEO EPSTEIN IS PAYING
UP BIG FOR THE CUBS.
&gt;&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR JOINING US THIS THURSDAY OCTOBER 27  HOPE
YOUR MORNING IS YOU OFF TO A
GREAT START. I AM GENE LAVANCHY.
&gt;&gt; Sara:  I AM SARA UNDERWOOD.
GRAB YOUR GLOVES AND AN EXTRA COAT AND.
IT IS EVEN COLD ENOUGH FOR A
LITTLE SNOW. PLEASE DON'T SAY THAT.
&gt;&gt; Shiri:  DID I SAY THAT WORD?
DID THE "S" WORD COME OUT OF OUR MOUTHS.
SNOW ACROSS NEW YORK,
PENNSYLVANIA. CLEARLY IT IS COLD ENOUGH TO
GET SNOW HERE EVEN INTO NEW
ENGLAND TODAY. ALL WE ARE DEALING WITH RIGHT
NOW ARE A COUPLE OF SPRINKLES
AND DRIZZLE FROM PLYMOUTH DOWN TO THE CAPE AND ISLANDS.
TEMPERATURES THERE MOSTLY UPPER
30s TO LOWER 40s. I AM A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT
THAT 31 IN PLYMOUTH THAT TELLS
ME THAT PARTS OF TOWN OR MAYBE EVEN A CAR SERVICE WHICH TENDS
TO GET VERY COLD DOES HAVE THE
POTENTIAL FOR A LITTLE BIT OF GLAZE.
CHECK THAT OUT 26 IN BEDFORD,
30 IN BEVERLY HAD THIS MORNING. 31 IN WORCESTER.
IT IS VERY COLD OUT THERE AS
OUR DAY GETS STARTED. WANT TO BREAK DOWN WORCESTER'S
TIMELINE BECAUSE WORCESTER WILL

      <description>COLD ENOUGH FOR A LITTLE SNOW
IN PARTS OF NEW ENGLAND BEFORE
THINGS TURN SOAKING WET. &gt;&gt; Shiri:  YOU SEE THAT WITH
THIS BATCH OF SHOW MOVING
THROUGH NEW YORK. PRETTY CHILLY TEMPERATURES IN
PLACE.
ALL WE HAVE LOCALLY A COUPLE OF SPRINKLES IMPACTING THE CAPE
WHERE WE HAVE THICKER CLOUDS.
DOWN TOWARD HYANNIS DON'T BE SURPRISED TO SEE A QUICK LITTLE
SPRITZ.
35 IN BOSTON BUT IT IS FREEZING RIGHT NOW IN PLYMOUTH.
FREEZING UP TO BEVERLY,
LAWRENCE AND WORCESTER. WE HAVE PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES TO
GET THINGS STARTED BUT MOST OF
US WILL START THE DAY DRY HERE AND THROUGH 9 A.M., THE
POTENTIAL FOR NOT JUST FROSTY
TEMPERATURES BUT FREEZING TEMPERATURES OUT THERE.
HERE IS WORCESTER TODAY, AND
YOU CAN SEE IT IS REAL TOUGH TO WARM THINGS UP.
IN WORCESTER, WE ONLY GET INTO
THE LOWER 40s. AS RAIN DEVELOPS BETWEEN 2 AND
3:00 THIS AFTERNOON IT WILL BE
A VERY COLD RAIN. AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A CUP OF
FLURRIES UP AHEAD OF THAT MAIN
BATCH OF SHOWERS. WE HAVE AN HOUR-BY-HOUR LOOK AT
FUTURECAST AND WHO GETS TO SNOW
TODAY WHEN THE RAIN MOVES IN FOR YOU COMING UP IN 10.

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; PASSENGERS JUMPING OUT OF
TRAIN WINDOWS TO A PLATFORM
FULL OF SMOKE DESTROYED THE EVENING COMMUTE FOR THOUSANDS
OF PEOPLE.
MANY OF WHOM WILL PASS THROUGH THE VERY SAME STATION TODAY
DURING THE MORNING RUSH HOUR.
THIS MORNING THE MBTA IS BLAMING THE SMOKE ON ONE THE
CAR'S MOTORS.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS WHAT THE T IS TELLING US 4:39  NOTIFIED OF A
PROPULSION ISSUE AT BACK BAY.
TWO MINUTES LATER PASSENGERS STARTED JUMPING OUT OF THE
WINDOWS TO ESCAPE THE SMOKE.
THREE PEOPLE GOT HURT AND THE MBTA ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT WENT WRONG.
OUR CHRISTINE McCARTHY SPOKE TO SEVERAL RIDERS OF THE CHAOS
INSIDE THOSE TRAINS.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: CHAOS DURING THE COMMUTE.
RIDERS LEASED FROM WINDOWS OF
AN ORANGE LINE TRAIN AS THE BACK BAY.FILLED WITH SMOKE.
&gt;&gt; IT WAS STRESSFUL.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON.
PEOPLE YELLING THERE WAS A
FIRE. &gt;&gt; Reporter: BRIE GRABBED HER
CELL PHONE AND STARTED
RECORDING FROM INSIDE. THE DOORS WOULDN'T OPEN, SO
ANOTHER RIDER STEPPED UP.
&gt;&gt; SOMEBODY SMASHED A WINDOW AND THEY KICKED IT OUT.
AND WE ALL JUMPED OUT OF THE T
THROUGH THE WINDOW. &gt;&gt; Reporter: ANOTHER PASSENGER
SHOT THIS VIDEO AS THE GROUP
SCRAMBLED UP THE STAIRS. SKYFOX CAPTURED FIRE FIGHTERS
RESPONDING TO HELP PASSENGERS
EVACUATE. THREE PEOPLE SUFFERED MINOR
INJURIES AND MBTA OFFICIALS SAY
-- &gt;&gt; IT WAS KIND OF HARD TO
BREATHE AND SEE.
PRETTY THICK SMOKE. KIND OF CONCERNING.
PEOPLE WERE COUGHING AND
PANICKING. &gt;&gt; Reporter: THE T IS
INVESTIGATING BUT OFFICIALS SAY
THE ISSUE WAS LIKELY A MOTOR PROBLEM.
&gt;&gt; THE FIRST THING I THOUGHT
WAS WHAT WAS GOING ON. &gt;&gt; Reporter: MICHAEL MYERS SAID
A SITUATION HE NEVER BEFORE
WITNESSED. &gt;&gt; WE WERE ALL GROUPED UP IN
ONE SPACE.
WE WERE ALL RUNNING UP THE ESCALATOR.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: BUT FOR SHELLY,
THE THIRD TIME SHE EXPERIENCED SMOKE ON THE T AND HOPES THIS
PROBLEM IS FIXED SOON.
&gt;&gt; I HOPE THE T GETS SPECIAL ATTENTION.
A LOT OF US USE IT EVERY SINGLE
DAY WERE REPORT AT THE BACK BAY STATION, CHRISTINE McCARTHY.
&gt;&gt; AS TO WHY THE DOORS DID NOT
OPEN AWAY. IT WAS INTENTIONAL NOT AN
ACCIDENT.
PEOPLE WERE MOVING AWAY FROM THE PLATFORM AND IF THEY JUMPED
OUT RIGHT AWAY, IT WOULD HAVE
LANDED ON THE LIVE THIRD RAIL. ONCE IT WAS SAFE THEY OPENED
THE DOORS.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: NOT THE FIRST TIME PASSENGERS KNOCKED OUT WINDOWS
TO ESCAPE A TRAIN.
THIS IS VIDEO FROM THE WINTER WHEN A PANEL FELL OFF AND IT
LANDED ON THE TRACK CAUSING THE
TRAIN TO GRIND TO A HALT AND CAUSED SMOKE TO FELT NEARBY
STATE STATE STATION.
&gt;&gt; Daniel:  THE T TOLD US THAT PANEL FELL OFF BECAUSE IT
SIMPLY DETERIORATED.
IT WAS OLD. IT TURNS OUT OLD LINE TRAINS
ARE SOME OF THE OLDER IN THE
FLEET. THEY DATE BACK TO THE 1970s AND
NEVER HAVE BEEN RELEASED AS YOU
CAN SEE. WE CONFIRMED WITH THE MBTA THAT
100 ORANGE LINE TRAINS ARE
EXPECTED TO BE REPLACED IN</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; IT IS 4:14 RIGHT NOW.
DRACUT WOMAN WITH ALZHEIMER'S
WHO SURVIVED 671 HOURS IN THE COLD IS GETTING TREATMENT THIS
MORNING AT A LOWELL HOSPITAL.
FOX25'S MALINI BASU SPOKE TO THAT WOMAN'S FAMILY WHO SAYS
SHE IS QUITE THE FIGHTER.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: FOR THREE FULL DAYS, KATHY LUCIER WAS NOWHERE
TO BE FOUND.
THE DRACUT WOMAN'S FAMILY FEARED THE WORST.
AN OFF-DUTY FIRE FIGHTER FOUND
HER. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN ASK HER QUESTIONS
AND SHE TRIES TO ANSWER.
&gt;&gt; YOU THE TRUE DEFINITION A FIGHTER.
THERE IS NO OTHER DEFINITION.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: A FIGHTER FOUND TUCK AID WAY UNDER THE TARP OF
A NEIGHBOR'S BOAT.
THE 75-YEAR-OLD SURD VIVD TEMPERATURES IN THE 30s.
WE ASKED DR. BITNER FROM MASS
GENERAL HOW IT IS POSSIBLE TO SURVIVE UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS.
&gt;&gt; DRINKING WATER IN THAT
48-HOUR WINDOW IS IMPORTANT. THE WAY SHE WAS ABLE TO HIDE
HERSELF GAVE A LITTLE WARM
POCKET OF AIR AND GAVE HER SOME PROTECTION AND AWAY FROM THE
WIND.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: LUCIER SUFFERS FROM PARKINSON'S AND DEMENTIA,
DESPITE THAT SHE WAS CARRYING
AROUND A BOWL AND A SPOON. OFF-DUTY FIRE FIGHTER SPOTTED
THAT BOWL.
&gt;&gt; I SAW THE BOWL. IT WAS JUST ON THE SCENE.
THERE IS NO WAY -- THAT IS THE
BOWL THAT JUST HAPPENED TO BE RIGHT BY MY HOUSE, AND HOPPED A
CUP OF FENCES AND WE FOUND HER.
&gt;&gt; TO JUSTIN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
TO EVERYBODY, THANK YOU VERY
MUCH. &gt;&gt; Reporter: NOW FAMILY MEMBERS
ARE BY HER SIDE.
&gt;&gt; SHE IS NOT EATING BUT SHE IS TAKING IV FLUIDS AND JUST AN
EVALUATION PROCESS IS ONGOING.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: LUCIER IS TRYING TO TALK AND ANSWER QUESTIONS,
BUT IF YOU MENTION THE WORD ICE
CREAM. &gt;&gt; I SAID KATHY, YOU MISSED
THREE DAYS OF ICE CREAM AND SHE
RAISED HER RIGHT EYEBROW, COULD YOU TELL SHE KNEW WHAT I WAS
TALKING ABOUT.
&gt;&gt; Daniel:  WE ARE VERY HAPPY SHE HAS BEEN FOUND.
HER HER IS BY HER -- HER
HUSBAND IS BY HER BEDSIDE WHICH IS A COMFORT AND SHE WILL BE IN
THE HOSPITAL AS DOCTORS AND
NURSES EVALUATE HER.</description>

      <description>TOLLS.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 4:17 ON THIS THURSDAY
MORNING. IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT OUT TO --
GONE OUT TO GET HATS SCARS OF.
YOU BETTER GET THEM. &gt;&gt; Julie:  BITTERLY COLD
SHIRI MANY OF YOU COLDER THAN
YESTERDAY. COLDEST DAY OF FALL.
A FROST ADVISORY FOR MOST.
 IMMEDIATE COAST INLAND WHERE YOU SEE THE PURPLES AND FURTHER
WEST OF THAT A FREEZE WARNING.
FROSTY, FREEZING TEMPERATURES. 20s AND 30s AS YOU WAKE UP THIS
MORNING.
FOR MANY OF US COLD ENOUGH FOR SNOW, WE JUST DON'T HAVE ANY
PRECIPITATION HERE YET, AND WE
ARE BE WEEDING OUT THE COLD AS IT MOVES IN WHICH IS WHY MOST
OF US SIMPLY END UP WITH RAIN
TODAY. NOTICE THOSE FUTURE CAST IS
BRINGING IN A COUPLE OF MORNING
SPRINKLES. I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THEY
ARE FLURRIES IN SOME TOWNS,
ESPECIALLY FROM THE SOUTH SHORE OVER TO THE NORTH SHORE IF
ANYTHING GETS INLAND.
POTENTIAL OF ONE OR TWO FLURRIES.
NOTHING STICKY OR GOING TO MAKE
A MESS OF THE MORNING COMMUTE. SO WE HAVE A LOT OF CLOUDS
AROUND TODAY.
CLOUDS WILL THICKEN UP PRETTY QUICKLY APPEAR A GLIMPSE OF
BLUE SKIES AND COUNT ON THINGS.
WE HAVE THE FIRST OF REAL RAIN STARTING TO POP UP.
MY ONLY CONCERN IF IT IS SLOW
TO WARM UP A BIT OF CONCERN INTO SOUTHERN NEW HAMPSHIRE
INITIALLY HERE.
BY THE EVENING COMMUTE. AS THE PACE OF THESE SHOWERS IS
PICKING UP, PLAIN RAIN.
OUT TO THE BERKSHIRES AND TRAVELLING TO WESTERN MASS,
THAT IS WHERE THE FOCUS OF OUR
KNOW IS GOING TO REMAIN. OVERNIGHT, WE CONTINUE WITH THE
HEAVY RAIN AT TIMES, AND IF YOU
ARE PART OF THE EARLY MORNING COMMUTE TOMORROW, I THINK IT IS
REALLY GOING TO BE THE WORSE
HERE, PROBABLY 4, 5, 6:00 IN THE MORNING.
BY 8 A.M. MOST OF THE SHOWERS
GONE IN SOUTHERN CAPE. EVEN THOSE LOCATIONS DRYING
OUT.
GOING TO BE VERY WINDY. HEAVY RAIN GOING TO BE OUR
BIGGEST WEATHER THREAT.
THINGS GET WINDY TONIGHT AND TOMORROW AND WE WILL HAVE TO
CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL FOR WIND
DAMAGE ACROSS THE CAPE. SNOW HAZARD TODAY IS GOING TO
BE LOW.
A CUP OF MORNING FLURRIES AREN'T GOING TO CAUSE ANY
PROBLEMS.
NOT LIKE YOU ARE GOING INTO THE MOUNTAINS THAT YOU FIND SOME
ACCUMULATION UP TO THE
BERKSHIRES, WESTERN MASS A COUPLE OF INCHES POSSIBLE AND
COULD END UP WITH A COATING AND
SOME THICKING OUT INTO SOUTHWESTERN NEW HAMPSHIRE.
BEFORE WE FLIP OVER TO RAIN,
TRACKING A COUPLE OF EARLY MORNING FLURRIES AND AT LEAST
THE POTENTIAL FOR THAT.
20s 3507BDs ON THE MAP. FREEZING IN PLYMOUTH.
FITCHBURG AT 30 DEGREES AND
HERE YOU CAN SEE WE ARE STARTING OUT WITH MOSTLY CLEAR
SKIES.
IN COME THOSE CLOUDS AND BY 2:00 THIS AFTERNOON, WE ARE
LOOKING AT TEMPERATURES INTO
THE 40s WHICH IS GOING TO BE WARM ENOUGH FOR HOPEFULLY JUST
ALL RAIN OUT OF THIS WHOLE
THING. HIGH TEMPERATURES ARE GOING TO
BE WARMEST OUT IN BOSTON WHERE
WE COULD SEE A COUPLE OF 50s OUT THERE.
A LITTLE SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE
50s. END UP WITH A LOT OF MIDDLE
PERHAPS UPPER 40s AT THE
COASTLINE, CENTRAL MASS, SOUTHERN NEW HAMPSHIRE.
YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO BE
STALLING OUT IN THE LOW TO MIDDLE 40S. LOW TEMPERATURES
NOT TOO BAD AND STICKING WITH
ALL RAIN AND FOR THE DAY TOMORROW, WE HAVE HIGHS BACK UP
TO AROUND 50 DEGREES AND STILL
SOME OF YOU STUCK IN THE UPPER 40s.
46 TODAY, DEVELOPING RAIN, RAIN
INTO YOUR MORNING COMMUTE TOMORROW.
54 DEGREES.
TURNING WINDY. OVER THE WEEKEND, RAIN CHANCES,
MOSTLY NOW ON SUNDAY.
THAT HAS FLIPPED SINCE YESTERDAY.
SATURDAY LOOKS LIKE THE DRIER
DAY. ONLY THE SLIGHT RISK AND
REMAINING MOSTLY CLOUDY.
BACK TO YOU GUYS.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; CHECK THIS OUT.
THE STATE SENT US THIS ANIMATED
VIDEO WHAT IT WILL LOOK LIKE WHEN TOLL BOOTHS COME DOWN AND
TRAFFIC IS MOVING SMOOTHLY WITH
ELECTRONIC TOLLS. DRIVERS ARE BEING WARNED FOR A
VERY SLOW COMMUTE.
AS FOX25'S TED DANIEL REPORTS, DRIVERS SHOULD GET INTO A SNOW
TYPE OF MIND.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: A SLOW RIDE ON THE PIKE OUT OF THE WESTON TOLLS.
THINGS ARE ABOUT TO CHANGE.
HOW DO 23 SIMULTANEOUS WORK ZONES FROM BOSTON TO THE NEW
YORK BORDER SOUND?
&gt;&gt; OH, MY GOODNESS, NO WAY. DEFINITELY NOT GOING TO TAKE
THE PIKE THEN.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THE WORST OF IT WILL BE SCHEDULED UNTIL TWO
DAYS BEFORE THANKSGIVING.
&gt;&gt; I AM PROBABLY GOING TO HAVE TO PLAN A LOT OF TIME TO GET
HERE EARLIER.
THAT IS A LONG TIME. &gt;&gt; Reporter: STARTS FRIDAY
NIGHT.
WORK CREWS WILL REROUTE TRAFFIC ALSTON-BRIGHTON OF TOLL PLAZAS
AND DEMOLITION IS EXPECTED TO
BEGIN SUNDAY. &gt;&gt; IF YOU HAVE TO DRIVE, LEAVE
YOURSELF PLENTY OF TIME.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: WANTS PIKE TRAVELERS TO KNOW THE MASSIVE
PROJECT WILL IMPACT THEM.
&gt;&gt; LEAVE YOURSELF PLENTY OF TIME.
MAYBE THINK ABOUT AN
ALTERNATIVE WORK SCHEDULE IF YOU CAN DO IT.
MAYBE THINK OF A DIFFERENT WAY
TO GET TO WORK IF YOU CAN DO IT.
TAKE THE MBTA IF YOU CAN DO
THAT. &gt;&gt; Reporter: IT WILL ALL BE
WORTH IT IN THE END.
THE END, IT WON'T COME UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR.
PETER BROWN, ONE OF THE MANY
PEOPLE PICKING UP AN E-ZPASS AT THE NATICK WEST AREA.
&gt;&gt; JUST FOR FLOW OF TRAFFIC I
THINK IT IS A WONDERFUL IDEA. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS TED DANIEL
REPORTING.
MORE DETAILS ON TOLL BOOTH DEMOLITION.
9:45 TOLLS WILL STOP BEING
COLLECTED AT TOLL BOOTHS. THEN AT 10 ALL ELECTRONIC
TOLLING WILL GO LIVE.
PREPARATION FOR DEMOLITION THROUGH LATE SUNDAY WHEN
CONSTRUCTION WILL ACTUALLY
BEGIN. THE SPEED LIMIT WILL BE 15
MILES PER HOUR THROUGH THE
CONSTRUCTION ZONE, AND WATCH THAT SPEED.
MORE THAN 100 POLICE DETAILS
WILL BE OUT WHEN THE NEW SYSTEM GOES LIVE FRIDAY NIGHT.

      <description>BREAK DOWN THE BEST ON THE WEB,
INCLUDING A RIDE IN A LAMBO.
SEE WHAT IT TAKES TO BEAT THE G-FORCES.
&gt;&gt; OH, HER SEAT BELT GAVE.
&gt;&gt; ALL THE ROMANTICS IN THE WORLD ARE GOING TO CRINGE AT
THIS ONE.
THE DESPAIR AND SADNESS, DISBELIEF.
IN PERU, HE WAITED THERE FOR A
DATE ON THE STREETS WITH AN ENORMOUS STUFFED TEDDY BEAR, A
BOUQUET OF FLOWERS.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS A FIRST. &gt;&gt; I DO BELIEVE THIS IS A FIRST
DATE.
&gt;&gt; HONESTLY, IF I'M CROSSING THE ROAD OR WALKING DOWN THE STREET
AND SEE A GIGANTIC BEAR, I
IMMEDIATELY DO A 180 AND USAIN BOLT RIGHT OUT OF THERE.
&gt;&gt; TEDDY BEARS ARE CUTE AND
SWEET. &gt;&gt; LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
LATIN AMERICANS LIKE THE
ROMANCE, OKAY? &gt;&gt; HOW DOES IT GO?
&gt;&gt; NOT WELL.
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THIS KID HAS BEEN THERE, BUT IT WAS LONG
ENOUGH FOR THIS PERSON TO START
LIVE BROADCASTING. OVER AN HOUR LONG.
SHE STOOD HIM UP?
&gt;&gt; YOU THINK? &gt;&gt; AT LEAST GET TO KNOW THE
GUY.
FIND OUT IF HE IS MENTAL. YOU KNOW?
&gt;&gt; GUY GIVES YOU A TEDDY BEAR ON
THE FIRST DATE, WHY WOULD HE GIVE THAT?
&gt;&gt; 100 POUNDS OF TEDDY BEAR?
&gt;&gt; I WOULD BE SO EXCITED. I LOVE THEM.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING, A
CROWD STARTS TO GATHER. AT ONE POINT EVEN TAKING A
PICTURE WITH HIM.
&gt;&gt; LOOK, BRO, IT'S DONE. IT'S OVER.
GO HOME.
GET ON TINDER. &gt;&gt; EVENTUALLY HE DOES FINALLY
CALL A CAB.
&gt;&gt; EXTRA LARGE CAR. &gt;&gt; HE GRABS HIS TEDDY BEAR.
WHEN THE CAR GETS THERE, YES, HE
DOES STRUGGLE TO GET IT IN. THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE THERE
ENCOURAGING HIM AND TELLING HIM
DON'T LOSE HOPE, YOU'LL BE FINE, BRO, BUT AT THIS POINT THIS KID
IS HEART BROKEN.
&gt;&gt; TEDDY BEARS.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt; SHUT IT.
&gt;&gt;&gt; MOST PEOPLE WE KNOW ABOUT
THE SHOW ON STORM CHASING RELATES TO GUYS WHO LIKE TO GO
OUT AND GET GREAT VIDEO.
THIS TIME STORM CHASING IS DIFFERENT AND COMPETITIVE.
THE RED BULL STORM CHASE 2017 IS
BACK. WHAT THEY DO IS TAKE EIGHT OF
THE WORLD'S BEST WIND SURFERS
AND WAIT UNTIL THE LARGEST STORM OF THE SEASON HITS THE NORTHERN
HEMISPHERE AND SEND THEM OUT.
WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR IS 55 TO 65 MILE PER HOUR WINDS.
SEE IF THEY CAN TAME THE BEAST.
&gt;&gt; FLYING AT CERTAIN POINTS IN THIS VIDEO.
LOOK AT THAT.
&gt;&gt; IT'S INSANE. I DON'T KNOW HOW THESE GUYS
MANAGE TO EVEN RIDE OUT THERE,
TO GET ONBOARD, TO HANDLE THE EXTREME SPEEDS, THE HIGH WAVES.
&gt;&gt; THEY ARE CHEATING DEATH.
&gt;&gt; THE WAITING PERIOD STARTS JANUARY 9th.
FROM THERE, THEY ARE JUST
WATCHING THE WEATHER. THEY ARE WAITING FOR IT TO GET
HORRIBLE.
THAT INDICATES PERFECT CONDITIONS AND SEND THE GUYS
OUT.
THIS IS NUTS. &gt;&gt; HOW AMAZING, RIGHT?
WHAT AN AMAZING FEAT FOR ALL OF
THESE ATHLETES. THEY MUST GO HOME WITH BRUISES.
&gt;&gt; THEY WERE HAVING TROUBLE EVEN
WALKING UP THE BEACH. &gt;&gt; NOW THIS IS CRAZY.
LET ME BE CLEAR, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN, THE FIVE FINGER DISCOUNT DOES NOT APPLY TO THE
POLICE.
&gt;&gt; OR ANYONE. &gt;&gt; BUT SPECIFICALLY THE POLICE.
THESE COPS IN COSTA RICA
APPARENTLY DIDN'T GET THE MESSAGE.
THEY GOT A CALL ABOUT A SHOP
THAT HAD BEEN BURGLARIZED. THINGS WEREN'T THERE, NEITHER
WERE THE OWNERS.
THIS IS WHAT WAS CAPTURED, ONE OF THE POLICE OFFICERS STICKS
HIS HAND IN THERE, GRABS A PIECE
OF THE ELECTRONICS. &gt;&gt; OH, MY GOD, YOU IDIOT.
YOU'RE A POLICE OFFICER.
DON'T YOU KNOW THERE'S CAMERAS? &gt;&gt; NO.
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE A DIRT BAG.
I'M GLAD THIS HAPPENED. GET THE GUY OFF THE STREETS.
&gt;&gt; GOES BACK IN FOR MORE.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S CRAZY. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS BAD.
YOU HAVE BEEN BURGLARED.
&gt;&gt; IT'S BAD ENOUGH THERE'S ONE OFFICER INVOLVED IN THIS.
&gt;&gt; THIS JUST RUINS ALL TRUST.
WHO DO YOU TURN TO IF THIS IS THE AMOUNT AND LEVEL OF
CORRUPTION.
&gt;&gt; THEY DIDN'T GET AWAY WITH THIS.
THE OFFICERS INVOLVED HAVE BEEN
FIRED. THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO FACE A
JUDGE IN COURT.
THE ORIGINAL BURGLARS HAVEN'T BEEN CAUGHT, BUT THIS IS JUST
BAD NEWS ALL AROUND.
THE NEXT VIDEO TAKES PLACE IN A JEWELRY STORE.
RIGHT BEHIND ARE THREE MASKED
MEN CARRYING A BASEBALL BAT, GUN, MACHETE.
TRYING TO FORCE HER TO OPEN UP
THE SAFE. &gt;&gt; YIKES.
&gt;&gt; WHEN THE MANAGER JUMPS INTO
ACTION, PUSHES THEM TO SAFETY, IT'S THE MAN THAT'S WORKED AT
THIS BUSINESS FOR 24 YEARS AND
HE'S LIKE, NO, GET OUT! SHOVES HIM OUT THE DOOR.
RUN OUT THE DOOR, POP IN THE CAR
AND TAKE OFF. THEY DID GET AWAY.
THEY STOLE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
OF MERCHANDISE BUT THE OWNERS SAY THEY WON'T GET FAR TRYING TO
SELL IT BECAUSE OTHER FOLKS IN
THE AREA WILL PROBABLY RECOGNIZE</description>

&gt;&gt;&gt; THIS POOR LITTLE CREATURE IS
CAESAR. HE IS A YORKIE AND HE'S BEEN
RESCUED FROM A PUPPY HILL, WHERE
HE WAS USED TO BREED OVER AND OVER.
AND THIS POOR CREATURE IS NOW
GETTING A NEW LEASH ON LIFE, BECAUSE HE'S BEEN RESCUED BY
LET'S ADOPT INTERNATIONAL.
LET'S ADOPT INTERNATIONAL RELIES ON DONATIONS SO THEY ARE ABLE TO
TAKE THESE DOGS IN AND CLEAN
THEM UP. AS YOU CAN SEE, THIS DOG HAD
MATTED LONG HAIR AND NEEDED TO
BE GROOMED IMMEDIATELY. THE FIRST THING THEY DO IS START
CUTTING THAT EXTRA HAIR OFF
CAESAR'S BODY. &gt;&gt; LOOK AT THE LACK OF RESPECT
FOR THE WAY THEY TREAT THESE
ANIMALS JUST TO KEEP MAKING THEIR DOLLARS.
&gt;&gt; AS THEY GET AROUND THE EYES,
LOOK HOW LONG THAT IS. HOW CAN THE DOG SEE ANYTHING?
AND THAT'S PAINFUL, THAT MATTED
HAIR LIKE THAT. THEY FINALLY DECIDE, OKAY, WE'VE
GOT ENOUGH HAIR OFF, LET'S GIVE
THIS FELLA A BATH. &gt;&gt; MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE, WOW,
WOW.
THIS IS THE LIFE. THIS IS GREAT.
&gt;&gt; GOT TO FEEL GOOD.
&gt;&gt; MORE THAN ANYTHING, JUST FEELS GOOD TO GET THE WEIGHT
OFF.
JUST TO HAVE THE HUMAN TOUCH. CARING TOUCH.
&gt;&gt; YOU HOPE IN ANY KIND OF
RESCUE THAT THEY HAVE A FOREVER HOME.
YOU'VE GOT ONE ALREADY.
CAESAR IS GOING TO LIVE MERRILY EVER AFTER WITH LOTS OF BELLY
RUBS, I BELIEVE.

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; I'M A BIG FAN OF THE
OUTDOORS.
I LOVE HANGING OUT OUTSIDE. THIS SPORT, THOUGH, ESCAPES ME.
I DON'T QUITE SEE THE APPEAL OF
ICE FISHING. THESE TWO GUYS ICE FISHING IN
NEBRASKA IN THIS VIDEO.
&gt;&gt; I'M WITH YOU, NICK, I HATE THE COLD.
I DON'T WANT TO BE COLD.
I WANT TO BE COZY. &gt;&gt; THING ABOUT THIS, THOUGH,
ULTIMATELY YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE ABLE TO CATCH THIS. IT'S FROZEN OVER.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S A CHALLENGE RIGHT
THERE. FIGHT THE ELEMENTS, SIT THERE.
&gt;&gt; USE THESE TINY FISHING POLES.
&gt;&gt; MY DAUGHTER HAD ONE LIKE THAT.
SHE CAUGHT HERSELF A BIG FISH.
&gt;&gt; DUDE PULLS A FISH OUT OF HIS ICE HOLE THERE.
THERE ARE REGULATIONS AND RULES
YOU NEED TO FOLLOW WHEN YOU'RE FISHING, SO HE PICKS UP HIS
STANDARD MEASURING TOOL HERE AND
LOOKS LIKE THE FISH DOESN'T QUITE MEASURE UP, SO IT'S TIME
TO CATCH AND RELEASE.
BUT HE RELEASES TWO. &gt;&gt; OH!
&gt;&gt; THAT WASN'T A FISH, THAT WAS
HIS PHONE! &gt;&gt; AN iPHONE 5S WENT FOR A SWIM
ALONG WITH THE FISH.
HERE'S THE MOTION, LOOKS LIKE THE PHONE IS IN SOME SORT OF
WEATHER RESISTANT CASE, BUT IT
CERTAINLY WASN'T BUOYANT. THERE GOES THE FISH.
&gt;&gt; NO!
&gt;&gt; LIKE HE REALIZED IT TOO LATE. &gt;&gt; YEP.
&gt;&gt; THIS STORY IS ALL ABOUT ONE
LADY, ONE CAMERA, ONE MOTORCYCLE, BUT 9,000 MILES
THROUGH THE U.S. FOR CHANGE.
&gt;&gt; AS SOMEONE WHO'S PHOTOGRAPHED WOMEN, I HAVE SEEN BEAUTY,
RESILIENCE, AND HEARTBREAK AND
HAVE BEEN TOUCHED BY THE CHALLENGES WE ALL FACE.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS LAUREN AND SHE
PHOTOGRAPHS WOMEN, BUT SHE DECIDED TO TAKE HER TALENTS ON
THE ROAD ON A MOTORCYCLE FOR A
VERY SPECIAL CAUSE, TO CREATE AWARENESS AND RAISE FUNDS TO
HELP VICTIMS, SURVIVORS OF SEX
TRAFFICKING. &gt;&gt; WE ALL NEED SUPPORT IN THE
CHALLENGING TIMES OF OUR LIVES.
THAT'S WHY I'VE PARTNERED WITH THE ORGANIZATION THAT SUPPORTS
AND MENTORS SEX TRAFFICKING.
&gt;&gt; THE FOUNDER OF THE INITIATIVE IS HERSELF A SURVIVOR OF SEX
TRAFFICKING, SO TOGETHER THEY
WANT TO HELP SURVIVORS GET BACK INTO SOCIETY, SO THE FUNDS THAT
THEY ARE RAISING ARE GOING TO
HELP 50 SURVIVORS THROUGH A PROGRAM THAT THEY HAVE CALLED
THE ELEVATE PROGRAM.
LAUREN DROVE THE MOTORCYCLE BY OUR STUDIOS AND WE ASKED HER TO
JOIN US TO TELL US MORE ABOUT
WHAT SHE'S DOING. &gt;&gt; WELCOME, LAUREN.
&gt;&gt; TELL US MORE ABOUT THIS
JOURNEY AND WHAT IT'S BEEN LIKE FOR YOU TO TRAVEL SO MANY
THOUSANDS OF MILES.
&gt;&gt; YEAH, I'VE RIDDEN ABOUT 8,600 MILES, I BELIEVE, IN ABOUT SIX
WEEKS.
I'VE DONE 40 SURVIVOR PORTRAITS AND RAISED $40,000 AS OF THIS
MORNING.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S HUGE, PEOPLE ARE REALLY COMING TOGETHER TO
SUPPORT YOUR CAUSE.
WHAT'S YOUR END GOAL?  &gt;&gt; WHAT IS IT ABOUT THE
SURVIVORS HAVE SAID WHAT WAS THE
KEY FOR THEM GETTING OUT OF THAT LIFE?
&gt;&gt; THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT
STORIES. SOME OF THE SURVIVORS WERE
TRAFFICKED AS CHILDREN BY FAMILY
MEMBERS. I WOULD SAY THE ONE THING THEY
HAVE IN COMMON IS THEY WERE
VULNERABLE AT ONE POINT IN THEIR LIFE AND THEY WERE TAKEN
ADVANTAGE OF.
THE BIG PART OF THE PROJECT IS PHOTOGRAPHING SURVIVORS SO I CAN
SHOW THE REST OF AMERICA THIS IS
WHAT A SURVIVOR LOOKS LIKE, JUST LIKE YOU AND I.
YOU MAY SEE HER AT THE GROCERY
STORE, HER KIDS MAYBE GO TO SCHOOL WITH YOUR KIDS AND YOU
NEVER IMAGINE WHAT SHE'S BEEN
THROUGH. &gt;&gt; WHAT PROMOTES YOUR MESSAGE
MORE, CAMERA OR THE MOTORCYCLE?
&gt;&gt; I WOULD SAY THE MOTORCYCLE. IT GETS A LOT OF ATTENTION,
ESPECIALLY BEING A GIRL ON A
BIKE, IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU NORMALLY SEE.
&gt;&gt; IF YOU WANT TO HELP LAUREN
OUT IN HER JOURNEY, HEAD OVER TO RIGHTTHISMINUTE.COM AND LOOK FOR
THE LINK OR ALSO FIND IT ON OUR

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; IT DOES THE JOB, STRUGGLED
ITS WAY UP THE HILL, ENGINE
SCREAMING. &gt;&gt; IMPRESSIVE.
&gt;&gt; HOW COULD YOU NOT THINK I'LL
HAVE A GO? &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW, I'M GOING TO
BELIEVE THIS IS THE LITTLE
MACHINE THAT WILL. &gt;&gt; ALL YOU CAN DO IS DRIVE
STRAIGHT AND DEFINITELY DON'T
TURN TO THE SIDE. WATCH FOR THE DRIVER.
&gt;&gt; YOU CAN SEE QUICKLY JUMPS OUT
OF THE WAY. EVENTUALLY COMES TO A STOP IN
PIECES.
&gt;&gt; YOU WERE RIGHT, LITTLE TREASURE THAT WILL ROLL OVER.
&gt;&gt; I DON'T SPEAK RUSSIAN, BUT I
THINK WHAT THEY ARE SAYING HERE IS NAILED IT.
&gt;&gt; WE HEAD TO CHINA FOR THE NEXT
ONE, HAPPENS REALLY QUICKLY. YOU CAN SEE IT.
THIS CAR CHANGES ITS MIND.
&gt;&gt; OH, WOW. &gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY ENORMOUS IMPACT.
IT'S AN EMPTY HIGHWAY, BUT THIS
DRIVER SUDDENLY REALIZES AT THE LAST SECOND THAT'S MY EXIT.
TURNS HARD, NOT HARD ENOUGH,
SLAMS STRAIGHT INTO THOSE THINGS RIGHT THERE.
HAD A BIG DEAL IN SAVING THE
LIVES OF EVERYBODY INSIDE. IN FACT, THEY ARE CREDITING THE
PEOPLE INSIDE THE CAR WERE
WEARING THEIR SEAT BELTS AND AS SUCH, MINOR INJURIES.
&gt;&gt; WHAT A DUMMY.
YOU HAVE THE LIVES OF OTHER PEOPLE IN YOUR HANDS.
DON'T PULL THOSE MOVES.
&gt;&gt; LISTEN UP, BECAUSE IF YOU NEED SOME LAST MINUTE HALLOWEEN
IDEAS, I HAVE TWO YOU CAN USE
AND THEY ARE SUPER COOL. THE FIRST ONE --
&gt;&gt; WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
&gt;&gt; PRINCESS. &gt;&gt; OH, PRINCESS?
&gt;&gt; GIANT THUNDERSTORM.
ISN'T IT ADORABLE? SHE AND HER DAD REALLY LOVE
COMING UP WITH REALLY COOL
HALLOWEEN COSTUMES, AND THIS YEAR SHE DID THIS.
ONE OF THE BLOWOUT COSTUMES,
LINED IT WITH COTTON AND INSIDE IS A STRING OF L.E.D. LIGHTS,
AND HER LITTLE CROWN IS ALSO
LIT. &gt;&gt; SHE'LL BE TAKING THE
NEIGHBORHOOD BY STORM.
&gt;&gt; THIS NEXT ONE IS REALLY COOL. IF YOU --
&gt;&gt; HAPPEN TO BE A HOLLYWOOD
MAKEUP ARTIST. &gt;&gt; HER FACE IS BEAT.
&gt;&gt; SHE WENT CATTY IN THIS VIDEO
WITH THIS PRETTY CLEVER IDEA. LAST MINUTE MAKEUP IDEA, WHICH I
THINK ANYBODY COULD DO.
IT DOESN'T REALLY SEEM THAT HARD.
&gt;&gt; I THINK OLI AND I COULD
EASILY THROW THIS TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; USES EYE LINER TO MAKE HER
EYEBROWS LOOK MORE FREE.
&gt;&gt; MORE LIKE MINE. &gt;&gt; YEAH.
SHE USES BLACK EYE SHADOW TO
DARKEN THE CONTOUR OF HER FACE AROUND HER EYES.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS THE COMPLETE MAKEUP
GUY. &gt;&gt; THE WHISKERS ARE BASICALLY
BLACK LINES HIGHLIGHTED WITH A
WHITE LINER AND PUT SOME MATTE LIP GLOSS ON.
QUITE FRANKLY, I THINK IT WAS
COOL. DID HAVE COOL CAT CONTACTS, PUT
THOSE ON AND VOILA.
&gt;&gt; TURN UP WHENEVER YOU WANT.</description>

      <description>WAGER WHO'S GOING TO WIN, $100.
WELL, $100 ON THE LINE HERE, BUT
THE GUYS IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT ISN'T RACING AGAINST ANYBODY
ELSE.
$100 IS GOING RIGHT THERE IN THE PASSENGER SEAT.
LINDSEY'S BEING PASSED WITH $100
WHEN I ACCELERATE. IF YOU CAN GRAB IT, IT'S YOURS.
&gt;&gt; EASY.
&gt;&gt; I SEE SOMETHING IN THE CENTER OF THE SCREEN.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS A LAMBORGHINI.
VERY FAST CAR AND IT ACCELERATES WITH LOTS AND LOTS OF PRESSURE.
&gt;&gt; SO SHE CAN ONLY REACH FOR THE
DOLLAR BILL AS HE'S ACCELERATING.
&gt;&gt; EXACTLY.
&gt;&gt; DUDE HERE IS PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE AN EASY
BET FOR HIM TO WIN.
&gt;&gt; GRAB THE SEAT AND AS SOON AS HE GOES, RIGHT THERE, CAN'T PUSH
BACK.
&gt;&gt; YEAH, I WANT TO SAY GET YOUR MONEY, GIRL.
&gt;&gt; LOVELY LINDSEY, LET'S SEE HOW
YOU DO. ROLLING START, WHEN HE GETS ON
THE THROTTLE, GAME ON.
&gt;&gt; BUT I THINK HE KNEW THE DECK WAS STACKED AGAINST HER, BECAUSE
HER SEAT BELT IS LOCKED.
SHE'S LIKE, COME ON, I CAN'T EVEN.
IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK.
I'M NOT GOING TO GET THE $100. WAIT!
HER SEAT BELT UNLOCKED.
SEE THE LOOK ON HIS FACE.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; NOW :50 AND SHIRI HAS BEEN
TELLING US COLDEST DAY WE HAVE
HAD CERTAINLY THIS FALL. SINCE IT HAS BEEN A WHILE.
&gt;&gt; Sara:  SANTA ROSA JUST SAY
IN BED, EVERYBODY. &gt;&gt; Shiri:  SAY IN BED.
TAKING SOMETHING WARM WITH YOU.
NOW DOWN 37 DEGREES. UNTIL NOW THE COLDEST THAT WE
HAD WAS 42.
WITH THAT 37 COMES CLEAR SKIES, A LITTLE BIT OF A BREEZE.
MAKES IT FEEL LIKE 28.
WIND CHILLS OUT THERE AS WELL THIS MORNING.
YOUR 8 A.M. TEMPERATURE STILL
IN THE 30s. BY 10 A.M., LOWER 40s IN
BOSTON.
HIGHS ONLY IN THE UPPER 40s. THAT MEANS WE ARE FALLING ABOUT
10 DEGREES BELOW AVERAGE THIS
TIME OF THE YEAR. SAME THING GOES FOR LAWYER
REIGNS, BEVERLY, PORTSMOUTH,
NEW HAMPSHIRE. 48  IN FITCHBURG.
42 IN WORCESTER TODAY AND UPPER
40s DOWN ACROSS SOUTHEASTERN MASS.
MAYBE A CUP OF POPS OF LOWER
50s. IF YOU GET LUCKY, HEAVY RAIN
WILL TURN INTO THE BIG STORY
HERE TOMORROW. THERE IS THE POTENTIAL A LITTLE
BIT OF INLAND MIXING OR INLAND
ICE HERE AT ONSET. WE ARE TALKING CENTRAL
MASSACHUSETTS, MERRIMACK
VALLEY. SPOTS TO WATCH FOR THAT.
THE RISK IS SLOW AND WE HAVE
MOUNTAIN SNOW THAT I AM GOING TO BE TRACKING.
FUTURECAST TOMORROW MORNING AND
A LITTLE DRIZZLE FROM THE SOUTH SHORE DOWN TO THE CAPE AND
ISLANDS.
ANY OF THAT ON SHORE FOR THE NORTH SHORE, COULD START AS A
LITTLE BIT OF A TEMPERATURE IN.
GETTING INTO THE AFTERNOON WHEN THE MAIN RAIN MOVES IN.
INITIALLY A LITTLE BIT OF
MIXING NOT WITH ANY STICKING IN THE WORCESTER AREA AND EVEN A
LITTLE BIT OF SLEET WORKING ITS
WAY IN TO LOWELL AND DERRY AS WELL, BUT THINGS WARM UP ENOUGH
SO THE BULK OF PLAIN RAIN.
OVERNIGHT IT IS HEAVY AT TIMES INTO THE FRIDAY MORNING
COMMUTE.
AFTER THAT IT WILL TURN BREEZY BUT DRY OUT.
SNOW CHANCES REALLY ANY
ACCUMULATION IS GOING TO BE LIMITED TO THE B SHIRES AND THE
MOUNTAINS WITHIN NEW ENGLAND.
LOCALLY IT IS GOING TO BE PRIMARILY RAIN THAT WE ARE
WATCHING HERE TOMORROW.
UPPER 40s TODAY AND TOMORROW. 55 DEGREES ON FRIDAY.
WE WILL DRY UP, BUT LIKE I
SAID, IT IS GOING TO GET GUSTY. 30 TO 40-MILE-PER-HOUR GUSTS
EXPECTED ON FRIDAY.
SATURDAY COMES ALONG, STILL MOSTLY CLOUDY WITH AFTERNOON
SHOWERS AT 58 DEGREES.
AND THE SLIGHT RISK FOR A LINGERING SHOWER INTO YOUR
SUNDAY.
LET'S SEND YOU OVER TO. &gt;&gt; Julie:  WITH LIVE DRIVE-TIME
TRAFFIC.
CHECKING TRAFFIC AND WEATHER TOGETHER EVERY TEN MINUTES.
&gt;&gt; Julie:  AN UPDATE ON THIS
ACCIDENT ON 128 NORTHBOUND RIGHT OFF THE SHOULDER BEFORE
24.
WE SHOWED YOU THAT IN THE LIVE PICTURES FROM SKYFOX.
JUST ABOUT CLEARED OUT AND
THOSE DELAYS ARE STARTING TO LOOSEN UP AND NOW THE VOLUME IS
CON ESSENTIAL TRAIPTED AS YOU
APPROACH 139. PIKE LOOKS FINE FROM FRAMINGHAM
THROUGH NATICK.
SMART OF THE PIKE SLOWING DOWN THROUGH THE MEDFORD AREA.
ROUTE 1 IN SAUGUS STARTING TO
PICK UP VOLUME. 28 MINUTES ON THE YOU
EXPRESSWAY.
24 MINUTES ON 24 BECAUSE OF THAT ACCIDENT.
33 MINUTES ON PIKE EASTBOUND

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; BACK HERE AT 6:14.
DETECTIVES ARE LOOKING AT
MEDICAL AND MECHANICAL CLUES NOW INTO THE INVESTIGATION INTO
A WRONG-WAY CRASH THAT KILLED
FIVE PEOPLE. THE NEW INFORMATION ABOUT THE
INVESTIGATION IS EMERGING AS
FAMILY AND FRIENDS OF THE DRIVER WHO ALLEGEDLY CAUSED THE
CRASH ARE GIVING INTIMATE
DETAILS ABOUT HER LIFE. SAYING HER ONLY GOAL WAS TO
HELP PEOPLE.
FOX25'S DANIEL MILLER JOINS US NOW.
A LOT ABOUT THIS TRAGIC CRASH
STILL REMAINS A MYSTERY. &gt;&gt; Daniel:  YES IT DOES, GENE.
STATE POLICE ARE FOCUSING ON
THE WOMAN THAT DROVE THE WONG WAY.
POLICE HAVE IDENTIFIED HER AS
31-YEAR-OLD VALANTEIN B URSON DRIVING ON THE WRONG SAID OF
THE HIGHWAY WHEN SHE HIT A CAR
WITH FOUR COLLEGE STUDENTS INSIDE.
BURSON AND ALL FOUR OF THOSE
COLLEGE STUDENTS WERE KILLED. STATE POLICE ARE CONDUCTING
TOXICOLOGY TESTS TO DETERMINE
IF DRUGS OR ALCOHOL PLAYED A ROLE.
THEY ARE ALSO LOOKING TO SEE IF
EITHER VEHICLES HAD A BLACK BOX RECORDING OF WHAT HAPPENED IN
THE MOMENTS BEFORE THE CRASH.
STATE POLICE TOLD THE "BOSTON GLOBE" EVEN IF EITHER VEHICLE
HAD HOSE RECORDING DEVICES,
THEY MAY HAVE BEEN DESTROYED. WE PULLED THE DRIVING RECORD OF
THE WRONG-WAY DRIVER VALANTEIN
BURSON. BETWEEN 2004 AND 2015 FIVE
SPEEDING TICKETS SPLIT BETWEEN
MASSACHUSETTS AND RHODE ISLAND. HER DRIVER'S LICENSE WAS JUST
REINSTATED THIS PAST JANUARY,
AND FAMILY MEMBERS ARE SPEAKING OUT ABOUT THAT WRONG-WAY
DRIVER.
HER MOTHER TOLD "THE GLOBE" SHE JUST LANDED HER DREAM JOB
WORKING WITH PRISONERS AT THE
MASSACHUSETTS TREATMENT CENTER IN BRIDGEWATER.
THAT FACILITY HOUSES SEX OFFEND
TERES AND INMATES. AFTER BEING DECLARED SEXUALLY
DANGEROUS.
SHE WAS GOING BACK TO SCHOOL TO GET OFFICER DOOR FOR RAT.
HER BOYFRIEND SAID SHE HAD
ATTENDED TO -- PLANNED TO ATTEND A PARTY BUT DID NOT KNOW
WHERE SHE WAS HEADED WHEN THE
CRASH HAPPENED. THE OUTPOURING OF SUPPORT FOR
THE FOUR COLLEGE STUDENTS
KILLED IN THE CRASH. WE HAVE PICTURES OF THREE OF
THEM HERE.
A VIGIL AT HYANNIS VILLAGE GREEN.
THIS CASE HAS GOVERNMENT'S
ATTENTION. &gt;&gt; Gene:  THE DEADLY CRASH THIS
MIDDLEBOROUGH THE FOURTH
WRONG-WAY CRASH WE REPORTED ON. WE TALKED TO GOVERNOR CHARLIE
BAKER TO SEE IF SOMETHING THAT
CAN BE DONE TO PREVENT -- CLAIMS NO ONE -- THAT IT IS
JUST A TRAGIC ACCIDENT AND SAYS
HE HAS TALKED TO TRANSPORTATION OFFICIALS ABOUT ON-AND-OFF
RAMPS IN THE STATE.
&gt;&gt; TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT ELSE WE CAN DO WITH RESPECT TO SIGNAGE
TO DEAL WITH THIS SORT OF THING
SO THAT PEOPLE DON'T GET ON THE WRONG ROAD GOING IN THE WRONG
DIRECTION TO GET SOME OF THOSE
-- SOME OF THOSE -- CAN GET CONFUSING AND THIS WOMAN GOT
CONFUSED AT THIS ONE.

      <description>GENE AND SARA, BACK TO YOU.
&gt;&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, IF YOU HAVE YOUR
PJs ON RIGHT NOW AT 6:17 THIS MORNING AS YOU ARE GETTING
READY FOR WORK OR SCHOOL, YOU
MIGHT WANT TO KEEP THEM ON. &gt;&gt; IS TODAY WEAR YOUR PJS TO
WORK DAY.
&gt;&gt; I GOT THAT MEMO. &gt;&gt; ALWAYS LAST TO KNOW.
I SLEPT IN THIS SO AT LEAST I
DON'T FEEL OUT OF PLACE. &gt;&gt; IT IS OCTOBER AND THOSE ARE
WHERE THE PJs FEELING AMAZING.
GOING FROM COLD TO WET AND A LITTLE BIT WARMER INTO TOMORROW
AFTERNOON.
LOOK AT THESE RAIN TOTALS EXPECTED.
HEAVY RAIN UP TO AN INCH OF
RAIN THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY. THAT WAS COMING DOWN THE LINE
FOR TODAY.
WE ARE GETTING THROUGH CLEAR, COLD CONDITIONS THIS MORNING
STARTING AT 33 IN PLYMOUTH.
37 IN BOSTON. 39  IN WORCESTER, AND 35 IN
LOWELL -- LAWRENCE, EXCUSE ME.
WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF WIND THAT IS MAKING IT FEEL 5 TO 10
DEGREES COOLER DEPENDING ON HOW
STRONG THE WINDS ARE IN YOUR TOWN.
PULL OUT THE FOX25 WEATHER APP.
YOU GOT YOUR TEMPERATURE RIGHT THERE.
YOU KNOW HOW THIS DRESS.
8 A.M., 36  DEGREES. BY 10 A.M. FINALLY UP TO ABOUT
40 AND THATS A WHERE HE
TEMPERATURES ARE KEPT IN THE UPPER 40s AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON.
YES, MORE SCATTERED CLOUDS THAT
WILL FORM LIKE YESTERDAY INTO THE AFTERNOON AND AFFECTS SOME
ELEMENTS OF CLOUD COVER.
UPPER 40s BOSTON, IPSWICH IN LAWRENCE.
WORCESTER MY COOL POT.
49 IN HIGH AN IS AND UP A CANCEL OF 50s IN NEW BEDFORD
DOWN TO THE VIN GRAD.
FUTURE CAST. AND NOTICE TOMORROW MORNING,
ANOTHER COLD START.
A LOT OF FREEZING TEMPERATURES OUT THERE.
8 A.M., WE WILL BE WATCHING THE
COASTLINE FOR A LITTLE DRIZZLE. IT WILL BE DRIZZLE FOR THE
SOUTH HIS OR HER AND THE CAPE
AND IF WE GET ANYTHING ON THE NORTH SHORE INITIALLY EARLY
TOMORROW MORNING, IT COULD BE A
TEMPERATURE IN OR TWO. NOW AS WE INCH INTO THE
AFTERNOON, WE START OUT MOSTLY
DRY HERE. TEMPERATURES COULD BE A LITTLE
SLOWER THAN THIS TO ACTUALLY
WARM UP WHICH MEANS I AM GOING TO BE WATCHING SPOTS LIKE THE
MERRIMACK VALLEY INTO THE
NORTHERN WORCESTER HILLS AND SOUTHERN NEW HAMPSHIRE.
IF WE DO GET ANY DRIZZLE AND
THEY ARE TOO EARLY IN THE MORNING COULD SEE A LITTLE
PATCHY ICE AND DURING THE
AFTERNOON WHEN WE ARE SAFELY IN THE 40s, THE SNOW STAYS OVER
THE BERKSHIRES HERE.
HEAVY RAIN OVERNIGHT INTO YOUR FRIDAY MORNING.
AND THOSE FRIDAY RAIN SHOWERS
END BETWEEN 8 AND 11 A.M. THERE YOU GO.
IT SNOW TOTALS WILL STAY OVER
THE MOUNTAINS TOMORROW. WE COULD JUST SEE A LITTLE BIT
OF SLEET MIXED IN OUT TOWARD
THE WORCESTER HILLS. SEVEN-DAY FORECAST AND THE
WEEKEND FALLS VIEW HAVE THE
WEEKEND IN THE MID- TO UPPER 50s.
A SLIGHT RISK OF SOME SATURDAY
AFTERNOON SHOWERS AND EVEN SMALLER RISK ON SUN AND LOOKS
LIKE NICE AND BRIGHT ON MONDAY
WITH HIGHS IN THE UPPER 50s. BACK TO YOU.
&gt;&gt; Gene:  DID YOU SAY SNOW
TOTALS.</description>

AVERAGE OF 25% NEXT YEAR.

AMERICANS.
&gt;&gt; AMERICANS ARE GOING TO EXPERIENCE ANOTHER MASSIVE
DOUBLE-DIGIT HIKE.

IT IS GOING TO BE 60, 70, 80,
90%. &gt;&gt; Sara:  LATER IT WAS REVEALED
THAT 99% OF TRUMP'S EMPLOYEES
HAVE PRIVATE INSURANCE AND NOT OBAMA.

HILLARY CLINTON LAID OUT HER PLANS TO CHANGE OBAMA CARE.WE
ARE GOING TO REALLY TACKLE
THAT. WE WILL GET CO-PAYS AND
PREMIUMS AND DEDUCTIBLES AND
TACKLE PRESCRIPTION COSTS AND WE CAN DO THAT WITHOUT RIPPING
AWAY THE INSURANCE THAT PEOPLE
NOW HAVE. &gt;&gt; Sara:  CLINTON HELD HER
RALLY ACROSS THE STREET FROM AN
EARLY VOTING. SHE IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE THE
STRATEGY IN OTHER BATTLE GROUND

      <description>MASS PIKE BACK IN MARCH.
&gt;&gt;&gt; WE ARE HEARING FROM THE
OWNER OF A DRAINAGE COMPANY THAT EMPLOYED TWO MEN WHO DIED

VIOLATIONS FOR ATLANTIC DRAIN SERVICE.
FOX25 FOUND THAT THE COMPANY
OWNS TENS OF THOUSANDS IN FINES FROM OSHA WHICH STILL HAVE NOT
BEEN PAID.
THE COMPANY IS ONE OSHA'S SEVERE VIOLATORS.
ONE OF AT LEAST 12 IN THE
STATE. WE TRIED ASKING THE OWNER ABOUT
THE SAFETY RECORD, BUT ATLANTIC
DRAIN'S OWNER KEVIN OTTO WOULD ONLY SAY THIS, ALL OF US AT
ATLANTIC DRAIN COMPANY ARE
SADDENED AND SHOCKED BY THE EVENTS THAT CLAIMED THE LIVES
OF TWO FRIENDS AND EMPLOYEES.
THEY WENT ON TO SAY THAT THEY TAKE GREAT PRIDE ENSURING THAT
EMPLOYEES ARE OPERATING UNDER
PROPERLY SUPERVISED AND SAFE WORK SITES.
KELVIN MADDOX OF BROCKTON AND

      <description>OF EXPECTED RAIN.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 23 YEARS AGO ONE DIE-HARD
CUBS FAN MADE A BIG PREDICTION THAT HE HOPES COMES THROUGH.
MICHAEL LEE WAS STRUGGLING WHAT
TO PUT IN HIS HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOK.
HE DIDN'T WANT A QUOTE FROM A
FAVORITE AUTHOR OR AND THOUGHT BACK TO A DREAM HE HAD AS A
YOUNG CHILD THAT STUCK WITH HIM
FOR YEARS &gt;&gt; THE RED SCOREBOARD WITH
HARRY CAREY BLASTING AWAY WITH
THE WORLD SERIES. IT WAS PRETTY VIVID AND I
REMEMBERED IT ALL THROUGHOUT
HIGH SCHOOL AND NOW I AM GETTING REMINDED AGAIN.
&gt;&gt; Gene:  GET THIS, HE WROTE IN
THAT YEAR BOOK CUBS WIN THE WORLD SERIES IN 2016.
YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST.
HOW ABOUT THIS. DOES HE HAVE LOTTERY NUMBERS
FOR ME.
IF THE CUBBYS ARE GOING TO MAKE A DREAM COME TRUE THEY NEED A
COMEBACK AND HAVE THOSE BATS
GOING AFTER BEING SHUT OUT LAST NIGHT.
THAT IS PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.
IF THAT COMES TRUE, THAT MAN IS GOING TO BE IN DEMAND.
&gt;&gt; YES, HE IS.
WHAT PREDICTIONS DO WE WANT TO MAKE FOR HOW MANY YEARS OUT?
LET'S THINK ABOUT IT.
GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE. I PREDICT THINGS WILL SLOW DOWN
LATER THIS MORNING ON THE
ROADS.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; BACK AT 5:14 THIS MORNING.
DETECTIVES ARE LOOKING FOR
MEDICAL AND MECHANICAL CLUES NOW IN THE INVESTIGATION INTO A
WRONG-WAY CRASH THAT KILLED
FIVE PEOPLE. NEW INFORMATION ABOUT THE
INVESTIGATION IS EMERGING AS
FAMILY AND FRIENDS OF THE DRIVER WHO ALLEGEDLY CAUSED THE
CRASH ARE REVEALING INTIMATE
DETAILS ABOUT HER LIFE SAYING HER ONLY GOAL WAS TO HELP
PEOPLE.
FOX25'S DANIEL MILLER JOINS US NOW.
DANIEL, A LOT ABOUT THIS TRAGIC
CRASH STILL REMAINS A MYSTERY. &gt;&gt; Daniel:  YES IT DOES, GENE.
STATE POLICE ARE FOCUSING ON
THIS WOMAN DRIVING THE WRONG WAY ON 495.
STATE POLICE IDENTIFIED HER AS
31-YEAR-OLD VALANTEIN BURSON DRIVING SOUTH ON THE NORTHBOUND
SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY WHEN SHE
HIT A CAR WITH FOUR COLLEGE STUDENTS INSIDE.
BURSON AND ALL FOUR OF THOSE
COLLEGE STUDENTS WERE KILLED. STATE POLICE SAY THEY ARE
CONDUCTING TOXICOLOGY TESTS TO
DETERMINE WHETHER DRUGS OR ALCOHOL PLAYED A ROLE.
THEY ARE ALSO LOOKING TO SEE IF
EITHER VEHICLE HAD A BLACK BOX RECORDING WHAT HAPPENED IN THE
MOMENTS BEFORE THE CRASH.
STATE POLICE TOLD THE "BOSTON GLOBE" IF EITHER VEHICLE HAD
THOSE RECORDING DEVICES THIS HE
MAY HAVE BEEN DESTROYED. SO WE PULLED THE DRIVING RECORD
OF THE WRONG-WAY DRIVER
VALANTEIN BURSON BETWEEN 2004 AND 2015, FIVE SPEEDING TICKETS
SPLIT BETWEEN MASSACHUSETTS AND
RHODE ISLAND. HER DRIVER LICENSE WAS JUST
REINSTATE THIS PAST JANUARY,
AND FAMILY MEMBERS ARE SPEAKING OUT ABOUT THAT WRONG-WAY
DRIVER.
HER MOTHER TOLD "THE GLOBE" SHE JUST LANDED HER DREAM JOB
WORKING WITH PRISONER AT THE
MASSACHUSETTS TREATMENT CENTER IN BRIDGEWATER.
THAT FACILITY HOUSES SEX
OFFENDERS AND INMATES CIVILLY COMMITTED AFTER BEING DECLARED
SEXUALLY DANGEROUS.
HER MOM SAID SHE WAS PLANNING TO GO BACK TO COLLEGE TO GET
HER DOCTORATE DEGREE IN
CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY. AS FOR THAT NIGHT, HER
BOYFRIEND SAID SHE HAD PLANNED
TO ATTEND A PARTY SUNDAY NIGHT BUT DID NOT KNOW WHERE SHE WAS
HEADED WHEN THE CRASH HAPPENED.
THE OUTPOURING OF SUPPORT CONTINUES TODAY FOR THE FOUR
COLLEGE STUDENT KILLED IN THE
CRASH. A VIGIL WILL BE HELD TONIGHT IN
HYANNIS AT VILLAGE GREEN AT
5:30, AND, GENE, THIS CASE ALSO HAS THE GOVERNOR'S ATTENTION.
&gt;&gt; Gene:  YOU ARE RIGHT,
DANIEL, IT DOES. THE DEADLY CRASH IN
MIDDLEBOROUGH IS THE FOURTH
WRONG-WAY CRASH WE REPORTED ON IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS.
WE TALKED TO GOVERNOR CHARLIE
BAKER TO SEE IF SOMETHING CAN BE DONE TO IMPROVE SAFETY AND
PREVENT THESE TYPE OF CRASHES.
GOVERNOR BAKER BLAMES NO ONE AND THIS IS JUST AN AWFUL
TRAGEDY AND GOES CONTINUE TO
ADMIT THAT THE ON-AND-OFF RAMPS IN MASSACHUSETTS HIGHWAYS CAN
BE HARD TO NAVIGATE. [INAUDIBLE]
WELL,  THE GOVERNOR WANTED TO
SAY THAT THE STAFF IS NOW TAKING A LOOK AT WHAT THE STATE
CAN DO ABOUT THE SIGNS AND TRY
PREVENT SIMILAR CRASHES.</description>

TEMPERATURES WILL BE FREEZING
WHEN YOU WAKE UP TOMORROW. TEMPERATURES SLOWLY WARMING UP
BY 10 A.M.
MOST OF US OUT OF THE WOODS AS FAR AS THE FREEZING
TEMPERATURES GO.

VALLEY.
THE COOLER AIR SEEMS TO GET TRAPPED THERE AND 2 P.M. THE
STEADIER STUFF ARE MOVING IN.
WE HAVE TO KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON TEMPERATURES SOUTHERN NEW
HAMPSHIRE AND FITCHBURG AND
WORCESTER. I JUST -- I WORRY IN THESE
SITUATIONS BECAUSE HE SEEN
TEMPERATURES FALL KIND OF FLAT AND STAY A LITTLE TOO COLD A
LITTLE TOO LONG BEFORE, BUT BY
6 P.M., ALL RAIN IN WHERE WE ARE GETTING THE HEAVIEST STUFF
TOMORROW.
IT IS RAIN THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY MORNING.
11 P.M., YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE
POCKETS OF HEAVY RAIN OUT THERE.

MORNING'S COMMUTE LOOK LIKE. IT IS GOING TO BE AN ABSOLUTE
SOAKER.

SOUTHERN NEW HAMPSHIRE FOR A
LITTLE ICING CONCERNS AND TOO SLOW TO WARM UP.

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL
NOMINEE DONALD TRUMP IS
SLIPPING IN THE POLLS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE,  BUT LOOKING TO TURN
IT AROUND WITH ANOTHER VISIT TO
THE STATE. TRUMP WILL BE IN MANCHESTER
FRIDAY AFTERNOON.
IT IS HIS 8th TRIP TO NEW HAMPSHIRE SINCE JUNE.
DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE HILLARY
CLINTON JUST WRAPPED UP HER THIRD VISIT TO THE STATE WITH
MASSACHUSETTS SENATOR ELIZABETH
WARREN. YESTERDAY THE CANDIDATES SPENT
TIME IN THE BATTLEGROUND STATE
OF FLORIDA AND THEY BOTH TALKED ABOUT THE BIG POLITICAL STORY
OF THE WEEK.
OBAMACARE PREMIUMS GOING UP AN AVERAGE OF 25%.
TRUMP ATTACKED OBAMACARE AND
BROUGHT SOME OF HIS HOTEL EMPLOYEES UP ON STAGE WITH HIM
TO EMPHASIZE HOW THE PRICE
INCREASE WILL AFFECT WORKING AMERICANS.
&gt;&gt; AMERICANS ARE GOING TO
EXPERIENCE ANOTHER MASSIVE DOUBLE-DIGIT HIKE.
THEY SAID 25%.
FORGET -- YOU WILL PAY 25%. IT IS GOING TO BE 60, 70, 80,
90%.
&gt;&gt; LATER IT WAS REVEALED THAT 99% OF TRUMP'S HOTEL EMPLOYEES
HAVE PRIVATE INSURANCE AND DO
NOT EVEN HAVE OBAMACARE. HILLARY CLINTON WAS INTERVIEWED
BY A FLORIDA RADIO STATION
WHERE SHE LAID OUT HER PLANS TO CHANGE OBAMACARE.
&gt;&gt; WE ARE GOING TO REALLY
TACKLE THAT. WE ARE GOING TO GET CO-PAYS AND
PREMIUMS AND DEDUCTIBLES DOWN.
WE ARE GOING TO TACKLE PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS, AND WE
CAN DO THAT WITHOUT RIPPING
AWAY THE INSURANCE THAT PEOPLE NOW HAVE.
&gt;&gt; Sara:  CLINTON HELD HER
CAMPAIGN RALLY IN FLORIDA RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET FROM AN EARLY
VOTING LOCATION.
DURING HER SPEECH SHE POINTED TO THE POLLING PLACE AND URGED
PEOPLE TO CAST THEIR EARLY
VOTES.</description>

AS FOR THE CAUSE OF THIS CRASH, THAT STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION.
WE KNOW THIS HAPPENED AROUND

THE BUS.
32 STUDENT PLUS THE DRIVER. THE BUS WAS TAKING THE KIDS
HOME FROM THE CHARLES BERZANI
SCHOOL WHEN IT HIT A HYDRANT AND UTILITY POLE PULLING INTO

KITER STREET. A STUDENT DESCRIBED WHAT IT WAS
LIKE.
&gt;&gt; IT WAS GOING FAST AND BUMPY AND WE HEARD SOMETHING CRACK

FIRE AND WE JUST RAN, LIKE, SCREAMING EVERYWHERE.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: SEVEN PEOPLE WERE
TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL WITH NONLIFE-THREATENING INJURIES.
THEY WERE TREATED AND RELEASED.
NO ONE WAS HOME AT THE TIME OF THAT CRASH.
THAT IS A BIT OF GOOD NEWS.
AND KIDS DID SAY RECENTLY THEY HAD A BUS EVACUATION DRILL AND
THEY KNEW EXACTLY WHAT TO
HAPPEN WHEN -- WHAT TO DO WHEN THAT HAPPENED.
AND SCHOOL OFFICIALS WILL BE ON
SCENE TO REASSURE KIDS THAT THEY ARE SAFE AND I HAVE AN

SUPERINTENDENT TRYING TO FIND OUT THE LATEST ON THE
INVESTIGATION OF THE CRASH.

&gt;&gt; THE OWNER OF THE COMPANY

FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE TRAGEDY.
WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON
TRACKING HIM DOWN EVER SINCE WE UNCOVERED A LONG LIST OF SAFETY
VIOLATIONS FOR ATLANTIC DRAIN
SERVICE. FOX25'S ROBERT GOULSTON WENT TO
ROSLINDALE WHERE HE SPOKE TO A
LIFE-LONG FRIEND OF ONE OF THE WORKERS KILLED.
&gt;&gt; JUST TRAGIC WHAT HAPPENED.
VERY SAD. BECAUSE HE REALLY WAS AN
INCREDIBLE GUY.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: LIFE-LONG FRIEND OF WORKER ROBERT HIGGINS IS
STILL IN SHOCK SO SHE DIDN'T
WANT TO GO ON CAMERA. SHE WAS PICKING UP HIS TRUCK
WHERE HE LEFT IT AT WORK THE
DAY HE DIED. &gt;&gt; HIS PARENTS, SISTER.
EVERYBODY IS DEVASTATED.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: ROSHTS AND KELVIN MADDOX WERE KILLED WHILE
WORKING.
A WATER LINE BROKE CAUSING THE DIRT IN THE TRENCH TO BECOME
MUD.
FOR THE FIRST TIME THE OWNER KEVIN OTTO IS SPEAKING OUT
SAYING ALL OF US AT ATLANTIC
DRAIN SERVICE COMPANY ARE SADDENED AND SHOCKED BY THE
OFFENSE THAT CLAIMED THE LIVES
OF TWO FRIENDS AND EMPLOYEES. &gt;&gt; SO HAPPY TO BE WORKING THIS
JOB.

HAPPY.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: FOX25 UNCOVERED A LONG HISTORY OF OSHA VIOLATIONS
FOR THE COMPANY INCLUDING
REPEATED AND WOEFUL OFFENSES. SOME OF THE VIOLATIONS WERE FOR
TRENCH SAFETY.
THE COMPANY CURRENTLY OWES TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF
FINES TO OSHA WHICH IS IN
COLLECTIONS. THE COMPANY ONE OSHA'S SEVERE
VIOLATORS ONE OF 12 IN THE
STATE. WE TRIED TO ASK HIM ABOUT THE
SAFETY RECORD.
THE STATEMENT SAID WE TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN ENSURING THAT
OUR EMPLOYEES ARE OPERATING IN
SAFE AND SUPERVISED WORK SITES RILE ON ANY JOB.
HIGGINS FAMILY WANTS TO KNOW
HOW THIS COMPANY STAYS IN BUSINESS.
&gt;&gt; THEY CONTINUE TO GET JOBS.
WHY? &gt;&gt; Reporter: KEVIN OTTO DOES
HAVE A CONSTRUCTION SUPERVISOR
LICENSE WITH THE STATE. HE HAD TO PASS A DEGREES AND HE
REGULARLY HAVE TO FULFILL
CERTAIN TRAINING REQUIREMENTS, BUT THE BACKGROUND OF HIS
COMPANY IS NOT REVIEWED.

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; LOOKING AT ROADS, I DO NOT
BELIEVE THAT GRONK IS DRIVING
IN ANY LYFT CARS. ROUTE 1, 93 SOUTH MOVING ALONG
FINE.
NO ISSUES ON THE EXPRESSWAY. SPEED LIMIT RIDE FROM THE
BRAINTREE SPLIT TO COLUMBIA
ROAD AND VERY MANAGEABLE DRIVE TIMES.
FROM ROUTE 128 TO THE TOBIN.
OOH, JUST GAINED A MINUTE. DOWN INSTEAD OF GOING UP WHICH
IS WHAT WE WILL DO EARLY THIS
MORNING. 19 MINUTES ON 93 SOUTH.
23 MINUTES ON THE PIKE

      <description>AVENUE.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 4:48 RIGHT NOW.
METEOROLOGIST SHIRI SPEAR BACK WITH A FORECAST.
DID YOU HAVE TO LET YOUR CAR
HEAT UP EXTRA THIS MORNING? GIVE IT EXTRA TIME?
ALSO A LITTLE PROP, BECAUSE I
HAD TO BREAK THESE OUT. &gt;&gt; I THINK MOST PEOPLE WILL
HAVE TO BREAK THEM OUT THIS
MORNING, IF YOU ARE SPENDING ANY KIND OF SIGNIFICANT TIME
WAITING OUTSIDE FOR A BUS OR
ANYTHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE THERE IS A CHILL IN THE AIR.
COLDEST SO FAR THIS SEASON
BOSTON DOWN TO 38 DEGREES. THE CURRENT TEMPERATURE --
UNTIL NOW THE COLDEST WAS 42.
WORCESTER DOWN TO 31 AND THEY WERE STILL LOSING HEAT.
IN BOSTON, 38 DEGREES.
NICE CLEAR SKIES. NO RAIN EXPECTED TODAY.
STILL A LITTLE BIT BREEZY.
NOT THE SAME GUSTS WE HAD THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS BUT A
15-MILE-PER-HOUR BREEZE WILL
MAKE IT FEEL COOLER. WIND CHILL IS SOMETHING WE
SHOULD CONSIDER.
TEMPERATURES SINKING INTO PROBABLY THE UPPER 30s IN THE
BOSTON AREA.
WE COULD GET DOWN TO MAYBE 36 DEGREES WHICH MEANS FROST IS
LIKELY IN THE BEAU BOSTON AREA
BUT NOT A FREEZE. 10 A.M., 41 DEGREES.
BY NOONTIME, 45.
AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 40s AS WE ADD A COUPLE
SCATTERED CLOUDS.
TEMPERATURES COOLEST FROM BOSTON OVER TO WORCESTER AT 41.
AND NORTHWARD HERE.
MID-40s IN FRAMINGHAM, LOWELL AND NASHUA.
FURTHER SOUTH, TEMPERATURES
WILL BE SLIGHTLY WARMER IN THE 50s.
NOW MOVING ON, WE DO HAVE
CHANGES BREWING FOR TOMORROW. TRACKING MOUNTAIN SNOW INTO THE
BERKSHIRES AND WHITE MOUNTAINS.
INLAND, SLIGHT CHANCE WE WILL START OFF A LITTLE BIT OF A
LIGHT AND PATCHY, ICY MIX HERE
LATE MORNING AND EARLY AFTERNOON.
THAT WILL BE FAR INLAND.
HEAVY RAIN WILL BE THE MAIN CONCERN FOR ALL OF US HERE ON
THURSDAY NIGHT.
HERE IT IS. 7:00 TOMORROW MORNING.
I HAVE GOOD NEWS IN THE
FORECAST. ALTHOUGH IT IS GOING TO BE COLD
OUT THERE, MOST OF US START THE
DAY DRY. KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON THE
COASTLINE FOR DEVELOPING TOTALS
WITH NEAR FREEZING TEMPERATURES OVER THE NORTH SHORE HERE, AND
THIS COULD CREATE, AGAIN, THAT
SLIGHT RISK FOR A LITTLE BIT OF ICE OUT THAT WAY.
NOONTIME HERE MOSTLY DRY.
AGAIN WHERE WE GET THAT LITTLE BIT OF DRIZZLE.
IF IT GETS IN HERE A LITTLE
EARLIER AROUND NOON, WE WILL HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE
WORCESTER HILLS AND MERRIMACK
VALLEY AND NEW HAMPSHIRE FOR THAT LIGHT MIX.
THINGS WARM UP IN THE AFTERNOON
AND EVEN THOUGH A COLD RAIN, IT WILL BE PRIMARILY RAIN OUT
THERE.
4 P.M., THE BERKSHIRES SEEING THAT SNOW.
THE REST OF US GETTING IN ON
SHOWERS AND PICKING UP WITH INTENSITY DURING THE EVENING
COMMUTE THURSDAY NIGHT WHILE
YOU ARE SLEEPING. I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF
THERE WASN'T A RUM PWEM OF
THUNDER. COMING DOWN HARD THURSDAY NIGHT
AND FIRST HALF.
 COMMUTE ON FRIDAY MORNING. EXPECT WET ROADWAYS OUT THERE.
FRIDAY ENDS UP DRYING OUT.
I THINK THE ONLY LINGERING SHOWERS I EVEN SEE AS WE EASE
INTO THE LATE MORNING, EARLY
AFTERNOON UP INTO SOUTHERN NEW HAMPSHIRE.
THERE WE DRY OUT AS WELL
PRESIDENT NOT MUCH SUNSHINE BUT A COUPLE OF BREAKS IN THE
CLOUDS.
THE WINDS COME BACK INTO PLAY AS WE GET INTO FRIDAY AFTERNOON
AND TURNS SOMEWHAT BLUSTERY.
OF COURSE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FORECAST AFTER SUNSHINE TODAY.
WE HAVE CLOUDS AND DEVELOPING
RAIN TOMORROW. FRIDAY STARTS WITH RAIN AND
ENDS WITH WIND.
SATURDAY, A SLIGHT RISK OF A SHOWER.
UPPER 50s BOTH DAYS WHICH IS
NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF THE YEAR AMEND ONLY A SLIGHT CHANCE
OF A SUNDAY SHOWER KEEPING
THINGS PARTLY CLOUDY.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; A MESSAGE IN ITS BOTTLE IS
COMING BACK.
ERIKA RICCI SAT DOWN WITH THE DAUGHTER THAT PENNED THE
LETTER.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THE MESSAGE IS SHORT.
SOME WORDS ARE NOT EVEN
LEGIBLE. &gt;&gt; OH, MY GOD.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THIS SINGLE PIECE
OF PAPER OPENS THE DOORS OF COUNTLESS STORIES OF PAULA
PIERCE'S FAMILY PAST AS OWNERS
OF THE BEACHCOMBER MOTEL ON HAMPTON BEACH.
&gt;&gt; WE WERE VERY CLOSE AND I
SPENT A LOT OF YEARS WORKING THAT MOTEL.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: SHORTLY AFTER HER
PARENTS PAUL AND TINA BOUGHT THE MOTEL IN THE 1960s, HER
FATHER LAUNCHED THIS MESSAGE IN
THE BOTTLE ACROSS THE STREET AS A JOKE ON HIS WIFE AND ONLY
TOLD PAULA'S HUSBAND, MARK
ABOUT IT. &gt;&gt; I KEPT IT CLOSE TO MY HEART
AND KEPT MY MOUTH SHUT.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THE BOTTLE WAS FORGOTTEN ABOUT BUT NOT BY THE
TIDE, TRAVELED 1400 MILES TO
THE CARIBBEAN ISLAND OF THE TURKS AND CAICOS WHERE IT
WASHED ASHORE AND 50 YEARS
LATER IN 2011 WAS FOUND BY A MAN FROM UTAH ON VACATION.
&gt;&gt; CLINT'S PART IN THIS IS
INCREDIBLE. &gt;&gt; Reporter: TOOK TWO MONTHS TO
DECODE THE MESSAGE AND TRACK
DOWN THE AUTHOR BUT PAULA'S PARENTS HAVE SINCE PASSED AND
HE GOT IN TOUCH WITH HER AND
FIVE YEARS LATER WAS ABLE TO REUNITE HER WITH THIS PIECE OF
HER PAST.
&gt;&gt; I KIND OF DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
I JUST HELD IT VERY GENTLY AND
LOOKED AT IT, AND HOW DID IT END UP BACK IN MY HANDS.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: ONE MAN TRAVELED
BY PLANE, TRAIN AND BUS TO GET IT THERE.
&gt;&gt; HE SAID I CAN'T MAIL IT.
I HAVE TO PUT THIS IN YOUR HANDS.
I HAVE TO PUT THIS IN YOUR
HANDS AND THAT'S WHAT HE DID. &gt;&gt; Reporter: THE BEACHCOMBER
MOTEL WAS SOLD IN 2014 AND FOR
PAULA IT WAS HARD TO SAY GOODBYE.
SHE SAYS HAVING THIS MESSAGE
NOW GIVES HER A LITTLE PIECE OF HER FAMILY LEGACY.
IN HAMPTON BEACH, ERIKA RICCI,
FOX25 NEWS. &gt;&gt; Julie:  WHAT AN UNIQUE WAY
TO CONNECT WITH THE PASS.
&gt;&gt; THE EFFORT THIS MAN THAT FOUND THIS NOTE TO GET IT BACK
TO THEM.

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; THIS DEADLY CRASH IN
MIDDLEBOROUGH IS THE FOURTH
WRONG-WAY CRASH WE HAVE REPORTED ON IN RECENT MONTHS.
WE SENT FOX25'S JOHN MONAHAN TO
THE GOVERNOR TO SEE IF SOMETHING CAN BE DONE TO
PREVENT THESE TYPES OF CRASHES
FROM HAPPENING SO OFTEN. &gt;&gt; MY HEART BREAKS FOR
EVERYBODY INVOLVED IN THAT.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: GOVERNOR CHARLIE BAKER EXPRESSES HIS SYMPATHIES
FOR THE SUDDEN AND TRAGIC DEATH
FOR MONDAY'S WRONG-WAY CRASH ON 495.
HE TELLS FOX25 THAT HE HAS
ASKED HIS STAFF TO SEE HOW THIS TYPE OF ACCIDENT CAN BE
PREVENTED.
&gt;&gt; TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WE CAN DO WITH RESPECT TO SIGNAGE TO
DEAL WITH THIS SORT OF THING SO
PEOPLE DON'T GET ON THE WRONG ROAD GOING IN THE WRONG
DIRECTION.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: STATE POLICE HAVE IDed THE WRONG DRIVER AS
VALENTIN VERSEN, HE CRASHED
HEAD-ON INTO A CAR KILLING ALL FOUR PEOPLE IN THE VEHICLE.
SHE, TOO, DIED IN THE CRASH.
THE FOUR VICTIMS KRAIG DIGGS, TROY GALVIN.
18-YEAR-OLD CORY LACADA OF WEST
BABYLON, AND 19-YEAR-OLD JORDAN FISCHER OF HARWICH.
DRIVING SOUTH IN THE SOUTHBOUND
LANES, WHY REMAINS UNDER INVESTIGATION, BUT GOVERNOR
BAKER SAYS HE BLAMES NO ONE.
THIS, HE SAYS, THIS SEASON AWFUL TRAGEDY AND HE ADMITS
THAT ON-AND-OFF RAMPS IN
MASSACHUSETTS CAN BE HARD TO NAVIGATE.
&gt;&gt; SOME OF THEM CAN GET
CONFUSING AND OBVIOUSLY THIS WOMAN GOT CONFUSED AT THIS ONE.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: I AM JOHN MONAHAN,
FOX25 NEWS. &gt;&gt; WE PULLED THE DRIVING RECORD
BETWEEN 200 HAD AND 2015  SHE
GOT FIVE SPEEDING TICKETS SPLIT BETWEEN MASSACHUSETTS AND RHODE

      <description>WESTON TOLLS.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 4:17.
METEOROLOGIST SHIRI SPEAR JOINING US WITH THE FORECAST.
IT'S COLD.
&gt;&gt; Julie:  YOU SAID THE RECORD COLD.
&gt;&gt; Shiri:  THE LOW --
&gt;&gt; Julie:  SHOULD WE HIGH FIVE, SO IS HE CELEBRATE.
&gt;&gt; Shiri:  SHOULD WE CRY.
I AM NOR SURE. &gt;&gt; Daniel:  I BROUGHT THE
GLOVES AND HAT.
&gt;&gt; Shiri:  IT IS CHILLY AND INVITE TO YOU DO THE SAME FOR
YOUR KIDS, FOR YOURSELF.
A BETTER FREEZE WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 A.M.
UNTIL 9:00, TEMPERATURES IN THE
UPPER 20s, LOWER 30s ON MY MAP. A COOL, DRY AND PARTLY SUNNY
DAY AHEAD.
RAIN IS COMING FORWARD US TOMORROW, AND WHEN IT INITIALLY
MOVES IN, IT IS GOING TO BE
SNOW OUT IN AREAS LIKE THE BERKSHIRES.
SO CURRENTLY LOOK AT WHAT A
QUIET MORNING WORCESTER DOWN TO 31 DEGREES.
BOSTON, 38.
YOUR FIRST MORNING IN THE 30s THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN BOSTON.
PLYMOUTH, 33.
GO OUT TO PLYMOUTH RIGHT NOW TALKING CLEAR SKIES WHICH IS
GREAT NEWS.
FEELS LIKE ONLY 26 THOUGH BECAUSE THAT LITTLE BIT OF A
BREEZE OUT THERE AND THAT ADDED
CHILL FROM THE WIND. 6 A.M. TEMPERATURE DOWN TO 34
DEGREES.
I DON'T EXPECT THAT WE ARE REALLY GOING TO WARM UP BY,
LIKE, 6, 7:00 THIS MORNING IF
ANYTHING. TEMPERATURES PROBABLY GO DOWN
ONE OR TWO MORE DEGREES.
STILL IN THE LOW TO MID-30s AT 8 A.M.
10 A.M., 41 DEGREES.
WELCOME BACK TO THE 40s, BUT HIGHS IN THE UPPER 40s TODAY.
THE WARM-UP WILL BE INCREDIBLY
LIMITED. SOMEWHERE LIKE LAWRENCE
STARTING OFF FROSTY AT 36
DEGREES. AT RISK OF SEEING FREEZING
TEMPERATURES BEFORE THE WARM-UP
START. THERE YOU HAVE IT AT 8 A.M.,
35.
AND HIGHS THERE IN THE 40s. 47 IN BOSTON AND LAWRENCE AND
IPSWICH.
49 IN NORWOOD AND COUPLE OF 50s IN PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND.
THE WEATHER MAKER SHIFTING
TOWARD US. THE START OF THE MORNING
COMMUTE IS LOOKING FINE AND WE
ARE LOOKING FOR A CUP OF SPRINKLES ALONG THE COASTLINE
AND THICKENING CLOUDS.
7 A.M. TEMPERATURES OBVIOUSLY VERY CHILLY.
20s AND 30s ON THE MAP.
THE SPEED OF GETTING THAT COLD AIR OUT OF HERE IS THE CONCERN.
10 O'CLOCK, STILL THE RISK TO
HAVE SHOWER OVER THE SOUTH SHORE AND THE CAPE.
IT WILL BE DRIZZLE AS WE GET
IT. AFTER 10 A.M., THE RISK FOR
SHOWERS START GOING UP AND BY 2
P.M., I HAVE VERY LIGHT PRECIPITATION ON THE MAP.
MY CONCERN IS, IF WE GET IT IN
HERE EARLY ENOUGH. EVEN IF IT IS VERY, VERY LIGHT
COULD BOIL DOWN INTO ICY
CONDITIONS AFTER 2 P.M. RAIN TEMPERATURES IN THE LOW TO
MID-40s.
THE SNOW WILL BE RESTRICTED OUT TO THE BERKSHIRES, VERMONT,
PERHAPS LEAKING OUT TOWARD THE
MANADANOCKS AS LIGHT ACCUMULATION.
THE RAIN REALLY PICKING UP IN
INTENSITY. IT WILL BE HEAVIEST THURSDAY
NIGHT INTO FRIDAY MORNING.
AS YOU CAN SEE, WASHOUT FRIDAY MORNING.
AND TEMPERATURES ARE WARM
ENOUGH THAT IT IS PRIMARILY RAIN, AND WE ARE TALKING A LOT
OF IT TOO.
WE ARE LOOKING AT AN INCH IN WORCESTER.
THREE QUARTERS OF AN INCH IN
BOSTON. DOWNPOUR POTENTIAL IS THERE.
FRIDAY INTO THE WEEKEND,
TEMPERATURES ARE A LITTLE MORE NORMAL IN THE MID- TO UPPER
50s.
THE SEVEN-DAY FORECAST WITH WEEKEND ALWAYS IN VIEW, 48
TODAY.
IT IS GOING TO BE BRIGHT OUT THERE, BUT TOMORROW WE HAVE
THAT DEVELOPING RAIN AND WE
WILL HAVE TO WATCH OUT FOR UNLAND TOWNS AND CITIES
STARTING OUT -- LATE MORNING OR
EARLY AFTERNOON. HEAVY RAIN FRIDAY MORNING
SHOULD END 8 TO 10 A.M. AND DRY
AND INTO THE WEEKEND, SLIGHT</description>

      <description>RIGHT, THIS IS WHAT IT'S ALL
ABOUT.
FAMILY AND FIGHTING. OH, HEAD BUTTS AND PUNCHES.
&gt;&gt; OH.
&gt;&gt; AND A FULL-ON BRAWL. &gt;&gt; TOTALLY NORMAL.
JUST ANOTHER AFTERNOON WITH THE
FAM. &gt;&gt; WAS THIS THE BRIDE AND
GROOM'S FAMILY?
&gt;&gt; NO REAL WORD AS TO WHOSE CAMP THEY BELONG TO, BUT THE GOOD
NEWS IS, THEY'VE GATHERED
EVERYBODY INVOLVED IN THIS FIGHT, THREW THEM OUT OF THE
WEDDING HALL AND SAID GET OUT.
&gt;&gt; GOOD. &gt;&gt; YEAH, THEY'VE BEEN KICKED
OUT.
LOOK OUT! &gt;&gt; HOLY COW, WHAT IS HAPPENING?
&gt;&gt; WOW, THAT ESCALATED QUICKLY.
&gt;&gt; WHEN THE OTHER GUY IN THE FIGHT WAS DRIVING AWAY, HE SAW
AN OPPORTUNITY AND SAID, POW!
AND TOOK OFF. POLICE ARE STILL LOOKING FOR
THIS GUY.
FOUR GUYS WERE TRANSPORTED TO THE HOSPITAL.
NO WORD HOW SEVERE THE INJURIES
WERE. YOU SEE TWO GET UP.
NEXT VIDEO INSIDE A FAST FOOD
RESTAURANT. POOR GIRL HAD NO IDEA WHAT
STRUCK HER IN THE BACK OF THE
HEAD. IT WAS A BEER CAN.
LOOK AT THIS GUY IN THE CIRCLE.
WINGS THAT BEER CAN. HAD NO IDEA HIS UNINTENDED
TARGET GOT HIT.
HE WAS INTOXICATED. WHEN YOU PUT THESE TWO VIDEOS
TOGETHER, HE WALKS RIGHT PAST
HER. SHE HAS NO IDEA THAT'S THE GUY
WHO CAUSED HER HEAD TO RING.
&gt;&gt; LITTLE BOY IS TRYING TO HELP AND GOES CHECK ON HER.
THAT'S REALLY SWEET.
&gt;&gt; YEP. THIS GUY WALKS RIGHT ON BY,
DISAPPEARS OUT THE DOOR.
POLICE ALSO LOOKING FOR THAT GUY.
&gt;&gt; THE VIDEO I'M ABOUT TO SHOW
YOU IS MAKING A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE INTERNET QUITE UPSET.
NEEDLESS TO SAY, IT IS GOING
CRAZY VIRAL. THIS IS IN TURKEY.
IT'S BEEN BLURRED AND FOR A VERY
GOOD REASON. THAT MAN IS SAID TO BE A FATHER
OF FIVE.
THE CHILD, THE BOY NEXT TO HIM, A 3 YEAR OLD, IS SAID TO BE HIS
SON.
IT DOES APPEAR AS THOUGH THE MAN IS GIVING HIS CHILD A BEER.
&gt;&gt; DAD OF THE YEAR RIGHT THERE,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. &gt;&gt; A LOT OF RESPONSIBLE ADULTS
OUT THERE DON'T FIND THIS
PARTICULARLY FUNNY. &gt;&gt; SO WHAT?
EVERYBODY'S SO QUICK TO JUDGE
AND THEY DON'T HAVE ANY CONCEPT OF WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON IN THE
VIDEO.
&gt;&gt; QUESTION IS, ARE THEY BREAKING THE LAW?
IN THE UK YOU ARE LEGALLY ALLOW
TO GIVE YOUR OWN CHILDREN ALCOHOL TO THE AGE OF 4 IF YOU
REALLY WANTED TO.
YOU'RE NOT BREAKING THE LAW. EVERYONE IS MAKING A SNAP
JUDGMENT OFF WHAT LOOKS LIKE A
14-SECOND VIDEO. &gt;&gt; NO WORD WHETHER AUTHORITIES
ARE INVOLVED OR ARE
INVESTIGATING, BUT WE DO KNOW IT IS ILLEGAL TO GIVE CHILDREN
UNDER THE AGE OF 18 ANY ALCOHOL.
BUT I THINK WHAT PEOPLE ARE REALLY REACTING TO IS NOT
WHETHER IT'S LEGAL OR NOT, BUT
WHETHER IT'S CORRECT OR NOT FOR THE FUTURE OF THE CHILD.
&gt;&gt; THE KID PROBABLY WON'T HAVE
AN ALCOHOL PROBLEM. I REMEMBER SOME GUYS GIVING MY
LITTLE SISTER A SIP OF BEER WHEN
SHE WAS 2 AT A FOURTH OF JULY PARTY.
I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS RIGHT AND
I STILL DON'T.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; MY THOUGHTS ARE CONSUMED
WITH WHAT DO THEY PUT ON THE
INSURANCE FORM? &gt;&gt; CCTV FROM CHINA.
INSIDE A GROCERY WAREHOUSE.
DOINK! &gt;&gt; WHAT?
&gt;&gt; IS THAT LIKE A FLAT BED?
&gt;&gt; IT'S A MOTORIZED TRICYCLE, YES, FLAT BED.
THESE TWO LADIES SAY THEY
COULDN'T STOP IT, BECAUSE THE FLOORS.
AS YOU COULD SEE, BACK STRAIGHT
INTO THE DOOR, COMPLETELY OPENS UP.
&gt;&gt; DELIVERY ELEVATOR?
&gt;&gt; YES, YES. THAT IS AN ELEVATOR.
THEY HAVE THIS BROKEN THROUGH
AND CRASHED DOWN INTO. HOWEVER, BY THE LOOKS OF IT,
WE'RE STILL ON THE GROUND TLOOR.
&gt;&gt; STILL A DROP, THOUGH. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN SEE IT HAPPEN, BANG,
RIGHT THERE, EVENTUALLY SETTLES
TO THE SIDE. THE VIDEO CUTS AND WE SEE THE
RESCUE PEOPLE TRYING TO FIGURE
THIS ONE OUT. EVENTUALLY YOU CAN SEE THE WOMEN
ARE FORCED OUT, MIRACULOUSLY
MINOR INJURIES IF THAT. THEY ARE EVENTUALLY TAKEN OFF
AND YOU CAN SEE WHERE THIS
TRICYCLE ENDED UP. DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW THEY THINK
THEY ARE GOING TO GET THIS ONE
OUT OF HERE. IT'S PRETTY NICELY JAMMED IN.
&gt;&gt; IMAGINE HAVING EXPLAINED
THAT. &gt;&gt; WHAT HAPPENED?
THIS IS WHAT I MEAN.
&gt;&gt; INSURANCE FORM MUST BE JUST BRILLIANT.
&gt;&gt; JUST GO TO THE VIDEO.
&gt;&gt; IT'S TIME TO GIVE AWAY ANOTHER iPAD MINI.
&gt;&gt; TO ENTER YOU'RE GOING TO NEED
TUESDAY'S BUZZ WORD, BE AT LEAST 21 YEARS OLD AND A LEGAL
RESIDENT OF THE U.S. OR CANADA.
&gt;&gt; "RTM" BUZZ WORD COMING UP IN JUST A BIT.
&gt;&gt; STAND BY EVERYONE FOR THE
"RTM" iPAD MINI GIVEAWAY.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; I GOT A COUPLE OF FAIL
VIDEOS FOR YOU.
I DON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING MORE THAN THAT.
THAT'S SOMEBODY'S PET FROG.
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. &gt;&gt; MISSED IT.
&gt;&gt; DOES THE POOR FROG NEED
GLASSES? &gt;&gt; I COULD WATCH THIS OVER AND
OVER.
IF YOU NOTICE, THE FROG WAS ABLE TO STAY ATTACHED TO ITS OWNER
AND NOT COMPLETELY FALL DOWN.
MEANWHILE, THE INSECT IS LIKE -- &gt;&gt; STILL GOING TO GET HIM.
WE'RE ALL SITTING HERE LAUGHING
LIKE WE'VE NEVER MADE A MISTAKE. &gt;&gt; SPEAK FOR YOURSELF.
&gt;&gt; THIS POOR FROG CAN'T CUT A
BREAK. IN ANOTHER VIDEO POSTED BY THE
OWNER, YOU SEE THE FROG TRYING
TO GO FOR THE FISH, BUT AS YOU CAN SEE, TWO PANES OF GLASS
BETWEEN THEM.
DOESN'T STOP HIM FROM TRYING. &gt;&gt; HE'S FOCUSED ON IT, TOO.
I'M GOING TO GET YOU.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S A LITTLE UNFAIR. SAD, KIND OF CRUEL.
&gt;&gt; YOU SENSITIVE?
YOU WANT A COOKIE? &gt;&gt; YOU SEE RIGHT THERE, IN THIS
VIRAL VIDEO, UK VIDEO --
&gt;&gt; WHOA! &gt;&gt; THOSE ARE INSECTS, COMMON IN
SOUTH ASIA AND THEY ARE KNOWN TO
BE SOME OF THE BEST CAMOUFLAGED ANIMALS IN THE ANIMAL KINGDOM.
&gt;&gt; WHY DO THEY CALL THEM LEAF
INSECTS? &gt;&gt; I CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT,
STRANGE.
&gt;&gt; THEY LIVE IN AREAS WHERE IT'S MOSTLY GREEN.
CAN YOU IMAGINE BEING UNDER THE
TREE, THOUGH.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; THERE ARE A LOT OF FAMILIES
THAT WHEN BABY GIRL GETS
MARRIED, IT'S A BIG DEAL. IT'S OVER THE TOP.
WELL, HE'S CATCHING A LOT OF
FLAK FOR JUST HOW BIG HE WENT FOR HIS DAUGHTER.
THESE ARE THE INVITATIONS THAT
THE FAMILY SENT OUT. IT FEATURES A BEAUTIFUL
DECORATED BOX AND WHEN YOU OPEN
THE BOX, THERE'S A BOLLYWOOD STYLE MOVIE PLAYING ON AN LCD
SCREEN, SO YOU KNOW THEY SPENT A
PRETTY PENNY ON THESE INVITATIONS.
&gt;&gt; IF THEY GOT IT, WHY NOT?
&gt;&gt; HERE'S THE THING, HE IS ONE OF INDIA'S RICHEST POLITICIANS,
HOWEVER --
&gt;&gt; I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT, RICHEST POLITICIAN.
&gt;&gt; HE WAS STRIPPED OF HIS TITLE
AND SENT TO JAIL FOR THREE YEARS FOR TAX EVASION.
&gt;&gt; OKAY, WELL, NOW WE'VE GOT A
PROBLEM. &gt;&gt; HE'S OUT ON BAIL AND PLANNING
THIS WEDDING AND IT'S RUBBING
PEOPLE THE WRONG WAY BECAUSE OF HIS HISTORY AND BECAUSE OF THE
LAVISH STYLE WHICH THEY ARE
GOING ABOUT IT. THE OTHER THING, THE WEDDING IS
SET TO TAKE PLACE NEXT MONTH.
IT'S GOING TO LAST ABOUT 11 DAYS, IT'S GOING TO COST ABOUT
$82 MILLION.
&gt;&gt; SHUT THE FRONT DOOR. &gt;&gt; $82 MILLION?
&gt;&gt; HOLY -- THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
&gt;&gt; HOW MANY PEOPLE CAN YOU FEED WITH THAT MONEY?
&gt;&gt; COME ON, IT'S GOING TO RUB
PEOPLE THE WRONG WAY. &gt;&gt; WHAT'S IN THAT BAG?
&gt;&gt; YOUNG McDONALD HAD A GATOR
FARM. 35, HE TEACHES HIS 2 YEAR OLD
HOW TO HANDLE THE GATORS.
&gt;&gt; E, I, E, I, O. &gt;&gt; HE'S BEEN AROUND GATORS ALL
HIS LIFE, GROWN UP ON THE FARM
AND WRESTLING HIS POOR GATOR FOR A LONG TIME.
NOW DAD'S DECIDED IT'S TIME TO
LET JUNIOR LOOSE. THERE HE GOES.
&gt;&gt; ONE, TWO, THREE, JUMP.
OH, GOOD CATCH. &gt;&gt; LOOK AT THAT.
LOOK.
HONESTLY, PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BLOW THEIR MINDS ABOUT THIS
VIDEO.
DAD HAS BEEN TEACHING HIM WELL. SEE HOW HE DID IT ABSOLUTELY
PERFECTLY?
&gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE GOING TO LIVE ON A GATOR FARM, RESPONSIBLE THING TO
DO IS TEACH THE KID HOW TO
HANDLE THE GATORS, HOW TO BE AROUND THEM.
&gt;&gt; NAILED IT.
I LOVE THEY PUT THE GO PRO ON, AS WELL.
THAT WAS TEXTBOOK.
&gt;&gt; NEXT VIDEO, IN THE CAR WITH HIS LITTLE BABY GIRL.
BABY GIRL KNOWS ONE WORD.
SO, SHE WORKS WITH HER. âª CAN YOU TAKE ME --

USING THE WORD -- âª BABY THERE AIN'T NO
MOUNTAIN --
&gt;&gt; HIGH. âª ENOUGH âª
&gt;&gt; THAT'S CREATIVE, TOO.
&gt;&gt; KNOWS THAT ONE WORD AND DAD'S WORKING WITH IT QUITE PERFECTLY.
QUITE LITTLE SING-A-LONG.

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; I KNOW SHE LOOKS HUNCHED
OVER, BUT THIS DOG IS VERY
HAPPY. LIFE WASN'T THAT GREAT FOR HER
BEFORE SHE WAS PICKED UP BY THE
ANIMAL RESCUE IN POLAND. THEY SAID THAT SHE WAS LIVING IN
A CAGE CRAMPED IN HER FECES
WAITING TO DIE. HER HEALTH, OBVIOUSLY, NOT
OPTIMAL, BUT BECAUSE SHE WAS
RESCUED, THEY WERE ABLE TO GIVE HER A NEW LIFE.
THEY SAY THAT SHE SUFFERS FROM
CONTRACTORS, WHEN YOUR MUSCLES HARDEN AND SHORTEN AND THAT'S
WHAT SHE SUFFERED FROM.
THEY THINK THAT MASSAGING HER LEGS FOR MORE MOBILITY.
&gt;&gt; I THOUGHT SHE WAS DOING THAT
PERFECTLY, YOU KNOW, THEY'LL HUNKER DOWN TO SHOW THEY ARE
SUBMISSIVE TO YOU.
&gt;&gt; WEIRDLY ENOUGH, IT'S THE SAME THING THAT HAPPENS TO ALL PEOPLE
WHEN WE SIT AT WORK ALL DAY,
ACTUALLY SHORTENS THE HIP MUSCLES, YOU HAVE TO STRETCH
THEM OUT.
&gt;&gt; RIGHT THERE, SHE'S UP ON ALL FOURS, SHE'S OKAY, THEN SHE
HUNCHES BACK DOWN.
THIS DOG NOW HAS A NEW LEASH ON LIFE, SO TO SPEAK, BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT THE GOOD THING IS, THEY
RESCUED HER, BECAUSE CRAMPED IN A CAGE IN HER FECES, THINKING
THAT'S SOME KIND OF LIFE.
&gt;&gt; JUST CRUEL. &gt;&gt; THAT'S IT.
FUNDAMENTALLY RIGHT THERE,
HAPPENS TO BE ALIVE. HAPPY TO HAVE SOMEONE TO PLAY
WITH.
&gt;&gt; GOOD THING IS, SHE NOW HAS A NEW HOME.
&gt;&gt; OH, MY GOSH, THIS VIDEO IS
PROBABLY, IF YOU'RE LIKE ME, GOING TO MAKE YOU FEEL SO
USELESS.
&gt;&gt; SHE PICKS UP THESE WEIGHTS ON EACH HAND, GETS DOWN IN A SQUAT,
LIFTS THEM OVER HER HEAD AND
THEN STARTS LUNGING. &gt;&gt; THAT, I'D HAVE A CONCUSSION
WITHIN ABOUT .5 SECONDS.
FALL ON MY NOGGIN. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN SEE WHY SHE'S SO
STRONG FROM HEAD TO TOE, THE
AMOUNT OF STABILIZING SHE'S HAVING TO DO.
NO WONDER SHE LOOKS SO
INCREDIBLE. &gt;&gt; WHO IS THIS SUPER HUMAN?
&gt;&gt; THIS SUPER HUMAN IS A
PERSONAL TRAINER. &gt;&gt; NO.
&gt;&gt; STRENGTH MOTIVATOR.
&gt;&gt; I'M SHOCKED. &gt;&gt; SHE'S KIND OF AWESOME.
BUT ALSO WATCH THIS.
SHE SAYS IT TOOK HER AN HOUR TO BE ABLE TO PULL THIS MOVE OFF.
&gt;&gt; OH!
&gt;&gt; THOSE ARE TWO BENCHES BACKED UP ON EACH OTHER.
SHE'S JUMPING ON TOP OF BOTH OF
THEM, ROLLING UNDER AND DOING IT</description>

      <description>WHEN I USED TO THROW THEM IN.
&gt;&gt; NEVER GIVE UP.
&gt;&gt; A COMEDIAN THAT A LOT OF YOUNG BLACK CHURCH KIDS IDENTIFY
WITH.
&gt;&gt; AIN'T NO TRICK OR TREAT IN THIS HOUSE.
AIN'T NO DEVILS IN THIS HOUSE.
WE'RE GOING TO REVIVAL! &gt;&gt; IT'S EXAGGERATED, OF COURSE,
BUT GROWING UP WE DIDN'T GO
TRICK OR TREATING. WE WENT TO THE HARVEST FESTIVAL.
&gt;&gt; AIN'T NO TRICK, AIN'T NO
TREAT, AIN'T NO DEVIL STANDING BETWEEN ME AND HEAVEN.
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE HARVEST NIGHT AT
CHURCH TONIGHT, SO WE CAN DRESS UP AS BIBLE CHARACTERS.
JOE, YOU'RE GOING TO BE NAKED,
COVER YOURSELF UP WITH THESE AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE ADAM.
&gt;&gt; AND NOW TODAY, LITTLE MORE
LENIENCY. &gt;&gt; WE CAN WEAR COSTUMES, BUT NO
GHOULS AND GOBLINS.
YOU CAN BE A NINJA FOR THE LORD AND YOU CAN BE BATMAN FIGHTING
THE DARKNESS OF THE DEVIL.
&gt;&gt; SEEMS LIKE A GOOD COMPROMISE. &gt;&gt; RIGHT NOW KEVIN IS ON TOUR,
SO HE'S GOING VIRAL FOR ANOTHER
REASON. &gt;&gt; ME AND GREG ARE STUCK IN AN
ELEVATOR.
&gt;&gt; WOW, IT'S WRITING HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; HE'S PERISCOPING THE ENTIRE
THING.
PEOPLE ON THE INTERNET ARE JUST RUDE.
SOMEBODY WROTE --
&gt;&gt; FAT KID BROKE IT. REALLY, THAT'S HOW YOU FEEL?
KIND OF HURT MY FEELINGS.
ME AND GREG BEEN WORKING OUT HARD.
I'M FIVE POUNDS LIGHTER, WHY
WOULD YOU SAY THAT? &gt;&gt; THEY ARE IN THERE FOREVER
UNTIL SOMEONE IS ABLE TO GET
THEM OUT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH!
&gt;&gt; NOW HE CAN GET ON TO WORK,
BUT BEFORE HE DOES, WE'VE GOT HIM LIVE VIA SKYPE "RIGHT THIS
MINUTE."
WELCOME, CAM! LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR SKETCHES,
BECAUSE THEY GO VIRAL THE SECOND
YOU PUT THEM UP. WHY DO YOU THINK PEOPLE IDENTIFY
SO WELL?
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, I JUST TRY TO MAKE THINGS THAT ARE VERY SPECIFIC TO
MY LIFE.
YOU JUST HIT WHAT RESINATES WITH PEOPLE IF YOU ARE REALLY
AUTHENTIC, WHICH I PLAN AND HOPE
TO BE, GUYS. &gt;&gt; TELL US ABOUT YOUR
EXPERIENCES AS A KID ON
HALLOWEEN, HOW MUCH OF THAT SKETCH WAS YOUR LIFE?
&gt;&gt; OH, THAT WAS 100% MY LIFE.
MY MOM CALLS ME ONCE A WEEK AND COMPLAINS ABOUT THE VIDEOS THAT
I MAKE BECAUSE THEY ARE TELLING
ON HER, BUT THIS IS MY LIFE. SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE HELD ME FROM
HALLOWEEN FOR SO MANY YEARS.
I WOULDN'T HAVE THESE EMOTIONAL SCARS.
&gt;&gt; YOUR VIDEOS ARE HILARIOUS.
WHY DO YOU DO THEM? YOUR BREAD AND BUTTER, DO YOU DO
THIS FOR FUN?
&gt;&gt; EXACTLY. I DO THEM FOR FUN BECAUSE I'M
BORED.
NOT MANY PEOPLE WILL PERISCOPE WHEN THEY GET STUCK IN AN
ELEVATOR, BUT HEY, MAN, WHEN
LIFE HAPPENS, RECORD IT. &gt;&gt; DON'T YOU THINK THAT SHOWS A
LACK OF FAITH YOU DIDN'T LAY
HANDS ON THE DOOR AND THEY DIDN'T OPEN, YOU HAD TO WAIT FOR
SOMEBODY TO HELP YOU?
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY. YOU'RE 100% CORRECT.
MY FAITH IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO
OPEN DOORS. I PRAYED BEFORE AND COULDN'T GET
THE DOOR OPEN, SO I JUST CALLED
THE PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE A PLETHORA OF THINGS
THAT YOU DO AND YOU'RE ON TOUR
NOW. HOW CAN WE FIND YOU?
&gt;&gt; THE EASIEST WAY IS
KEVONSTAGE.COM. FIRST PAGE OF MY WEBSITE, YOU'LL

RECENT POLLS AND SHOWING HIM TRAILING HICK BY WIDE MARGIN.
&gt;&gt; I THINK WE ARE WINNING AND
WHAT THEY DO IS SHOW THE PHONY POLLS HEAVILY WEIGHTED WITH
DEMOCRATS.
WATCH THE POLLS BECAUSE THIS IS PART OF THE CROOKED SYSTEM.
&gt;&gt; Daniel: TRUMP SUGGESTING
THE POLLING IS PART OF EFFORT TO MANIPULATE THE ELECTION.

ASKED TO PAY BACKBONEUSES REENLISTING IN NATIONAL GUARD
AND NEEDED MORE SOLDIERS TO
FIGHT IN AFGHANISTAN. CALIFORNIA GUARD OFFICIALS

THAT COMES WITH IT AND TAKE BACK
TO CONGRESS UNTIL THEY CAN COME UP WITH A SOLUTION.
&gt;&gt; Daniel: PREMIUM FOR
MID-LEVEL PLANS AVERAGE 25% AND ESTIMATED 20% CONSUMERS WILL
ONLY HAVE ONE INSURER TO CHOOSE

HERE IS LIVE LOOK AT ZAKIM
BRIDGE WHERE YOU CAN SEE STALLED CARR OFF ON LEFT-HAND LANE SO
CARS JUST SLOWLY CREEPING BY AND
THAT JUST CREATING A BIT OF PROBLEM.
HERE ARE LIVE DRIVE TIMES,
THOUGH. LIKE THEM SEEING COME DOWN ON 93
AND HOUR AND 15 MINUTES AND BIG
IMPROVEMENT ON TRIPLE DIGITS AND HOUR RIDE ON 128 SOUTH FROM
ROUTE 1 IN PEABODY TO THE WESTON
TOLLS. &gt;&gt; SITTING OUT IN TRAFFIC.
HAVE HEAT ON.
&gt;&gt; WARM BEVERAGE WITH YOU AND GOING TO BE LIKE THIS FOR THE
NEXT COUPLE MORNINGS, SO
WHATEVER IT IS GET YOU THROUGH THE MORNING COMMUTE COMFORTABLY
YOU GOT TO ENDULL BELIEVE
YOURSELF TODAY. HIGH TEMPERATURES GETTING UP TO
ABOUT 50 TODAY AND NORMAL 58 AND
TENÂ° BELOW AVERAGE FOR THE WEDNESDAY, FOR THURSDAY AND
THESE ARE NOVEMBER LIKE HIGHS.
THESE ARE NOT OCTOBER LIKE HIGHS.
KIND OF BACK TO NORMAL ON FRIDAY
AND SATURDAY BUT IT IS NOT GOING TO BE PICTURE PERFECT.
RIGHT NOW LOOKS GREAT AND SUN
SHINING AND FEELS LIKE IT IS FREEZING BECAUSE OF THE 15 MILES
PER HOUR SUSTAINED WINDS.
I'M GOING TO BE BREAKING DOWN THE STRONGER GUSTS IN COUPLE
MINUTES.
BUT OUT AT 11:00 THIS MORNING I GOT IT AT 40 IN WORCESTER AND
HIGH TEMPERATURE IN THE LOWER
40s, THAT'S IT AND LUCKILY GO HIGHER THAN THAT AND MOST TOWNS
AND CITIES AND HIGHER ELEVATIONS
REALLY REALLY CAPPED AND SPOTS LIKE PLYMOUTH, NORWOOD, NEW
BEDFORD, OVER THE CAPE AND
ISLANDS AND OVERNIGHT BACK TO THE 30s, FROSTY IN BOSTON,
GOING TO BE FREEZING AND A LOT
OF THE SUBURBS HERE AND WE ARE GOING TO REACH THOSE
TEMPERATURES AS SUN COMES UP
TOMORROW, SO SEVEN AIM, A LOT OF KIDS HEADED TO SCHOOL, HEADED TO
WORK AND LIKE TODAY, TOUGH TO
GET UP TO 50Â°, SO IT IS GOING TO BE THE COOLER DAYS HERE, DON'T
THINK SHORT SLEEVES WILL SERVE
YOU VERY WELL FOR THE NEXT FEW, BREEZY CONDITIONS TODAY WITH
GUSTS 20 TO 30 MILES PER HOUR,
COLD WITH THOSE 30s WHEN YOU WAKE UP IT WERE MORNING AND
QUIET TODAY WITH QUIET BLEND AND
ONE THING TO WATCH ALONG THE COAST AND I'M THINKING CAPE IN
PARTICULAR WILL BE OCEAN EFFECT
CLOUDS. PROBABLY LATE ON WEDNESDAY.
THURSDAY WAKING UP TO MORE COLD
AIR. THE PROBLEM IS IT MIGHT BE TOUGH
TO GET THE COLD AIR OUT OF THE
PICTURE IN TIME FOR THE SHOWERS MOVING IN.
RIGHT NOW I KNOW FUTURE CAST
TIMING THEM ARRIVING HERE IN THE EARLY AFTERNOON, I HAVE SOME
OTHER INDICATIONS I HAVE BEEN
LOOKING AT, OTHER FORECAST TOOLS THAT TELLS ME IT IS GOING TO
ARRIVE A LITTLE SOONER.
NOT GOOD IF IT IS STILL COLD, LOOK AT ICING AND EVEN MIXING UP
TO THE MERRIMACK VALLEY AND
WORCESTER HILLS AND BEST BET WILL BE MOUNTAIN SPOTS LIKE THE
BERKSHIRES AND MONADNOCKS AND
GREEN AND WHITE MOUNTAINS. MOSTLY GOING TO BE RAIN WE ARE
DEALING WITH THURSDAY AND FRIDAY
AND WRITE AND BREEZY AND 48 HIGH TOMORROW, GOT MORNING IN THE
30s BOTH WEDNESDAY AS YOU WAKE
UP AND DEVELOPING RAIN I WOULD COUNT ON SHOWERS THROUGH THE
SECOND HALF OF THE DAY HERE ON
THURSDAY SO LUNCHTIME AND WIND PECK UP AND WARMER AT 57Â° AND
MID TO UPPER 50s AND LINGERING

      <description>PER HOUR, POLICE CANINE SEARCHED
THE AREA BUT DIDN'T FIND THEM.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Sara: POLICE LOOKING TO CAPTURE MAN THAT ROBBED A BANK
WITH A GUN AND SHOWING A PICTURE
IN SKELETON MASK. HELD UP CITIZEN'S BANK ON
BROADWAY BEFORE NOON YESTERDAY
AND GOT AWAY ON GREEN BIKE. OFFICERS LATER FOUND MONEY
MARKED WITH RED DYE IN NEARBY
PARKING LOT. &gt;&gt; Gene: DAYS AFTER FOX25
DISCOVERED SEVEN LEVEL THREE SEX
OFFENDERS. FOUND CITY OF LYNN DEALING WITH
SAME ISSUE.
SIX LEVEL THREE SEX OFFENDERS LIVE INSIDE THE ROOMING HOUSE ON
41 LIGHT STREET.
THEY SAY SOME OF THE MEN HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF FORCIBLE RAPE
OF CHILD AND INDECENT ASSAULT
AND BATTERY ON CHILD BUT POLICE SAY THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN BE
DONE.
THEY KEEP AN EYE ON THOSE OFFENDERS BUT LAST YEAR THE
STATE'S HIGHEST COURT THREW OUT
REGULATIONS THAT STOPPED LEVEL THREE AND PARK.
AS WE MENTIONED WE SAW SEVEN
OFFENDERS LIVING IN THIS HOUSE IN DORCHESTER.
RESIDENTS AREN'T HAPPY BUT AGAIN
THE CITY SAYS THERE'S NOTHING THEY CAN DO.
&gt;&gt; Sara: YESTERDAY DURFEE HIGH
SCHOOL WAS ON LOCKDOWN AFTER STUDENT SHARED PHOTO OF GUN ON
SNAPCHAT.
IT WAS CAPTIONED LIVE AT DURFEE AND CAPTIONED AT OR NEAR THE
SCHOOL.
POLICE LEARNED THE 15-YEAR-OLD THAT TOOK THE PICTURE WAS NOT AT
SCHOOL AND ARRESTED HIM AT HOME.
THEY CONFISCATED A BB GUN WHICH WAS SEEN IN THE PHOTO.
&gt;&gt; GET MORE SECURITY GUARDS OR
METAL DETECTER. THIS IS CRAZY.
KIDS GO TO SCHOOL FOR KNOWLEDGE
AND SCARING TO TO SCHOOL. &gt;&gt; STUDENTS ONLY ALLOWED TO
ENTER AT THE DETECTORS.
&gt;&gt; Gene: WIDOW OF STATE TROOPER WANTS CONTROVERSIAL
BALLOT QUESTION HEARD BEFORE IT

HIGH ON POT.
FOX25 CATHERINE PARROTTA LIVE AT STATEHOUSE THIS MORNING AND,
CATHERINE, THAT WOMAN FEATURE IN
NEW ANTIPOT AD TAKING AIM AT RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA.
&gt;&gt; Catherine: PUSHING VOTERS
TO REJECT QUESTION FOUR AND WIFE OF FALLEN STATE TROOPER.
THAT THE STATE TROOPER WAS
TROOPER THOMAS HARDY, HE WAS KILLED BACK IN MARCH WHEN
MEDICAL MARIJUANA PATIENT
SWERVED ACROSS THE PIKE AND SLAMMED INTO THE CRUISER.
PROSECUTORS SAY DAVID WAS
IMPAIRED DRIVER AND WAS IMPAIRED STATE AT THE TIME AND HALF BURNT
MARIJUANA CIGARETTE IN HIS CAR
AT THE TIME OF THE CRASH. WIDOW OF TROOPER CLARDY APPEARS
IN THE AD.
&gt;&gt; THERE'S GOING TO BE MORE ACCIDENTS WEB MORE FATALITIES,
GOING TO HAVE FAMILIES THAT WERE
WITHOUT THE LOVED ONES BECAUSE PUTTING PEOPLE AT RISK AND
HAPPENED TO MY FAMILY, HAPPENED
TO ANYBODY. &gt;&gt; DESPITE THE PUSH BACK THE
BALLOT QUESTION DOES HAVE THE
SUPPORTERS AND MAKING MARIJUANA LEGAL AND TAXING AND REGULATING
IT IS BETTER THAN LEAVING IT
UNDERGROUND. WBUR POLL RELEASED EARLIER THIS
MONTH SHOWED 55% OF
MASSACHUSETTS VOTERS SUPPORT LEGALIZATION AND 40% OPPOSE IT
AND THERE'S EVEN MORE TO THIS
PUSH TO HAVE VOTERS REJECT QUESTION FOUR AS WELL.
IN FACT, TODAY AT 10:30 RIGHT
HERE AT STATEHOUSE THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEWS CONFERENCE WITH AAA
LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL AND
THEY ARE DOING NO ON FOUR PRESS CONFERENCE TODAY TO CONVINCE
VOTERS NOT TO VOTE FOR THIS AND
EXPLAIN MORE NEXT HOUR. FOR NOW LIVE AT STATEHOUSE,

&gt;&gt; Sara: EARLY VOTING AFTER A
TURNOUT YESTERDAY. MORE THAN 4,000 PEOPLE CAST
BALLOTS YESTERDAY AND FIRST TIME
EVER THAT MASSACHUSETTS OFFERED EARLY VOTING.
THERE WERE LINES AT MANY POLLING
PLACES, INCLUDING THE ONE THAT WE WERE AT IN BOSTON CITY HALL.
INDICATIONS ARE THAT EARLY
VOTERS HERE AND OTHER STATES ARE LEANING DEMOCRATIC WHICH WILL
THEN BE POLITICAL EXPERTS MAKING
GOP NERVOUS. &gt;&gt; A LOT OF REPUBLICANS WORRYING
NOW THAT A LOT OF THEM,
PARTICULARLY ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS, TRADITIONAL
CONSERVATIVES, WON'T EVEN BOTHER
TO GO TO THE POLLS IF THEY THINK THE ELECTION IS ALREADY OVER.
&gt;&gt; Sara: 37 STATES OFFERING
EARLY VOTING AND DO SO IN MASSACHUSETTS UP UNTIL
NOVEMBER 4th.
&gt;&gt; Julie: DRIVE TIME ON 93 SOUTH AND TIP IN TRIPLE DIGITS

CATHERINE.
&gt;&gt; Catherine: BATTLE OVER QUESTION FOUR CONTINUES AND
ACCORDING TO NEW POLL DOES HAVE
VOTER SUPPORT AND NEW PUSH TO REJECT QUESTION FOUR.
&gt;&gt; Catherine: BACK IN MARCH
FATHER OF SIX WHEN MEDICAL MARIJUANA PATIENT SLAMMED INTO
THE CRUISER.
&gt;&gt; VERY UPSET TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW AN ADULT, GROWN
MAN COULD GET BEHIND THE WHEEL
AFTER SMOKING MARIJUANA AND THINKING IT IS OKAY.
&gt;&gt; Catherine: IN IMPAIRED
STATE AND PURCHASED THREE MARIJUANA CIGARETTES IN CRASH
AND ON INLINE -- ONLINE AD.
LATEST PUSH TO URGE VOTERS TO REJECT THE MEASURE WHICH RIGHT
NOW SEEMS TO HAVE SOLID VOTER
SUPPORT AND ACCORDING TO WBUR POLL RELEASED EARLIER THIS MONTH
55% OF VOTERS SUPPORT LEGALIZING
MARIJUANA COMPARED TO 40% THAT ARE AGAINST IT AND MAKING
MARIJUANA LEGAL AND REGULATING
AND TAXING IT BETTER THAN LEAVING IT UNDERGROUND BUT THERE
ARE QUESTIONS HOW MUCH MARIJUANA
WOULD BE TAXED AND SOME LAWMAKERS SAY THEY ARE OPEN TO
HIKING TAX HIGHER THAN WHAT'S ON
THE BALLOT. LAWMAKERS ARE ALSO PROMISING
QUICK ACTION TO PROTECT PUBLIC
SAFETY IF QUESTION FOUR PASSES AMID DATA FROM WASHINGTON
SHOWING INCREASE IN MARIJUANA
IMPAIRED TRAFFIC DEATHS A YEAR AFTER LEGALIZATION THERE AND
CONCERN THAT HITS HOME.
&gt;&gt; IF IT CAN HAPPEN TO MY FAMILY IT CAN HAPPEN TO ANYBODY.
&gt;&gt; Catherine: YOU WILL HEAR
MORE OF THE AD. CATHERINE PARROTTA, FOX25 NEWS.

      <description>I KNOW.
&gt;&gt;&gt; CREATING WIND CHILL AND EVEN
THOUGH YOU'RE SEEING TEMPERATURES RIGHT NOW IN THE
40s AND BOSTON AREA OR THE
UPPER 30s IN A LOT OF THE BURBS, IT FEELS LIKE IT IS
FREEZING OUT THERE IN NORWOOD
AND WORCESTER THIS MORNING. CLOSE TO IT IN LAWRENCE, FEELS
LIKE IT IS ONLY 31 IN PLYMOUTH.
WE GOT A COOL, DRY FORECAST TODAY, NORTHERN NEW ENGLAND
GETTING IMPACTED BY THE FRONT,
THAT'S GOING TO SPILL A COUPLE SNOWFLAKES OUT THAT WAY.
BUT IT IS GOING TO BE TOUGH TO
GET ANYTHING DOWN HERE AND WIND TODAY, WIND GUST 30 MILES PER
HOUR AT TIMES THIS AFTERNOON AND
9:00 A.M. TEMPERATURES WELCOME BACK TO THE 40s AND A LOT OF
SPOTS LIKE NORWOOD AND LAWRENCE
AND FITCHBURG, STILL ONLY 36Â° IN WORCESTER AREA, AND LUNCHTIME
COMES ALONG, MID TO UPPER 40s,
BLEND IN SCATTERED CLOUDS AND TEMPERATURE COMING DOWN A LITTLE
BIT FROM HIGH TEMPERATURES ABOUT
48 IN BOSTON AND BEVERLY, 49Â° IN BEDFORD, 48 FITCHBURG UP TO
NASHUA AND SOUTHEASTERN
MASSACHUSETTS THAT'S MY HOT SPOT AND LOWER 50s.
TONIGHT IT WILL BE CHILLY FOR
ALL OF US. MENTION WORCESTER BECAUSE MOST
OF YOU FREEZING TEMPERATURES
TOMORROW, 36 IN BOSTON, COLD ENOUGH FOR FROST OUTSIDE OF THE
CITY AND GOING TO BE QUITE A BIT
COOLER. HIGH TEMPERATURES TOMORROW AGAIN
FLIRTING WITH THE 50 DEGREE MARK
BUT NOT MAKING IT FOR MOST OF SUCCESS THEN ON THURSDAY MY
CONCERN IS THAT WE STILL GOT
COLD AIR IN PLACE AS NEXT WEATHER MAKER MOVES TOWARD US.
IF IT ARRIVES EARLY ENOUGH IN
THE MORNING WE COULD END UP WITH A LITTLE BIT OF ICY MIX HERE
INTO CENTRAL MASS OR MERRIMACK
VALLEY AND SOUTHERN NEW HAMPSHIRE.
THE BEST SNOW CHANCES WILL BE
OUT ACROSS THE BERKSHIRES AND INTO THE MOUNTAINS, EVEN
MONADNOCKS COULD SEE A LITTLE
BIT OF SNOW OUT THERE, BUT MAIN CONCERN REALLY BE SOME PATCHY
INLAND ICE IN THE MORNING AS
WELL AS HEAVY RAIN AS WE TRANSITION INTO THE AFTERNOON
THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY.
BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY LEADS DOWN -- LEAVES DOWN RIGHT NOW
MAKE SURE DRAINS ARE CLEAR AND
DON'T WANT ANY FLOODING ISSUES BECAUSE LEAVES CLOGGING UP
DRAINS.
NEXT MORNINGS IN THE 30s, THURSDAY NIGHT TO FRIDAY RAIN,
FRIDAY AFTERNOON DRIES OUT AND
50s BACK ON TAP, 50s OVER THE WEEKEND WITH SLIGHT RAIN
CHANCES BOTH DAYS.
SARA? &gt;&gt; Sara: ALL RIGHT.
SO THIS ADORABLE BABY IS TRULY A
MEDICAL MIRACLE. THE RARE CONDITION THAT LED TO
DOUBLE BIRTH.
BUT FIRST KEEP EYE OUT FOR MICK JAGGER.

CLEARED.
NEW ACCIDENT ON ROUTE 3 APPROACHING THE BRAINTREE SPLIT.
AS WE SHIFT NORTH OF THE PIKE
ANOTHER ACCIDENT THIS ONE BRAND-NEW ON 128 SOUTHBOUND

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; OPPONENTS OF THE MOVEMENT
TO LEGALIZE MARIJUANA IS TRYING
A NEW APPROACH TO SQUASH THE BALLOT QUESTION.
ALL STARTS WITH AN AD OF THE
WIDOW OF A STATE TROOPER OF A DRIVER ALLEGEDLY HIGH ON POT.
FOX25'S CATHERINE PARROTTA IS
LIVE AT THE STATEHOUSE WITH THE NEW EMOTIONAL AD, CATHERINE.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: RIGHT NOW TWO
WEEKS UNTIL ELECTION DAY AND THE BATTLE CONTINUES TO BREW
OVER QUESTION 4.
THERE IS SOME SUPPORT FROM MASSACHUSETTS VOTERS; HOWEVER,
THERE IS ALSO THIS NEW PUSH FOR
VOTERS TO REJECT QUESTION 4. IN THE FACE OF THAT NEW PUSH TO
REJECT IN MEASURE COMES FROM
THE WIFE OF A FALLEN STATE TROOPER THOMAS CLARDY.
BACK IN MARCH, TROOPER CLARDY
WAS KILLED WHEN A MEDICAL MARIJUANA PATIENT CROSSED THE
PIKE AND SLAMMED INTO HIS
CRUISERS. HE WAS IN AN IMPAIRED STATE AND
HAD A HALF-BURNED MARIJUANA
CIGARETTE IN HIS CAR THE TIME OF THE CRASH.
RAI SA CLARDY APPEARS IN A NEW
ON-LINE AD URGING VOTERS TO DEFEAT AMENDMENT 4.
&gt;&gt; THERE WILL BE MORE ACCIDENTS
AND FATALITIES. FAMILIES WITHOUT THEIR LOVED
ONES BECAUSE WE ARE PUTTING --
WE ARE PUTTING PEOPLE AT RISK. IF IT HAPPENED TO MY FAMILY, IT
CAN HAPPEN TO ANYBODY.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: DESPITE THE PUSH BACK, THE BALLOT QUESTION DOES
HAVE ITS SUPPORTERS.
THEIR ARGUMENT IS MAKING MARIJUANA LEGAL AND TAXING AND
REGULATING IS BETTER THAN
LEAVING IT UNDERGROUND. A POLL RELEASED EARLIER THIS
MONTH SHOW 55% OF MASSACHUSETTS
VOTERS SUPPORT LEGALIZATION AND 40% OPPOSE IT.
IN ADDITION TO THAT EMOTIONAL
AD THAT YOU JUST SAW THAT YOU WILL SEE MORE OF IN ABOUT AN
HOUR, PRACTICAL CONSIDERATION
SURROUNDING THE LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA AND I WILL EXPLAIN
THAT COMING UP IN AN HOUR AS
WELL.</description>

      <description>LIVE AT THE STATE HOUSE,
CATHERINE PARROTTA, FOX25 NEWS.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 6:49 THIS MORNING ON FOX25 MORNING NEWS.
HOPE YOUR TUESDAY MORNING IS
OFF TO A GOOD START. A CHILLY ONE THOUGH.
&gt;&gt; Sara:  A CHILLY ONE AND
GREAT START TO THE MORNING. &gt;&gt; THE FACT THAT WE HAVE THE
SUN OUT THERE THIS MORNING JUST
AFTER 7 A.M. &gt;&gt; Gene:  AT SOME POINT.
&gt;&gt; EVENTUALLY THE SUN WILL COME
UP. AND UNTIL THEN, GET READY FOR
COOL, BREEZY MORNING.
WINDS AROUND 10 MILES PER HOUR. ANY AMOUNT OF WIND ON TOP OF
THE COLD WILL CREATE THESE WIND
CHILLS. RIGHT NOW WIND CHILLS THAT ARE
MOSTLY IN THE 30s.
LOWER 30s AT THAT THE. FEELS LIKE IT IS FREEZING IN
NORWOOD AND BEDFORD AND
WORCESTER AS YOU WAKE UP THIS MORNING.
BOSTON IT FEELS LIKE UPPER 30s.
SO JUST WANT YOU TO BE READY FOR WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO
ENCOUNTER AS YOU STEP OUT THE
DOOR. KEEPING THINGS DRY AND COOL
TODAY.
WE HAVE THIS DISTURBANCE THAT WILL STIR UP A COUPLE OF
SNOWFLAKES IN NORTHERN NEW
ENGLAND. A DRY FORECAST HERE AND WE WILL
BREAK IT DOWN HOUR BY HOUR WITH
FUTURE CAST. SUNSHINE HERE.
PLAIN OL' SUNSHINE AT 8 A.M.
AND TEMPERATURES GENERALLY IN THE 30s HERE PLAIN TEMPERATURES
NOT WIND CHILLS.
BY THE TIME WE HIT NOONTIME MID- TO UPPER 40s AND START TO
GET SOME WISPS OF WHITE ON THE
MAP. SCATTERED CLOUDS BLENDING IN
AND ALSO INCREASING WIND THIS
AFTERNOON, GUSTS AROUND 30 MILES PER HOUR.
AT 5 P.M., WE ARE COMING DOWN A
COUPLE OF DEGREES FROM OUR HIGH OF 48 IN BOSTON AND BEVERLY AND
LAWRENCE.
48 INTO NASHUA, NEW HAMPSHIRE. LOWER 40s IN WORCESTER MY COLD
SPOT AGAIN.
MY HOT SPOT SOUTHEASTERN MASS A COUPLE OF 50s.
NOT TOO MANY TODAY BUT THE
HOPES OF GETTING A COUPLE OF YOU OUT INTO THE 50s.
TEMPERATURES WILL BE FREEZING
IN MOST OF THE SUBURBS. THE EXCEPTIONS BOSTON AS WELL
AS THE IMMEDIATE COASTLINE HERE
FOR THE SOUTH SHORE AND THE CAPE WHERE WE ARE STILL FACING
THE POTENTIAL OF SOME FROST
EVEN IN THESE LOCATIONS. HIGHS TOMORROW UPPER 40s AGAIN.
THE REAL CHANGE IS COMING THIS
WAY ONCE WE HIT THURSDAY. I AM JUST CONCERNED THERE IS
GOING TO BE A LOT OF LINGERING
COLD AIR WHEN YOU WAKE UP THURSDAY MORNING.
THE NEXT WEATHER MAKER MOVES IN
COULD BE COLD ENOUGH TO START WITH SNOW IN THE MOUNTAINS AND
A LITTLE ICY MIX INTO THE
WORCESTER HILLS AND MERRIMACK VALLEY AND TRANSITIONS MOSTLY
TO ALL RAIN AS WE GET INTO
THURSDAY AFTERNOON. OVERNIGHT INTO FRIDAY, YOU CAN
SEE THINGS ARE WARMING BACK UP.
UPPER 40s BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON.
UPPER 50s BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON.
AND WE ARE WATCHING FOR SOME PERIODS OF HEAVY RAIN IN THERE.
FRIDAY AFTERNOON DRIES OUT AND
MOSTLY CLOUDY OVER THE WEEKEND WITH A SLIGHT RISK OF RAIN ON
BOTH DAYS.
JULIE GRAUERT UP NOW WEATHER AND TRAFFIC TOGETHER EVERY TEN
MINUTES.
&gt;&gt; Julie:  SHIRI, THINGS ARE STARTING TO SLOW DOWN BY THE
TIME WE CHECKED IN TEN MINUTES
AGO. AS WE SHIFT SLIGHTLY WEST,
HEAVY, STEADY VOLUME ON 24
NORTHBOUND BECAUSE OF AN EARLIER ACCIDENT THAT HAS SINCE
CLEARED, BUT AS YOU HEAD FROM
STOUGHTON TO RANDOLPH, AVERAGE SPEEDS 14 MILES PER HOUR.
SHIFTING NORTH, A NEW ACCIDENT
128  NORTHBOUND AT HIGH STREET IN ROUTE 109.
EXPRESSWAY STILL HEAVY, STEADY
VOLUME AS YOU CAN SEE AND IT WILL STAY THIS WAY THROUGH THE
ENTIRETY OF THE MORNING
COMMUTE. HERE ARE YOUR LIVE DRIVE TIMES.
18 MINUTES ON ROUTE 3 FROM 228
TO THE SPLIT. 29 MINUTES ON 24 TO ACCOUNT FOR
THE RESIDUAL DELAYS.
32 MINUTES ON THE EXPRESSWAY FROM THE BRAINTREE SPLIT TO
COLUMBIA ROAD.
BACK TO YOU.</description>

DOORS AND WINDOWS ON THE BUS.

EMOTIONAL DISTRESS.

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; PARENT ARE OUTRAGED AFTER
THEY CAUGHT AN 18-YEAR-OLD
PLAYING FOOTBALL WITH THEIR CHILDREN.
THE TEEN WAS SUBBED IN OF A
YOUTH FOOTBALL GAME FOR 13 AND 14-YEAR-OLDS.
PARENTS SAY THEY COULD TELL HE
WAS OUT OF PLACE BY HIS FACIAL HAIR AND ARM TATTOOS MOSTLY
HIDDEN UNDER HIS LONG SLEEVES.
THE TEAM FOUNDER SAID THEY HAVE FIRED THE COACH AND THE TEAM
HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM THEIR
LEAGUE. INCREDIBLY THE 18-YEAR-OLD
DIDN'T EVEN HELP MUCH, THE TEAM
LOST 34-9. &gt;&gt; Gene:  WHEN HE DROVE TO THE
GAME THAT WASN'T A WARNING
SIGN.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; A DISTURBING DISCOVERY MADE
INSIDE A GUMBALL-
A MOM SAID HER DAUGHTER PUT IN A QUARTER AND GOT A PLASTIC
CONTAINER WITH PILLS IN RETURN.
DANIEL MILLER HAS MORE WITH THE WARNING THAT MOM WANT TO SEND
OUT TO ALL PARENTS.
&gt;&gt; Daniel:  COURTNEY JONES WANT PARENTS TO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION
TO WHAT THEIR KIDS GET OUT OF
THE VENDING MACHINES. HER 7-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER,
ALISON, RECOVERED FROM A
GUMBALL MACHINE FILLED WITH GUM AND CANDY.
THE MACHINE WAS AT ROCHESTER
PIZZA. AN OUTSIDE COMPANY FILLED THE
MACHINE AND THAT COMPANY IS
UNSURE HOW THE PILLS ENDED UP THERE.
JONES SAID HER DAUGHTER KNEW
NOT TO INGEST THE PILLS, BUT SHE WORRIES OTHER KIDS MAY NOT
KNOW.
&gt;&gt; SHE SAYS I WOULDN'T WANT THAT.
SHE SAID I KNOW THAT IS NOT
CANDY. SHE IS 7.
SHE IS OLD ENOUGH TO KNOW, BUT
HAD SHE BEEN YOUNGER MAYBE SHE WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN.
&gt;&gt; Daniel:  SO THE QUESTION IS
HOW DID THE PILLS GET THERE? THE PIZZA SHOP SAID THEY DON'T
HAVE KEYS TO THE MACHINE.
POLICE ARE INVESTIGATING AND SAY THEY INSPECTED THE BILLS
AND SHADE, COLOR AND IMPRINT
SUGGEST THEY ARE BLOOD PRESSURE MEDICATION.
THE PIZZA SHOP HAS REMOVED THE
MACHINE FROM THE STORE AND THE COMPANY THAT OWNS IS SAY THEY
DON'T KNOW WHERE IT CAME FROM.

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; TWO WEEKS UNTIL ELECTION
DAY AND THE LATEST CNN POLL
SHOW DONALD TRUMP TRAILING HILLARY CLINTON BY 5 POINTS.
AND NEITHER SIDE IS LETTING UP.
FIGHT TOGETHER FINISH TO TRY TO GRAB EVERY VOTE.
FOX25'S TAN DAN JOINS US WITH
THE WAR OF WORDS BETWEEN THE CANDIDATES.
&gt;&gt; Daniel:  TO SAY THINGS ARE
GETTING NASTY ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT.
NASTY WOMAN IS A THEME.
DONALD TRUMP CALLED CLINTON THAT NAME DURING THE LAST
PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE ON
WEDNESDAY. CLINTON SUPPORTERS ARE USING
THAT TERM AS MORE OF A BATTLE
CRY. DURING A VISIT TO SAINT ANTHEM
COLLEGE, SENATOR ELIZABETH
WARREN JOINED CLINTON ON STAGE AND DIDN'T HOLD BACK ON THE
REPUBLICAN NOMINEE.
&gt;&gt; WE NASTY WOMEN ARE GOING TO MARCH OUR NASTY FEET TO CAST
OUR NASTY VOTES TO GET YOU OUT
OF OUR LIVES FOREVER! &gt;&gt; Daniel:  WHILE THE TRUMP
CAMPAIGN IS TAKING ON THE POLLS
THEMSELVES. THE CAMPAIGN IS URGING
SUPPORTERS TO IGNORE THE,
QUOTE, PHONY POLLS. IN FLORIDA YESTERDAY, YOU SEE
HERE TRUMP TOLD A CROWD AT A
ROUNDTABLE THAT THEY ARE SKEWED IN THE DEMOCRATS FAVOR.
&gt;&gt; SO I ACTUALLY THINK WE ARE
WINNING, AND WHAT THEY DO IS SHOW THESE PHONY POLLS WHERE
THEY -- THEY LOOK AT DEMOCRATS
AND IT IS HEAVILY WEIGHTED WITH DEMOCRATS, AND THEY ARE PUT TO
AN POLL WHERE WE ARE NOT
WINNING, AND EVERYBODY SAYS, OH, THEY ARE NOT WINNING.
A HEAVILY WEIGHTED POLL WITH
DEMOCRATS LIKE THE ABC PHONY POLL THAT CAME OUT.
TOTALLY PHONY POLL.
BUT THE POLLS THAT MEAN SOMETHING WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN
ACCURATE OVER THE YEARS WE ARE
LEADING BY TWO NATIONALLY. &gt;&gt; Daniel:  THE CAMPAIGNS ARE
NOT PULLING THEIR EFFORTS OUT
OF YOU ENGLAND. DONALD TRUMP'S SON, ERIC, WILL
BE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.
CHELSEA CLINTON WILL BE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE LATER THIS WEEK.

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; :17 ON A TUESDAY MORNING.
I WAS THINKING THAT OATMEAL
SOUNDS LIKE A REALLY GOOD THING.
SOUNDS WARM DPEENZ GENE-O A
LITTLE COMFORT BREAKFAST FOOD WILL HELP OUT ON A MORNING LIKE
THIS.
&gt;&gt; Shiri:  I HAVE YOU COVERED IF YOU WANT PACKETS OF OATMEAL,
I HAVE EXTRAS.
&gt;&gt; Gene:  DONE. &gt;&gt; Shiri:  OCTOBER THREE
DEGREES ABOVE AVERAGE.
THAT 58 TAKES YOU INTO ACCOUNT THE MORNING LOWS, THE AFTERNOON
HIGHS.
THE WARMEST WE SEEN THIS MONTH. AND COLDEST 42 AND TOMORROW
MORNING THE COLDEST THAT WHICH
HAVE SEEN ALL FALL YET THIS SEASON.
42 IN BOSTON.
32 DEGREES IN NOR WOOD AS WE WAKE UP THIS MORNING.
WORCESTER AT 35.
AND WORCESTER SEEING CLEAR SKIES NOW.
IT IS GOODBYE TO BE A BRIGHT
AND BEAUTIFUL MORNING 37 .
TEMPERATURE-WISE, WE WILL TART
TO SEE IMPROVEMENTS AROUND 8 A.M. WHICH MEANS IN THE NEXT
HOUR.
WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO DOWN ONE OR TWO DEGREES.
BY 10 A.M., UPPER 30s AND 40s
WITH EXTRA CLOUDS FOR THIS AFTERNOON.
I DON'T EXAMINE IT TO BE
OVERCAST. IT WILL RUN PARTLY SUNNY WITH A
HIGH OF 43 IN BOSTON.
48 IN LAWRENCE, IPSWICH AND BOSTON.
PLYMOUTH TODAY 50 DEGREES.
51 HYANNIS. LOOKS LIKE AREAS SOUTH OF
BOSTON WILL RULE TODAY AND BE
THOSE HOT SPOTS. NORTH OF BOSTON TOUGH TO GET TO
50 DEGREES.
OVERNIGHT TONIGHT THE BIG COOLDOWN.
A LOT OF SPOTS OUTSIDE OF
BOSTON. BOSTON'S LOW 36 DEGREES.
WE WILL HIT THAT AGAIN 7:00
TOMORROW MORNING AND THIS WILL BE A FROSTY START.
EVERYBODY ELSE -- ALL THAT WARM
WEATHER. AND GET THE OATMEAL READY FOR
TOMORROW MORNING AS WELL
BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO BE VERY CHILLY OUT THERE AND HIGHS
REALLY STRUGGLING TO GET UP TO
50. SO MORE OF THOSE UPPER 40s.
FUTURE CAST FOR THE DAY AHEAD.
KIND OF QUIET OUT THERE AND A CUP OF SCATTERED CLOUDS POPPING
UP.
STILL BREEZY WITH WINDS GUSTING AS HIGH AS 30 MILES PER HOUR
THIS AFTERNOON.
THE WINDS CALM DOWN TONIGHT. WE START OFF VERY CHILLY
TOMORROW MORNING BUT THEN WITH
A SLIGHT SHIFT IN OUR WINDS TOMORROW, WE COULD HAVE A
SITUATION WHERE WE ARE TRACKING
SOME OCEAN EFFECT CLOUDS. WE WILL BE WATCHING FOR EXTRA
CLOUDS AT THE COAST AND
ESPECIALLY THE CAPE WITH ANOTHER ROUND OF MOSTLY SUNNY
SKIES INLAND AND THE NEXT
WEATHER SYSTEM. AND THURSDAY MORNING, LOOKING
AT NEW INFORMATION.
LOOKS LIKE THAT MORNING COMMUTE IS GOING TO BE DRY WITH
INCREASING CLOUDS, BUT IT DOES
START COLD. THAT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF
THE RAIN AND THE PRECIPITATION
ARRIVES BEFORE WE SCOUR OUT THOSE 30s IN THE COOLER
TEMPERATURES, WE COULD HAVE A
LITTLE PERIOD HERE WITH ICY CONDITIONS INTO THE WORCESTER
HILLS, THE MERRIMACK RALEIGH.
AND THE MOUNTAINS SEEING KNOW. EASTERN MASS.
WE ARE TALKING RAIN AS WE GET
INTO THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY
MORNING.
A PERIOD OF HEAVY RAIN. THE NEXT THREE DAYS THE
COLDEST.
HIGHS IN THE UPPER 40s. 57 ABOUT WITH THAT MORK RAIN ON
FRIDAY.
IT TURNS BREEZY AGAIN. 50s WITH BOTH DAYS.
BEST CHANCE OF SHOWERS ON
SATURDAY.</description>

WENT TO THE SUV FOR HER CAMERA. AND THEN THE SUV WAS DOWN GONE.
DOWN THE EMBANKMENT 75 FEET
INTO THE EXETER RIVER. &gt;&gt; I AM GRATEFUL THAT SHE WAS
FINE AND WASN'T IN THE CAR.
IT LUNGED FORWARD AND I DIDN'T WANT TO GET DPRAINGED DOWN WITH
IT.

SHE IS LUCKY SHE GOT OUT WHEN

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; WELL, OPPONENTS OF MOVEMENT
TO LEGALIZE MARIJUANA ARE
TRYING A NEW APPROACH TO SQUASH THE BALLOT QUESTION.
ALL STARTS WITH THE AD FEATURES
THE WIDOW OF A STATE TROOPER KILLED WHILE ALLEGEDLY HIGH ON
POT.
CATHERINE PARROTTA IS LIVE AT THE STATEHOUSE WITH A NEW
EMOTIONAL AD, CATHERINE.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: YEAH, ELECTION DAY IS TWO WEEKS AWAY FROM TODAY
BUT STILL A BATTLE BREWING OVER
QUESTION 4. A NEW POLL SHOW THAT THE
MAJORITY OF MASSACHUSETTS
VOTERS ARE IN FAVOR OF LEGALIZING MARIJUANA AND
HOWEVER, THERE IS A NEW PUSH
AGAINST IT. &gt;&gt; OBVIOUSLY CHANGE MIND LIFE
GREATLY.
MY HUSBAND IS NOT HERE ANYMORE. &gt;&gt; Reporter: RAISA CLARDY THE
WIDOW OF STATE TROOPER THOMAS
CLARDY. A MARIJUANA -- MEDICAL
MARIJUANA PATIENT SWERVED AND
CROSSED INTO HIS CRUISER. &gt;&gt; I WAS UPSET HOW AN ADULT, A
GROWN MAN COULD GET BEHIND THE
WHEEL AFTER SMOKING MARIJUANA AROUND THINKING THAT IT WAS
OKAY.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: PROSECUTORS SAY DAVID NJUNGA WAS IN AN IMPAIRED
STATE AND PURCHASED THREE
MARIJUANA CIGARETTES BEFORE THE CRASH.
RAISA CLARDY IS IN A ONLINE AD.
ACCORDING TO A WBUR POLL RELEASED EARLIER 55% OF VOTERS
SUPPORT LEGALIZING MARIJUANA
COMPARED TO 44% THAT ARE AGAINST IT.
THOSE BACK THE MEASURE SAYING
MAKING PAR BEEN THAT LEGAL IS BETTER THAN LEAVING IT
UNDERGROUND, BUT QUESTIONS OF
HOW MUCH MARIJUANA WILL BE TAXED.
SOME LAWMAKERS ARE OPEN TO
HIKING THE TAX HIGHER THAN WHAT IS ON THE BALLOT.
LAWMAKERS ARE PROMISING QUICK
ACTION TO PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY IF AMENDMENT 4  PASSES.
A CONCERN THAT HITS HOME FOR
RAISA CLARDY. &gt;&gt; IF IT CAN HAPPEN TO MY
HUSBAND, IT CAN HAPPEN TO
ANYBODY. &gt;&gt; Reporter: THAT AD DOES
APPEAR ONLINE ONLY AT THIS
TIME. WE WILL HAVE MORE OF THAT AD
COMING UP IN JUST A AN HOUR.
LIVE AT THE STATEHOUSE,</description>

      <description>VOTING.
&gt;&gt;&gt; AND 5  :48 RIGHT NOW ON
TUESDAY MORNING. GENE'S FAVORITE DAY AND SUPER
COOL IN THE 40s RIGHT NOW.
&gt;&gt; Gene:  A LOT OF THIS GOING ON THIS MORNING.
&gt;&gt; Shiri:  I EXPECT A LOT OF
THAT AT THE BUS STOP. &gt;&gt; Gene:  THOSE OF HOUSE DON'T
WEAR GLOVES.
&gt;&gt; Shiri:  GLOVES ARE A GREAT IDEA AND MAYBE HATS TOO SO YOU
DON'T RUB THE EARS AS WELL.
THE WIND CHILLS THAT ADDS INSULT TO INJURY.
WINDS BETWEEN 10 AND 15 MILES
PER HOUR. EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T HAVE GUSTY
CONDITIONS YET, IT IS
CONTRIBUTING TO FEELS-LIKE TEMPERATURE A LITTLE BIT COOLER
.
IN THE 40s IN BOSTON AND FEELS LIKE 36.
29 IN WORCESTER.
YOU CAN PULL YOU HAVE THE FOX25 WEATHER APP AND UNDER THE
TEMPERATURE IN YOUR TOWN IS
ACTUALLY GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT IT FEELS LIKE AS YOU LEAVE THE
HOUSE.
ANYHOW, DRY CONDITIONS HERE AND NORTHERN NEW ENGLAND WILL GET A
CUP OF SNOWFLAKES FROM THAT
FRONT. THAT FRONT ISN'T THE BIG PLAYER
IN ITS OWN FORECAST.
ANOTHER SYSTEM THAT COMES INTO PLAY FOR LATE NEXT WEEK.
FOR TODAY, MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES.
SUN COMING UP AT 7 A.M. TEMPERATURES HITTING ROCK
BOTTOM IN THE MID-30s.
BOSTON AT 40 DEGREES AT 7:00. BY 9 A.M., THE WARM-UP UNDER
WAY BECAUSE WE ARE BACK IN THE
40s IN MOST TOWNS AND CITIES. PAUSE THINGS UP AT NOONTIME
JUST TO POINT OUT UPPER 40s AND
WE HAVE SCATTERED CLOUDS THAT START TO POP IN MIXED WITH THE
SUNSHINE.
AND THIS PARTLY SUNNY, EVEN BREEZY FORECAST THIS AFTERNOON
WITH TEMPERATURES HERE AS YOU
HEAD HOME FROM WORK COMING DOWN A CUP OF DEGREES FROM THE HIGH
TEMPERATURES OF 49 IN BOSTON.
48 IN BEVERLY. 50 DEGREES OVER SOUTHEASTERN
MASSACHUSETTS.
THE HOT SPOT TODAY AND ONLY 43 IN WORCESTER.
TONIGHT WILL BE A COLD ONE WITH
30s ON THE MAP. MOST TOWNS AND CITY WAKING UP
TO FREEZE TEMPERATURES.
BOSTON AT 36. IT WILL BE FROSTY FOR YOU FROM
THERETO WARM-UP BACK IN THE
UPPER 40s. I KNOW WE ARE NOT GETTING MUCH
OF A WARM-UP IN THE NEXT COUPLE
OF DAYS. THE COLD AIR PLANTED IN PLACE.
STILL IF YOU WAKE UP THURSDAY
MORNING. THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IF THIS
PRECIPITATIONS COME IN AND COLD
OUT THERE. WE ARE JUST NOT DEALING WITH
THE SNOW AND MIX INTO THE
MOUNTAINS. WE COULD BE DEALING WITH PATCHY
FREEZING RAIN AND ICY SPOTS ON
OUR OWN LOCAL ROADWAY THERE IS THURSDAY MORNING OR EVEN DURING
THE EARLY AFTERNOON.
SO WE WILL BE TRACKING SOME MOUNTAIN SNOW, YES, BUT INLAND
ICE IS WHAT HAS ME WORRY THE
MOST AND THEN PERIODS OF HEAVY RAIN THURSDAY AND FRIDAY
MORNING.
FRIDAY A LITTLE WARM-UP AT 57. 50s OVER THE WEEKEND AS WELL.
MOSTLY CLOUDY WITH A SLIGHT
CHANCE OF SHOWERS. JULIE GRAUERT IS UP NOW WITH
LIVE DRIVE TIME TRAFFIC.
HOW IS IT LOOKING OUT THERE. &gt;&gt; I THINK SO FAR SO GOOD.
WHAT I PLANTED ON THE
EXPRESSWAY MOVING ALONG ROUTE 3 JUST FINE FOR THE SOUTH SHORE
COMMUTERS PAST ROUTE 18 AND TO
THE BRAINTREE SPLIT. 24 AND 9 5 ARE CLEAR.
95 WILL START TO SLOW DOWN
CLOSER TO 6:30 IN THAT WE WILL BOW AS YOU APPROACH 128.
STARTING TO SEE THINGS PICK UP
JUST SLIGHTLY. THE LIVE DRIVE TIMES.
13 MINUTES ON ROUTE 3 AS YOU
APPROACH THE SPLIT. 17 MINUTES ON 24 HEADED TOWARD
128.
14 MINUTES ON THE EXPRESSWAY FROM THE BRAINTREE SPLIT TO
COLUMBIA ROAD.
BACK TO YOU.</description>

      <description>GOT A PLASTIC CONTAIN WE ARE
PILLS IN RETURN.
IT IS SPARKING A POLICE INVESTIGATION AND DANIEL MILLER
MASS MORE ON THE MESSAGE THAT
MOM WANTS TO SEND TO ALL PARENT.
&gt;&gt; PAY CLOSE ATTENTION WHAT
COMES OUT OF VENDING MACHINES. THOSE ARE THE PILLS THAT HER
7-YEAR-OLD GOT FROM OF A
VENDING MACHINE. AT ROCHESTER PIZZA.
AN OUTSIDE COMPANY FILLS THE
MACHINE AND THE COMPANY IS UNSURE HOW THE PILLS TURNED UP.
JONES JUST HOPES IT NEVER
HAPPENS AGAIN. &gt;&gt; I PUT ALL THREE QUARTERS IN.
THE FIRST TWO WERE LITTLE TOYS,
AND THE THIRD ONE WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT I THOUGHT IT WAS
CANDY.
I DIDN'T LET HER HAVE IT. I SAID HOLD ON.
LET ME LOOK AT THIS.
I END TO UP AND REALIZED IT WAS MEDICATION.
&gt;&gt; HER DAUGHTER KNEW NOT TO
INGEST THE PILLS BUT SHE WORRIES THAT OTHERS DID NOT
KNOW.
HOW DID THE PILLS GET THERE. THE PIZZA SHOP SAID THEY DON'T
HAVE DEES TO THE MACHINE.
POLICE ARE INVESTIGATING AND SAID THEY INSPECTED THE PILLS
AND SHAPE, COLOR AND IMPRINTS
SUGGEST THEY ARE BLOOD PRESSURE MEDICATION.
THE PIZZA SHOP REMOVED THE
MACHINE FROM THE STORE AND THE COMPANY THAT OWNS IT DOES NOT
KNOW WHERE IT CAME FROM.

      <description>PRACTICE.
HE SAYS HE LIKES TO SING TO PASS
THE TIME. GO AND WATCH IT BACK AND SEE HOW
HE DID.
PROBLEM IS, ON THIS DAY TRAVIS WAS SINGING IN THE RAIN.
&gt;&gt; OH!
WHAT HAPPENED? &gt;&gt; OH!
&gt;&gt; WHAT HIT HIM?
&gt;&gt; OR DID HE SLIDE OFF THE ROAD? &gt;&gt; OH, MY GOSH.
&gt;&gt; IS THAT SCREAM PART OF THE
SONG? &gt;&gt; IT WAS NOT PART OF THE SONG.
TRAF IS HYDROPLANING.
YOU CAN SEE HIM SPIN AROUND, BUT WE ALL SEE TRAVIS AT THE END.
HE'S LIKE, WHOA, I'M GOOD.
&gt;&gt; OH, MY GOODNESS. &gt;&gt; WOW.
&gt;&gt; SHOWS HOW QUICKLY THINGS CAN
CHANGE ON THE ROAD. &gt;&gt; LET'S FIND OUT MORE ABOUT
THIS INCIDENT, MAYBE EVEN WHAT
HIS PARENTS THOUGHT. TRAVIS JOINING US VIA SKYPE
"RIGHT THIS MINUTE."
HOW ARE YOU DOING? &gt;&gt; GOOD, HOW ARE YOU GUYS?
&gt;&gt; WE'RE GREAT.
HAD TO BE INJURIES AFTER THIS. YOU ROLLED YOUR CAR.
&gt;&gt; ZERO INJURIES, NOT SO MUCH AS
A SCRATCH ON MY ARM. &gt;&gt; NO KIDDING.
YOUR CAR ROLLED, AIRBAGS,
NOTHING WENT OFF. &gt;&gt; SINCE IT WAS A ROLL, ALL THE
DAMAGE HAPPENED TO THE SIDES AND
TOP OF THE CAR AND AIRBAGS ONLY DEPLOY IF YOU HIT THE FRONT END
OF THE CAR.
&gt;&gt; WHEN YOU WATCH IT, HOW DOES IT MAKE YOU FEEL?
&gt;&gt; TERROR A WHILE IT MADE ME
SICK TO MY STOMACH TO WATCH IT. HONESTLY, WATCHED IT SO MANY
TIMES IT'S JUST FUNNY.
&gt;&gt; WHAT WERE YOU SINGING? &gt;&gt; THAT'S A RELIGIOUS GROUP, SO
HE WAS SINGING ABOUT GOD.
&gt;&gt; WHEN YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY SAW THIS VIDEO, WHAT WAS THEIR
REACTION?
&gt;&gt; WELL, MY MOM AND TWO SISTERS WOULDN'T EVEN WATCH IT THE FIRST
DAY.
MY DAD WAS THE ONLY ONE WILLING TO WATCH IT.
HE LAUGHED INSTANTLY.
TYPICALLY DAD REACTION. IT'S BEEN A MONTH AND MY OLDEST
SISTER IS STILL NOT WILLING TO
WATCH IT. &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE PEOPLE SAYING ONLINE
NOW THAT YOU SHARED IT?
&gt;&gt; A LOT OF PEOPLE SEEM TO BE ANGRY WITH ME FOR DRIVING THAT
FAST IN THE RAIN, WHICH IS FAIR.
I'M NEVER GOING TO DRIVE THAT FAST IN THE RAIN AGAIN.
SEEN A LOT OF COMMENTS ABOUT
THAT SCREAM. &gt;&gt; THAT SCREAM, I WANT A
REACTION GIF OF THAT SCREAM.
&gt;&gt; WHAT'S THE DAMAGE DONE TO THE CAR?
&gt;&gt; ZERO MECHANICAL DAMAGE.
THERE WAS DIRT AND LONG GRASS JAMMED IN BETWEEN THE TIRE AND
RIM.
GOT IT CLEANED OUT FOR FREE AND STARTED DRIVING IT THE NEXT DAY.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S GREAT.
GREAT STORY, TRAVIS, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING IT WITH US,
WE APPRECIATE IT.
&gt;&gt; NO PROBLEM. &gt;&gt; SEE YOU, MAN.
&gt;&gt; SOMETIMES YOU JUST CATCH
SOMEBODY DYING. &gt;&gt; OH, YEAH.
&gt;&gt; THAT RIGHT THERE HAS CAUGHT
THE EYE OF THE HUMAN AND IS DOING THE SLOW -- I SEE YOU.
THEN THE STRUT.
HEY, HEY. LOOK AT ME.
&gt;&gt; LOOK AT ME LOOKING AT YOU.
&gt;&gt; OR IS THE DEER JUST LOOKING AT ITS OWN REFLECTION?
&gt;&gt; NO.
IT'S LOOKING AT YOU. THEN IT'S LIKE, WAIT, NOT MY
TYPE.
&gt;&gt; PLAYING HARD TO GET. &gt;&gt; I KNOW.
I'M SURPRISED.
RACCOONS THAT I LIKE. WHY?
THEY ARE IN THEIR NATURAL
HABITAT WHERE THEY SHOULD BE. THEY ARE IN THE WOODS IN CENTRAL
MINNESOTA WHERE THERE IS A LIVE
CAM. &gt;&gt; SO THEY ARE NOT WHERE THEY
ARE SUPPOSED TO BE.
THEY ARE ON A DEER TRAIL STEALING FOOD.
I DON'T CARE.
&gt;&gt; THIS BUCKET'S GOING TO GO POLING FOR RACCOONS.
THERE'S YOUR WARNING.
HERE ARE THE ANTLERS. &gt;&gt; LOOK AT SOME OF THESE JOKERS.
&gt;&gt; FINALLY STARTS EATING.
I'M GOING TO PUT MY HOOVES OUT. &gt;&gt; NEAR THE END, YOU KNOW WHAT,
THAT'S IT.
THE BUFFET IS CLOSED. &gt;&gt; BACHELORETTE PARTIES ARE
SUPPOSED TO BE FUN.
IT'S THE BRIDE TO BE'S LAST TIME TO TURN UP BEFORE SHE TIES THE
KNOT.
IN AUSTRALIA, HER NIGHT TOOK A TURN FOR THE WORSE.
&gt;&gt; WHO'S THAT?
&gt;&gt; HERE YOU SEE HER INTERACTING WITH A MAN.
SHE SUFFERED A BROKEN COLLARBONE
AND WAS KNOCKED UNCONSCIOUS. &gt;&gt; HOW'S IT GET STARTED?
&gt;&gt; LOOKS LIKE IT STARTED INSIDE
THE PLACE THEY WERE AT. AN ARGUMENT STARTED AND NOW YOU
SEE PEOPLE PUSHING AND SHOVING.
TWO OF THE MEN WITH THE OTHER GROUP GOT INVOLVED AND NOW IT'S
ONE BIG BRAWL.
&gt;&gt; LOOK AT THE GUY JUST RAINING PUNCHES.
&gt;&gt; TELL ME THAT GUY GOT IN
SERIOUS TROUBLE. HE'S DECKING EVERYBODY LEFT AND
RIGHT.
&gt;&gt; THIS HAPPENED IN MARCH. THE WOMAN PLED GUILTY TO FIVE
COUNTS OF ASSAULT.
THE OTHER FACES TWO CHARGES, INCLUDING ASSAULT AND BODILY
HARM.
THIS NEXT TAKES PLACE IN SOUTH AFRICA.
YOU SEE A BUNCH OF FOLKS
STANDING THERE IN LINE, A WOMAN AT THE COUNTER HAS HER STROLLER
THERE NEXT TO HER.
PAY ATTENTION TO THE MAN IN GRAY.
HE'S MOVING ABOUT, HAS HIS HANDS
IN HIS POCKETS, HAS A PAMPHLET IN HIS HANDS.
&gt;&gt; ONLY THING HE'S DOING IS
NOT -- HE'S NOT LOOKING AT ANYTHING, HE'S KIND OF UP TO
SOMETHING.
&gt;&gt; GRABS MERCHANDISE OFF THE WALL AND TURNS BACK TO SEE IF
ANYONE'S WATCHING.
HE USES THE PAMPHLET AS A SHIELD AS HE APPROACHES THE STROLLER.
THERE HE GOES.
&gt;&gt; MAMA'S PURSE IS RIGHT THERE, HUH?
&gt;&gt; YES, IT IS, GAYLE.
TAKES THE WALLET AND WALKS OFF LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED.
THEY ARE USING THIS VIDEO TO
REMIND FOLKS TO STAY AWARE AND PAY ATTENTION TO THEIR
SURROUNDINGS, BECAUSE THIS
HAPPENS WAY TOO FREQUENTLY.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt; STAND BY, EVERYONE, FOR THE
"RTM" iPAD MINI GIVEAWAY.
&gt;&gt;&gt; LOUIS HERE IS ONE HECK OF A SLACK LINER.
HE IS SETTING A WORLD RECORD IN
THIS CANYON IN OREGON. &gt;&gt; THE PEOPLE ARE ANCHORING THE
SLACK LINE?
&gt;&gt; THAT IS EXACTLY CORRECT. THEY SAY THAT THE WORLD'S
LONGEST HUMAN ANCHOR HIGH LINE
WAS ABOUT 250 FEET, AND THEY SET IT BACK ON SEPTEMBER 11th.
THIS WAS DONE BY A GROUP OF
PROFESSIONAL HIGH LINERS, SO EVERYBODY REALLY KNOWS WHAT THEY
ARE DOING.
&gt;&gt; GOOD FOR THEM. &gt;&gt; YOU WOULD THINK, RIGHT?
&gt;&gt; YOU SEE LOUIS GETTING ON THE
ROPES, HE KNOWS WHAT'S UP. &gt;&gt; QUITE LITERALLY HAS SOMEONE'S
LIFE IN YOUR HANDS.
&gt;&gt; HE FALLS A COUPLE OF TIMES, BUT EVENTUALLY HE DOES MAKE IT
ALL THE WAY ACROSS.
AND THEY ARE ALL CHEERING HIM ON.
HE LOOKS SUPER HAPPY, BUT WHY
DON'T WE HAVE HIM SLIDE OUT TO THE MIDDLE OF THE LINE AND ONCE
HE'S DO YOU THINK THERE, WE'RE
GOING TO COUNT TO THREE. IT'S GOING TO BOUNCE HIM AND
HE'S GOING TO FLY AND IT'S GOING
TO BE AWESOME. IT SOUNDED LIKE A GREAT IDEA
UNTIL THEY TRIED IT.
&gt;&gt; THREE, TWO, ONE, GO! &gt;&gt; HE FALLS, BUT HE LOOKS LIKE
HE'S INJURED.
AND HE MANAGES TO HUSTLE THROUGH HIS PAIN.
HE GETS BACK UP.
&gt;&gt; WOW. &gt;&gt; BUT AS HE'S COMING BACK, YOU
SEE THE BLOOD ON HIS ELBOW.
&gt;&gt; THAT BIT HARD. &gt;&gt; SO HARD IT MADE HIM CRY.
I THINK HE WAS SCARED.
&gt;&gt; DIDN'T WANT TO CRY. &gt;&gt; YOU GUYS ARE MY FRIENDS.
&gt;&gt; EITHER WAY, HE'S GOING TO BE
OKAY AND EVERYBODY IS DEEMED TO</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; THIS VIDEO IS ABSOLUTELY
PRECIOUS.
&gt;&gt; LITTLE BABY. &gt;&gt; REALLY LITTLE BABY.
&gt;&gt; THEY ARE CALLING HER THE
MIRACLE TINY BABY. HER NAME IS MACY AND SHE WAS
BORN AT 25 WEEKS.
&gt;&gt; HOLY COW! &gt;&gt; YEAH, SHE WEIGHED 1.2 POUNDS.
HER MOM, KAREN, WAS AT ONE OF
HER APPOINTMENTS WHEN THEY FOUND SHE HAD PRECLAFRPS YA AND SHE
HAD TO HAVE THE BABY BY
C-SECTION IMMEDIATELY. THE VIDEO SHOWCASES HER
INTERACTING WITH HER DAD.
THIS FAMILY HAS ACTUALLY HAD TWO MIRACLES HAPPEN, BECAUSE THE
FATHER WAS IN A VERY BAD
MOTORCYCLE ACCIDENT AND HE ALSO LIVED.
MACY IS NOW EIGHT MONTHS OLD AND
SHE'S NICE AND HEALTHY. INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, THOUGH,
SHE WEIGHS WHAT A NORMAL NEWBORN
BABY WOULD WEIGH. THE VIDEO IS GOING VIRAL AND HER
STORY IS MAKING HEADLINES
BECAUSE SHE IS SUCH A MIRACLE BABY.
IN ADDITION TO THAT, HER MOM HAS
STARTED A FUNDRAISING CAMPAIGN FOR THE HOSPITAL THAT HELPED
THEM OUT.
THIS NEXT VIDEO ALSO TAKES PLACE FOR THE HOSPITAL.
SHE'S JUST HAD SURGERY, THIS IS
HER BROTHER. HE'S BEEN IN JAPAN FOR THE LAST
TWO AND A HALF YEARS.
AS THEY GO INTO HER ROOM, YOU HEAR HER TALKING.
SUDDENLY A VOICE TELLS HER TO BE
QUIET. &gt;&gt; SHUSH.
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE SO UNDER THE INFLUENCE
OF THE ANESTHETICS. &gt;&gt; AM I IMAGINING THIS?
&gt;&gt; THAT'S MY BROTHER.
&gt;&gt; PULLED OUT ALL THE STOPS AND JACKED UP THE BUDGET FOR THIS
PROMO FOR SUPER CHEAP AUTO,
BECAUSE THIS IS IN REALLY AWESOME COMMERCIAL FOR THE AUTO
PARTS DEALER IN AUSTRALIA.
THEY ARE FLYING IN RACE TRUCKS, DROPPING THEM ON THE BEACH OF
QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA, AND
LETTING THEM LOOSE IN THE CITY. &gt;&gt; NOTHING SUPER CHEAP ABOUT
THIS COMMERCIAL.
&gt;&gt; NOT AT ALL. I DON'T THINK I'M BEING FOOLED
BY SPECIAL EFFECTS HERE.
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY REALLY DID FLY IN TRUCKS LATCHED TO
HELICOPTERS HERE.
I COULD BE MISTAKEN, BUT I DON'T THINK SO.
&gt;&gt; IT LOOKS LIKE THERE WERE
CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF IT THAT WERE FOR REAL, REAL.
&gt;&gt; THIS WHOLE VIDEO IS JUST SO
MUCH FUN WATCHING THESE TRUCKS STORM THROUGH THE CITY.
FIRST THEY START OFF ON THE
BEACH, THEN THEY TRANSITION TO THE PORT.
SLOW DOWN THERE, STOP!
&gt;&gt; THEY ARE NOT STREET LEGAL HERE.
THAT'S WHY THEY ARE KEEPING THEM
ON THE BEACH. &gt;&gt; MAD MAX OUT THERE.
&gt;&gt; BOOM.
&gt;&gt; WAHOO! &gt;&gt; EXPLOSION.
&gt;&gt; OUT OF THE PORT, INTO THE
CITY. BURNED RUBBER SMOKING IT UP.
PERFECT SHOT RIGHT HERE AS THEY
WRAP AROUND THE CAMERA GUY. &gt;&gt; THERE YOU GO.
&gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR OIL, GO
TO SUPER CHEAP AUTO.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; IN THIS VERY CONTROVERSIAL
VIDEO FROM ARGENTINA, THE
YOUNGER SISTER OF THE TWINS IS INSIDE THE PINATA AND THE TWO
TWIN SISTERS ARE USING THE HANDS
OF THE MINION TO KIND OF HIT IT. &gt;&gt; MY INITIAL REACTION IS TO
GIGGLE AT THIS, BECAUSE A LITTLE
GIRL INSIDE A MINION'S COSTUME IS KIND OF FUNNY.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S THE THING.
THEIR MOTHER THOUGHT IT WAS HILARIOUS, TOO.
&gt;&gt; WHERE'S THE CONTROVERSY?
&gt;&gt; THE VIDEO WAS POSTED BY CYNTHIA HERNANDEZ, A WIFE OF A
VERY FAMOUS SOCCER PLAYER IN
ARGENTINA. SHE HAS A TON OF FOLLOWERS AND
SHARED THIS WITH THE DESCRIPTION
OF HERE'S THE VENGEANCE OF ONE OF HER DAUGHTERS AND SAYS, THEY
ARE AGGRESSIVE, THEY ARE BEING
MISTREATED. SHE WAS POSTING IT TRYING TO BE
FUNNY, BEING SARCASTIC.
&gt;&gt; YOU SEE, LONG AGO I DISCOVERED SARCASM DOES NOT
COMMUNICATE THROUGH TEXT.
&gt;&gt; PEOPLE ARE TAKING THIS COMPLETELY SERIOUSLY.
&gt;&gt; THIS ACTUALLY DID BUG ME,
BECAUSE WHEN THE LITTLE GIRL TAKES IT OFF, HER SISTERS
CONTINUE HITTING HER OVER THE
HEAD WITH THE HANDS. COULD THEY BE LEARNING THAT IT'S
OKAY TO BE PHYSICALLY
AGGRESSIVE? &gt;&gt; COME ON.
&gt;&gt; THEY DON'T EVEN LOOK LIKE
THEY ARE GRIMACING. &gt;&gt; IF THE LITTLE GIRL WAS
HYSTERICAL AND CRYING AND UPSET
AND SHAKEN, YEAH, MOM SHOULD HAVE STEPPED IN AND SAID COOL IT
OFF.
&gt;&gt; WHAT'S ENRAGING PEOPLE IS THE ADULTS WERE EGGING THIS ON.
&gt;&gt; NO ONE KNOWS THEIR KIDS AND
THE FAMILY DYNAMIC BETTER THAN THE PARENTS THAT ARE IN THE
ROOM.
&gt;&gt; JESSICA ALWAYS HAS CHEESE ON THE BRAIN.
CAN YOU GUESS WHAT SHE'S SERVING
UP THIS HALLOWEEN? BRAINS!
BRAINS!
&gt;&gt; SORRY, GUYS, I GET A LITTLE WEIRD, BUT I FOUND SOMETHING TO
SOLVE THAT, A CHEESE BALL
RECIPE, A BRAIN CHEESE BALL RECIPE.
&gt;&gt; BRAINS?
NOT BREAD? &gt;&gt; NOPE.
CHEESE BRAIN.
IT'S A CHEESE BALL RECIPE. FIRST IS MIX UP FETA AND CREAM
CHEESE IN THE PROCESSER.
&gt;&gt; YOU HAD ME AT FETA. &gt;&gt; IT'S ALREADY GOTTEN GOOD,
RIGHT?
ONCE YOU MIX THE CHEESES TOGETHER, REFRIGERATE.
UP NEXT, CREAM CHEESE, PESTO,
PARMESAN. &gt;&gt; BELONGS IN YOUR BELLY.
ONCE THAT'S BLENDED, ADD SOME
TOASTED PINE NUTS. &gt;&gt; PINE NUTS.
&gt;&gt; REFRIGERATE THAT, AS WELL.
NOW COMES ROASTED TOMATOES AND BALSAMIC VINEGAR.
NOW PLATE IT ALL.
FORM THE CHEESE BALL, THEN TAKE YOUR FETA MIX.
&gt;&gt; NOW I SEE WHERE THIS IS
GETTING BRAINY. &gt;&gt; WOULDN'T BE A HALLOWEEN
CHEESE BALL WITHOUT THE BLOOD.
&gt;&gt; THESY, LOOK AT THAT. &gt;&gt; PRETTY GOOD.
KIND OF ALL BLENDS TOGETHER MORE
THAN WE SAW ON THE VIDEO. &gt;&gt; YEAH, TASTES GOOD, GOOD FOR
YOUR HALLOWEEN PARTY.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S REALLY TASTY. YOU HAVE TWO FLAVORS.
CREAM CHEESE ON THE TOP AND
GARLIC ON THE BOTTOM. &gt;&gt; DON'T SKIP ON THE TOMATO JAM.
THAT REALLY GIVES IT THE ACCENT
IT NEEDS. &gt;&gt; THAT'S AWESOME.
&gt;&gt; HOW LONG DOES THIS TAKE
TOTAL? &gt;&gt; NOT THAT LONG, YOU DON'T EVEN
HAVE TO WATCH IT IN BETWEEN.
YOU HAVE TO LET IT SIT IN THE FRIDGE FOR AN HOUR, BUT ONCE
IT'S SET, YOU'RE GOOD TO GO.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS A GAME CHANGER. &gt;&gt; IT'S REALLY GOOD.
IF YOU WANT TO MAKE THIS AT
HOME, GO TO RIGHTTHISMINUTE.COM, CLICK ON TV SHOW, OR GO TO OUR
MOBILE APP.

AT EARLY AGE THESE DAYS. IN ORDER TO KEEP UP WITH THE
TECHNOLOGY AND THE CHANGING
TIMES, THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS IS OUT TODAY WITH
UPDATED RECOMMENDATIONS FOR
DIGITAL USE BY YOUNG CHILDREN. THEY VARY BY AGE.
THE GROUP NOW ADVISES THAT
CHILDREN UNDER 18 MONTHS SEE SCREENS ONLY IN THE FORM OF
VIDEO CHATTING, FACE TIME AND
SKYPE. CHILDREN 18 MONTHS TO TWO YEARS
OLD SHOULD BE SHOWN MEDIA ONLY
TOGETHER WITH AN ADULT. CHILDREN AGES TWO TO FIVE SHOULD
WATCH 1 HOUR OR LESS.
NOW, THERE'S A CAVEAT. PEDIATRICIANS SAY KIDS SHOULD
PUT DOWN DEVICES LONG ENOUGH TO
SLEEP, EXERCISE, EAT, MAKE SURE THEY ENGAGE IN HEALTHY AC35
OFFLINE LIVES.
THE ACADEMY OF PETE AT TRICKS USED TO RECOMMEND THAT CHILDREN
UNDER TWO NOT SEE ANY SCREENS AT
ALL AND THEN YOUNGER KIDS TO TEENS ONLY USE ABOUT AN HOUR A
DAY, HOUR OR TWO-A-DAY AND
IMAGINE HOW THAT WENT OVER. REPORTING LIVE IN WASHINGTON,

&gt;&gt; Gene: HAPPENING NOW POLICE ARE STEPPING UP SECURITY AT
LAWRENCE SCHOOLS THIS MORNING.
THE EXTRA PATROLS COME AFTER A SHOCKING CRIME INVOLVING A
13-YEAR-OLD STUDENT.
&gt;&gt; Sara: POLICE SAY THE GIRL WAS WALKING TO CLASS YESTERDAY
WHEN SHE WAS KIDNAPPED AND
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED. FOX25 MICHAEL HENRICH IS LIVE
OUTSIDE OF HER SCHOOL THIS
MORNING WHERE THE COURAGEOUS TEEN WAS ABLE TO PROVIDE POLICE
WITH A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF
HER ATTACKER AND HIS APARTMENT, MICHAEL.
&gt;&gt; Michael: SHE WAS ONLY TWO
BLOCKS AWAY FROM SCHOOL AND SHE WALKED HERE TO THE SOUTH
LAWRENCE EAST EDUCATIONAL
COMPLEX WHEN POLICE SAY SHE WAS ABDUCTED, AND SHE DID GIVE
DETAILED INFORMATION TO HELP HIS
CAPTURE COME QUICKLY, AND THIS MORNING LAWRENCE POLICE, YOU CAN
SEE, HAVE STEPPED UP PATROLS,
JUST WITHIN THE LAST 20 MINUTES. I SEE FOUR OR FIVE POLICE
CRUISERS JUST IN MY LINE OF SITE
HERE. THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERY KID
GETS TO SCHOOL SAFELY THIS
MORNING. &gt;&gt; CRIME UNSPEAKABLE AND WE HAVE
TO DO ALL THAT'S POSSIBLE TO
PROTECT AGAINST THE MOST VULNERABLE CITIZENS.
&gt;&gt; Michael: ANGEL MATEO
ARRESTED HOURS AFTER SHE GRABBED A 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL AS SHE WALKED
TO SCHOOL THURSDAY MORNING.
DRAGGED HER INTO SECOND FLOOR PHILLIPS STREET APARTMENT AND
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED HER OVER A
2-HOUR PERIOD. THE YOUNG VICTIM TOLD POLICE SHE
WAS THEN ALLOWED TO LEAVE AND
REPORTED WHAT HAPPENED TO HER SCHOOL.
&gt;&gt; ALL OF A SUDDEN ALL OF THESE
COPS SHOWED UP AND DETECTIVES AND A LITTLE AFTER 10:00.
&gt;&gt; Michael: THE NEIGHBOR THAT
WITNESSED THE ARREST ASKED FOX25 TO HIGH TIDE HADDER IDENTITY.
THE PEOPLE THAT OWNED THE
MULTIFAMILY HOME TOLD MATEO LIVED THERE WITH HIS MOTHER AND
ANOTHER FEMALE RELATIVE.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S JUST AWFUL. I JUST -- IT IS DEPLORABLE.
&gt;&gt; Michael: POLICE SAY MATEO
WEARING A PRETRIAL ANKLE BRACELET AT THE TIME.
THE MAYOR SAYS MATEO IS NOT A
SEX OFFENDER. THE MAYOR DOES THINK THERE'S A
CONNECTION THOUGH BETWEEN THIS
CRIME ANDUN DISCLOSED REASON WHY THE COURTS FORCED MATEO TO WEAR
THE MONITORING SYSTEM.
AS WE LOOK AT LIVE PICTURES ONCE AGAIN OF LAWRENCE POLICE
STEPPING UP PATROLS AROUND ITS
SCHOOL SYSTEM HERE IN THE CITY. WE ALSO KNOW THAT LAWRENCE
POLICE WILL HAVE ANOTHER JOB TO
DO TODAY. THE MAYOR HAS ASKED THE
DEPARTMENT TO GO THROUGH A LIST
OF EVERY PERSON LIVING IN LAWRENCE WEARING A ANKLE
MONITORING BRACELET, FINDING OUT
IF THEY LIVE NEAR THE SCHOOL AND ASSESSING THE THREAT LEVEL.
MATEO HIMSELF WILL BE IN COURT
LATER THIS MORNING. HE WILL FACE A JUDGE ON
ARRAIGNMENT OF CHARGES OF
KIDNAPPING AND AGGRAVATED STATUTORY RAPE.
AHEAD IN THE NEXT 30 MINUTES WE
WILL HAVE ANOTHER LIVE REPORT IN WHICH PARENTS TELL FOX25 WHAT
THEY WILL DO DIFFERENTLY TO KEEP
THEIR KIDS SAFE. LIVE IN LAWRENCE, I'M MICHAEL
HENRICH, FOX25 NEWS.
&gt;&gt; Gene: NEW THIS MORNING A BURLINGTON WOMAN HAS BEEN FOUND
SAFE AFTER DISAPPEARING FOR MORE
THAN 24 HOURS. FOX25 CAMERAS WERE ROLLING WHEN
TANYA CONDON-FRIEDEN WAS FINALLY
FOUND IN SWAMP OFF PRAISE INDUSTRIES IN BILLERICA
OVERNIGHT.
DOGS LOCATED THE 45-YEAR-OLD AND DISAPPEARANCE DID NOT APPEAR TO
BE SUSPICIOUS BUT TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.
ALSO NEW THIS MORNING WE ARE
LOOKING TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE CRASH IN BROCKTON.
SEE A LOT OF FIRST RESPONDERS ON
SCENE AFTER CAR TOOK OUT THE STAIRS TO HOME'S FRONT PORCH.
PICTURES TAKEN ON WILSON STREET
JUST BEFORE MIDNIGHT. NO WORD WHAT CAUSED THE CRASH OR
IF ANYONE WAS HURT.
&gt;&gt; Sara: 13-YEAR-OLD CHELSEA TEN HIT BY A STRAY BULLET WHILE
LYING IN BED STILL HAS BULLET IN
HIS SHOULDER. DOCTORS SAY IT IS TOO SWOLLEN TO
OPERATE.
GOOD NEWS. POLICE ARRESTED THE SUSPECTED
GUNMAN AND HE HEADS TO COURT
LATER TODAY. FOX25 JESSICA REYES IS LIVE AT
THE SCENE IN CHELSEA WHERE THE
TEEN'S FAMILY SAYS THE NEIGHBORHOOD HAS BECOME JUST TWO
DANGEROUS, JESS.
&gt;&gt; Jessica: YES, SARA. THEY SAY THEY ARE SO THANKFUL
THAT POLICE MADE AN ARREST AS
QUICKLY AS THEY DID IN THIS CASE.
EVEN THOUGH THEY SAY IT IS JUST
NOT ENOUGH AND THEY DO NOT FEEL SAFE LIVING HERE ANY MORE AS
THIS IS THE SECOND TIME IN LESS
THAN A YEAR THAT THEIR HOUSE HAS BEEN HIT BY GUN FIRE.
WE KNOW THIS HAPPENED AFTER 8:30
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AFTER THE SUN WENT DOWN.
BULLET FLYING THROUGH THE WALL
OF THIS BUILDING RIGHT HERE HITTING THE 13-YEAR-OLD BOY IN
THE SHOULDER.
&gt;&gt; HERE. &gt;&gt; Jessica: JUST ONE DAY AFTER
BEING HIT BY A STRAY BULLET,
JUAN DELGADO HOME FROM THE HOSPITAL STILL IN PAIN.
HE WAS IN HIS BEDROOM WHEN HE
HEARD GUNSHOT. ONE OF THEM HE TRIED TO RUN FOR
COVER.
&gt;&gt; I RAN TO MY MOM'S ROOM AND FAINTED RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER
ROOM.
&gt;&gt; Jessica: LESS THAN 24 HOURS LATER STATE POLICE ARRESTED
SUSPECT, 19-YEAR-OLD CHRISTIAN
GARCIA OF EVERETT. HE WAS ONE OF TWO PEOPLE INSIDE
A CAR THAT GOT OUT AND STARTED
SHOOTING IN THE PARK NEXT TO THE EIGHTH GRADER'S HOME.
WHILE DELGADO'S FAMILY IS
RELIEVED ABOUT THE ARREST, IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO STAY IN THE
NEIGHBORHOOD.
IT IS THE SECOND TIME IN A YEAR THE HOME HAS BEEN HIT BY GUN
FIRE.
JUAN SIBLINGS SO RELIEVED IT WASN'T MUCH WORSE.
&gt;&gt; I HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF I
DON'T WANT TO LOSE ANOTHER FAMILY MEMBER AND AT THAT MOMENT
WHEN I GOT THE PHONE CALL HE WAS
SHOT, I NEARLY STARTED BURSTING INTO TEARS.
&gt;&gt; THANK GOD HE IS LIVE.
&gt;&gt; Jessica: WANTING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT GANG ACTIVITY IN
THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT A PLACE TO BE SHOOTING AROUND AND ALL &gt;&gt; Gene: ESSEX COUNTY DISTRICT
ATTORNEY SAYS HIS OFFICE HAS
COMPLETED THE REVIEW AND TURNED THE CASE OVER TO US ATTORNEY
CARMEN ORTIZ.
THE MAYOR REVERSED COURSE AND ALLOWED HIM TO RETIRE.
&gt;&gt; Sara: CITGO SIGN AS MUCH
PART OF SKYLINE AS PRU AND HANCOCK BUILDING AND YOUR EYES
GO RIGHT TO IT AT FENWAY PARK
OVER THE GREEN MONSTER. NOW IMAGINE THIS THAT IT IS
GONE.
THAT'S A REAL POSSIBILITY BECAUSE BOSTON UNIVERSITY IS
SELLING THE BUILDING BUT THE
SIGN SITS ON AND COMPANY THAT'S BUYING IT HASN'T SAID WHAT IT
PLANS TO DO.
SO TO PROTECT THE SIGN THE BOSTON LANDMARK COMMISSION
LOOKING TO DESIGNATE IT AS
OFFICIAL LANDMARK. BOSTON MAYOR MARTY WALSH AGREES
WITH THE PLAN.
&gt;&gt; COMMUNITY LOSES A LITTLE BIT OF IDENTITY OF THE PARK AND
EVERYTHING ELSE.
&gt;&gt; Sara: LANDMARK COMMISSION HAS NOT SCHEDULED ANOTHER
MEETING TO DISCUSS THE FUTURE OF
THE SIGN. &gt;&gt; Gene: CHICAGO CUBS LOOK TO
GO TO WORLD SERIES AND LOOK TO
CLINCH IN FRONT OF THEIR FANS. OUT OF JAM IN FIRST GETTING
GROUND OUT TO END THE INNING.
GAVE UP 1 RUN, FIVE HITS AND SEVEN SOLID INNINGS OF WORK.
CUBS PUT IT AWAY.
JAVIER BAEZ BASES LOADED AND CLEARS AND 3-RUN SCORE TO MAKE
EIGHT-ONE.
THE CUBS BEAT DODGERS EIGHT-FOUR AND LEAD THE SERIES THREE-TWO.
CHARLIE SHEEN HASSED OFF TO
REPRISE HIS ROLE AS RICKY WILD THING VAUGHN AND THROW OUT THE
FIRST PUSH OF THE FIRST GAME.
ACTOR POSTED PICTURE ON TWITTER LAST NIGHT SHOWING SHEEN'S
CARLOS COLINA FROM MAJOR LEAGUE.
IT IS UNCONVENTIONAL SET OF PLAYERS.
TOSSING THE IDEA AROUND
WEDNESDAY WHEN INDIANS SECURITY THE SPOT IN THE WORRIES.
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE RICKY
VAUGHN. &gt;&gt; Julie: REALLY FOG AND HE
SHIRI HAS BEEN TELLING US ABOUT
IT ALL MORNING LONG. &gt;&gt; 55 TO 65Â° FOR YOU NOW.
HEADING HOME FROM WORK AT
5:00 P.M. IT IS GOING TO BE CLOSER TO 70
AND HEAVIER RAIN MOVING INTO
TOWN AND WHAT TIME IT ARRIVES COMING BACK.
&gt;&gt; Gene: SEVEN LEVEL THREE SEX
OFFENDERS LIVING IN THE DORCHESTER HOME AND RESIDENT ARE
OUTRAGED.
&gt;&gt; Gene: WHY CITY SAYS NOTHING CAN BE DONE TO MAKE THEM MOVE.
&gt;&gt; FIRST TIME EVER, EVER,
HILLARY SITTING DOWN AND SPEAKING TO MAJOR CORPORATE
LEADERS AND NOT GETTING PAID FOR
IT.</description>

      <description>AS THEY WALK TO SCHOOL.
&gt;&gt; INVESTIGATORS SAY A
13-YEAR-OLD GIRL WAS ABDUCTED, DRAGGED INTO AN APARTMENT
BUILDING AND SEXUAL ASSAULTED
ON HER WAY TO SCHOOL. MICHAEL HENRICH IS LIVE IN
LAWRENCE.
THE GIRL GAVE A DESCRIPTION OF HER ATTACKER TO POLICE, AND
THEY WERE ABLE TO CATCH HIM
PRETTY QUICKLY. &gt;&gt; Reporter: JUST WITHIN A CUP
OF HOURS THEY MADE AN ARREST.
BUT IN SPITE OF THAT, THE MAYOR AND THE POLICE DEPARTMENT WANT
TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE IS
SAFE AND WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE IS SAFE AS THEY HEAD
TO SCHOOL.
WE ARE RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE EAST LAWRENCE
EDUCATIONAL COMPLEX WHERE THAT
13  -YEAR-OLD GIRL WAS WALKING WHEN SHE WAS ABDUCTED.
THE TWO THINGS THAT ARE
HAPPENING THIS MORNING. FIRST AS POLICE MENTIONED,
STEPPING UP PATROLS IN CERTAIN
AREAS OF LAWRENCE SCHOOLS. THE SECOND THING, THE MAYOR HAS
ASKED THE POLICE DEPARTMENT TO
REVIEW A LIST OF ALL PEOPLE LIVING IN LAWRENCE WEARING
ANKLE MONITORING BRACE LET TO
SEE IF THEY LIVE NEAR A SCHOOL AND ASSESS THEIR THREAT LEVEL.
THE REASON THEY ARE DOING THAT
IS BECAUSE THE MAN THEY ARRESTED FOR THIS CRIME,
21-YEAR-OLD ANGEL MATEO WAS
WEARING, ACCORDING TO POLICE, A PRETRIAL ANKLE BRACELET DURING
THE TIME OF THIS ALLEGED
ATTACK. MATEO IS NOT A SEX OFFENDER,
BUT THE MAYOR SAYS HE BELIEVES
THERE IS A CONNECTION BETWEEN THIS CRIME AND THE UNDISCLOSED
REASON WHY THE COURTS INITIALLY
FORCED MATEO TO WEAR THIS MONITORING SYSTEM.
MATEO GRABBED AND FORCIBLY
DRAGGED A 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL INTO A SECOND-FLOOR APARTMENT AND
SEXUALLY ASSAULTING HER WHEN HE
KEPT HER HERE FOR OVER A TWO-HOUR PERIOD.
PARENT THAT LAWRENCE SHOCKED
ABOUT WHAT THEY SAY HAPPENED WILL KEEP AN EXTRA CLOSE EYE ON
THE CHILDREN.
&gt;&gt; I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN LAWRENCE.
YOU WALKED TO SCHOOL AND NOW IT
IS GETTING WORSE. &gt;&gt; WOULD YOU LET YOUR KIDS WALK
TO SCHOOL?
&gt;&gt; NO, NOT ANYMORE. DEFINITELY NOT NOW.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: MATEO FACES A
JUDGE THIS MORNING AND WILL BE ARRAIGNED ON KIDNAPPING AND
AGGRAVATED STATUTORY RAPE
CHARGES. AHEAD IN 30 MINUTES, HEAR FROM
THE MAYOR AS HE HEARS HIS
REACTION TO A, QUOTE, UNSPEAKABLE CRIME AND HEAR HOW
THIS GIRL WAS ABLE TO GET FREE
AND REPORT THE CRIME TO POLICE. FOR NOW, LIVE IN LAWRENCE,
MICHAEL HENRICH, FOX25 MORNING

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; SEVEN DANGEROUS LEVEL 3 SEX
OFFENDERS ALL LIVING IN THE
SAME HOUSE IN DORCHESTER. NEIGHBORS TURN TO FOX25
INVESTIGATES, AND THEY FOUND
OUT ABOUT THIS. WE UNCOVERED THAT SIX OF THE
MEN LIVING AT 96 MILTON AVENUE
HAVE BEEN CONVICTED FOR RAPING A CHILD.
THE OTHER INDECENT ASSAULT AND
BATTERY ON A CHILD. THIS IS ALL ACCORDING TO THE
STATE SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY.
NEIGHBORS TELL US THEY ARE FRUSTRATED BECAUSE THEY WERE
NEVER GIVEN ANY WARNING THOSE
MEN WERE LIVING RIGHT NEXT DOOR IN A NEIGHBORHOOD FILLED WITH
KIDS.
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY ARE LEVEL 3 SEX OFFENDERS, THEY ARE KNOWN TO
REPEAT THE BEHAVIOR AND MY BOYS
ARE A CONCERN. MY NUMBER ONE CONCERN.
THEY COULD SEE MY CHILDREN IN
THE BACK YARD. WE CAN SEE THEM IN THEIR
WINDOWS.

LARGE NUMBER OF LEVEL 3 SEX
OFFENDERS FROM LIVING TOGETHER. BOSTON POLICE TELL US THEY ARE
AWARE OF THE SITUATION AND

      <description>WE ARE CHECKING TRAFFIC AND
WEATHER TOGETHER EVERY TEN
MINUTES. &gt;&gt; Sara:  AND JULIE THIS IS THE
TIME THAT YOU TELL US THAT
THINGS ARE SERIOUS LOW STARTING TO LOW DOWN.
&gt;&gt; Julie:  6:30 IS NO ONE'S
FAVORITE TIME AND BECAUSE OF THIS.
SOMEHOW EVERY DAY AT 6:30
THINGS START TO SLOW DOWN. HEADLIGHTS STACK DOWN.
OUR DRIVE TIME TO 26 MINUTES
AND THE FOG THIS MORNING IS NOT HELPING US WITH THIS SITUATION.
&gt;&gt; Shiri:  THAT WILL CAUSE BIG
TRAVEL HEADACHE. YOUR TRAVEL CONDITIONS WILL
REMAIN FOR -- THROUGH THE
MORNING COMMUTE. BECAUSE OF THE DRIZZLE.
BECAUSE OF THE FOG.
NOONTIME AT 3 P.M., I AM GOING TO GO WITH MODERATE TRAVEL
CONDITIONS JUST BECAUSE SHOWERS

BIT IN THERE AND HEAVIER RAIN
MOVING IN TIME IN FOR THE EVENING COMMUTE.

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; RIGHT NOW AT 6:47.
IT IS A FRIDAY.
WE LIKE THAT. A LOT OF RAIN ON TAP.
&gt;&gt; Sara:  A LOT OF RAIN, A LOT
OF WIND, IT IS FRIDAY AND IT IS THE WEEKEND.
&gt;&gt; Shiri:  YOU KNOW, WE HAD
THAT NEW DROUGHT MONITOR AND NO CHANGES TO MASSACHUSETTS, BUT
THE DROUGHT HAS WORSENED IN
NORTHERN NEW ENGLAND AND THE TREND WILL HELP THAT OUT.
EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T LOVE THE
RAIN ON A FRIDAY OR THE WEEKEND, IT IS HELPFUL AND WE
HAVE HAD SPRINKLES COMING
THROUGH THIS MORNING. MILD HUMID AIR MOVING INTO
PLACE AND WITH ALL THAT
MOISTURE, IT IS GOING TO FUEL THE FOG AND FUEL THE MIST THIS
MORNING, AND EVEN THOUGH IT IS
LOOKING A LITTLE DRIER OUT IN BOSTON, IF YOU WERE IN THE
CITY, YOU KNOW IT IS STILL VERY
MISTY AND DAMP OUT HERE. WE HAVEN'T HAD THAT MUCH
ACCUMULATION AT OR UNDER --
MOSTLY FROM THE LIGHT STUFF. FUTURE CAST AS WE MAKE OUR WAY
THROUGH THE MORNING.
I KNOW IT IS NOT HIGHLIGHTING VERY MUCH, BUT IT IS LIKE IT IS
NOW.
RADAR HAS A TOUGH TIME PICKING UP ON THE MIST TAMPA IT IS
STILL GOING TO BE MISTY AND
FOGGY AT 9:00. THIS MORNING LATE MORNING AND
AS WE WORK OUR WAY THROUGH
LUNCH, WE START SEEING THESE POPS OF STEADIER SHOWERS POP
UP.
SCATTERED RAIN BASICALLY THE NAME OF THE STORY HERE THIS
AFTERNOON.
THE HEAVIEST OF THE RAIN MOVE IN AFTER 4 P.M. AND FOCUSED
ACROSS EASTERN MASSACHUSETTS.
SO WE DO HAVE MORE INTENSE RAIN FORMING FOR THE EVENING
COMMUTE, FOR YOUR DINNERTIME
PLANS OUT THERE. THAT'S WHEN WE ARE GOING TO
PICK UP A LOT OF THAT HALF AN
INCH TO AN INCH OF RAINFALL ACCUMULATION.
THIS AFTERNOON, HIGHLIGHTING
TEMPERATURES IN THE 70s. IT IS MUGGY AND WARM.
IT IS ALMOST SUMMERLIKE OUT
THERE. 70 DEGREES IN BOSTON THIS
AFTERNOON.
72 IN FRAMINGHAM. 74 IN WORCESTER.
HIT ABOUT 70 IN WORCESTER
TODAY. 65 IN PORTSMOUTH, A LITTLE
COOLER.
OUTER CAPE IN THE UPPER 60s. OVER THE WEEKEND, TOMORROW,
THINGS AREN'T IN THE 70s IN
BOSTON. IT IS 60s AND THEN 50s BY YOUR
SUNDAY, SO TEMPERATURES WILL
CONTINUE TO TICK DOWNWARD HERE. WE DO HAVE LINGERING RAIN INTO
YOUR SATURDAY.
SUNDAY WILL BE THE BETTER LOOKING DAY AND PLUS ERIE OUT
THERE.
TOMORROW MORNING WE GET THINGS STARTED WITH THE POTENTIAL OF
SHOWERS.
SCATTERED RAIN REMAINS THE POSSIBILITY HERE THROUGH YOUR
SATURDAY.
WE ARE WATCHING FOR SPOT RAIN AND ALSO WATCHING FOR
DEVELOPING WIND.
IT WILL TURN VERY WINNIE IN THE AFTERNOON.
IT DRAWS IN THE COOLER AIR AND
THAT COOLER AIR IS GOING TO CAUSE A CHANGE FROM RAIN TO
SNOW IN THE MOUNTAINS, SO
SEEING PERHAPS THE FIRST SNOWFLAKES OF THE SEASON IN THE
BERKSHIRES, THE GREEN, THE
WHITE MOUNTAINS LOCALLY. I AM GOING TO STICK WITH A
COUPLE OF SHOWERS AND AS WE
SHIFT INTO YOUR SUNDAY, THINGS WILL START TO DRY OUT VERY
SLOWLY WE START TO BRIGHT  UP.
THE WIND NOT REALLY BUNCHING. WEEKEND WINDS WILL START
GUSTING 30 TO 40 MILES PER HOUR
BY TOMORROW AFTERNOON AND THEY WILL MAINTAIN THAT STRENGTH

AFTER TWO HOURS BEING KEPT
CAPTIVE. ACCORDING TO POLICE AND RIGHT
WHEN SHE GOT TO SCHOOL, SHE
REPORTED THIS RIGHT AWAY. SHE WAS ONLY TWO BLOCKS AWAY
FROM SCHOOL WHEN THIS ABDUCTION
HAPPENED, AND POLICE SAY THAT IS WHY THEY ARE STEPPING PAUP
TROLLS THIS MORNING TO KEEP ALL
OF THE COMMUNITY'S CHILDREN SAFE.
&gt;&gt; CRIME IS.UNSPEAKABLE.
AND WE HAVE TO DO ALL THAT IS POSSIBLE FOR THE MOST
VULNERABLE CITIZENS.

&gt;&gt; Reporter: THE NEIGHBOR WHO WITNESSED ARREST ASKED FOX25 TO
HIDE HER IDENTITY.
THE PEOPLE WHO OWN THE MULTIFAMILY HOME TELL FOX 25
THAT MATEO LIVED THERE WITH HIS

DEPLORABLE. &gt;&gt; Reporter: POLICE SAY THAT
MATEO WAS WEARING A PRETRIAL
ANKLE BRACELET AT THE SAME. THE MAYOR SAYS THAT MATEO IS
NOT A SEX OFFENDER.
THE MAYOR THINKS THERE IS A CONNECTION BETWEEN THIS CRIME
AND THE UNDISCLOSED REASON WHY

THAT IS WHY THE MAYOR IS ASKING
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT TO REVIEW A LIST OF PEOPLE IN LAWRENCE
WEARING ANKLE MONITORING

SWELLING. HE IS GOING FOR THE NEXT TWO
WEEKS AND HAS TO GO BACK TO THE
HOSPITAL FOR SURGERY IN JUST ABOUT A MONTH TO GET THAT
BULLET REMOVED.
JUAN'S SIBLINGS SAY THIS IS THE SECOND TIME IN LESS THAN A YEAR
THEIR HOME HAS BEEN HIT BY
BULLETS AND THEY ARE JUST GLAD THIS WASN'T MUCH WORSE.
&gt;&gt; THEY HAVE THIS EXPERIENCE OF
-- LIKE,  I DON'T WANT TO -- WHEN I HEARD THAT HE WAS HOT, I
WAS LIKE -- I NEARLY JUST
STARTED BURSTING INTO TEARS. &gt;&gt; Reporter: THOSE SHOTS WE
UNDERSTAND WAS FIRED IN THE
PARK NEXT TO THING WHERE WHERE JUAN LIVED AND NEXT TO A PARK.
AND A POPULAR SPOT FOR KIDS
DURING THE DAY. JUAN'S FAMILY MEMBERS, THEY SAY
THEY ARE VERY RELIEVED THAT
POLICE WERE ABLE TO ARREST THIS SUSPECT AS QUICKLY AS THEY DID,
BUT THEY DO SAY IT IS NOT
ENOUGH FOR THEM TO STAY SAFE HERE AND THEY PLAN TO MOVE IN
THE VERY NEAR FUTURE.
THIS SUSPECT IS STILL IN CUSTODY THIS MORNING.
HE IS 19  YEARS OLD AND DUE IN
CHELSEA DISTRICT COURT IN A COUPLE OF HOURS FOR HIS
ARRAIGNMENT AND AS ALWAYS, A

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY
CLINTON SITTING JUST FEET AWAY
FROM EACH OTHER AT A CHARITY GALA.
IT WAS THEIR LAST ATTEMPT
BEFORE THE ELECTION TO SHOW THE PUBLIC THEIR SOFTER SIDE AT
LEAST WHILE ON THE SAME STAGE.
THE ANNUAL FUNDRAISER A USUALLY LIGHTHEARTED BUT THIS YEAR THE
JOKES GOT AWKWARD.
FOX25'S DANIEL MILLER JOINS US NOW.
AND BOTH CANDIDATES HAD GOOD
ONE-LINERS BUT ALSO HAD A FEW BOMBS UP THERE.
&gt;&gt; Daniel:  BOTH SIDES, GENE.
THE AL SMITH MEMORIAL DINNER IS A CHANCE FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATES TO SHOW THEIR FUN
SIDE IN THE CAMPAIGN'S HOME STRETCH BUT LIKE EVERYTHING IN
THIS ELECTION IT WAS UNUSUAL
THIS YEAR AND WHILE DONALD TRUMP GOT SOME LAUGHS, HE ALSO
GOT SOME BOOS.
&gt;&gt; HILLARY CLINTON ACCIDENTALLY BUMPED INTO ME.
AND SHE VERY CIVILLY SAID,
PARDON ME. HILLARY BELIEVES THAT IT IS
VITAL TO DECEIVE THE PEOPLE BY
HAVING ONE PUBLIC POLICY AND A TOLL TEALY DIFFERENT POLICY IN
-- TOTALLY DIFFERENT POLICY IN
PRIVATE. HERE SHE IS TONIGHT IN PUBLIC
PRETENDING NO THE TO HATE
CATHOLICS. NOW SOME OF YOU --
&gt;&gt; Daniel:  FOR HER PART,
HILLARY CLINTON FOCUSED JOKES ON HERSELF.
THOSE GOT SOME LAUGHS BUT HER
SHOTS AT TRUMP FELL A LITTLE FLAT.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS SUCH A SPECIAL EVENT
THAT I TOOK A BREAK FROM MY RIGOROUS NAP SCHEDULE TO BE
HERE.
AND AS YOU ALREADY HEARD, IT'S A TREAT FOR ALL OF YOU TOO,
BECAUSE USUALLY I CHARGE A LOT
FOR SPEECHES LIKE THIS. PEOPLE LOOK AT THE STATUE OF
LIBERTY AND THEY SEE A PROUD
SYMBOL OF OUR HISTORY AS A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS, A BEACON
OF HOPE FOR PEOPLE AROUND THE
WORLD. DONALD LOOKS TO THE STATUE OF
LIBERTY AND SEES A 4.
MAYBE A 5 IF SHE LOSES THE TORCH AND TABLET AND CHANGES
HER HAIR.
&gt;&gt; Daniel:  DURING THE REST OF THE DINNER THE TWO CANDIDATES
WERE SEPARATED BY JUST INCHES
AS NEW YORK CARDINAL TIMOTHY DOLAN SAT IN BETWEEN THEM.
YOU SEE HIM TO THE RIGHT OF
THEM. AFTER THE DINNER, DOLAN
ADMITTED AN UNCOMFORTABLE SEAT.
CAN YOU IMAGINE. IN THE NEWSROOM,
&gt;&gt; Daniel, FOX25 NEWS -- IN THE
NEWSROOM, DANIEL MILLER, FOX25</description>

LOOKING AT HALF AN INCH TO AN
INCH OF RAINFALL LIKELY WITH THE HEAVIEST RAIN OUT ACROSS
THE COAST AND EASTERN
MASSACHUSETTS. WINDS GUSTING 30 TO 40 MILES

RAIN STARTS TO POP UP INTO THE
AFTERNOON HOURS. LET'S TIME IT OUT HERE WITH
FUTURECAST BECAUSE 8, 9:00 THIS
MORNING. MAY NOT BE A LOT ON FUTURE
CAST.
WHAT I EXPECT STILL POCKETS OF FOG AND DRIZZLE AND MIST AND
THE SHOWERS BECOME A LITTLE
MORE SUBSTANTIAL BY LATE MORNING INTO THE AFTERNOON.
FOLLOWING SCATTERED SHOWERS IN
TIME FOR THE EVENING COMMUTE AND DINNERTIME.
HEAVY POCKETS OF RAIN AND THESE
ARE THE DOWNPOURS THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT AND TEMPERATURES7S
GOING TO BE VERY MILD, MUGGY

ENGLAND, THE GREEN AND THE WHITE MOUNTAINS, MAYBE THE
BERKSHIRES.
WE HAVE A FLIP OVER TO SOME SNOWFLAKES.
LOCALLY WE GET YOUR SUNDAY
STARTED WITH THE WIND AGAIN AND ALSO THE CLOUDS THAT WILL SEE
THINGS BRIGHTEN UP DURING THE
SECOND HALF OF THE DAY. SEVEN-DAY FORECAST WITH THE
WEEKEND ALWAYS IN VIEW.
LOWER 70s TODAY WITH RAIN. SHOWERS AROUND TOMORROW WINDY

COMPLICATIONS ARE EXTREMELY

      <description>YET IF THEY PLAN TO SUE THE
CHIROPRACTOR.
&gt;&gt;&gt; A NEW LAW IS ON THE BOOKS AIMED AT PROTECTING FIRE
FIGHTERS AND HELPING TO FIGHT
DEADLY FIRES. GOVERNOR BAKER SIGNED IT AND
CREATES A COMMISSION IF THERE
SHOULD BE CHANGES TO THE WELDING AND HOT.
IT COMES TWO YEARS AFTER ED
WALSH AND MIKE KENNEDY WAS KILLED BY FIRE IN THE BACK BAY.
IT WAS CAUSED BY WELDING WORK
DONE WITHOUT A CITY PERMIT. &gt;&gt; THAT DAY ON A BEACON STREET
COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED IF
THIS HAD ALREADY BEEN PUT IN PLACE AND TWO FIRE FIGHTERS
COULD BE ALIVE TODAY.
THE COMMISSION HAS UNTIL JUNE TO REPORT BACK TO STATE
LAWMAKERS WHETHER TITLE
REGULATIONS ARE NEEDED. AND WE GOT VERY HIGH HUMIDITY
WITH DEW POINTS IN THE UPPER
60s TODAY CONTRIBUTESING TO THE FOG AND THE DRIZZLE THIS
MORNING, BUT HEAVY DOWNPOURS
LATER ON. WE CAN SEE THE WEEKEND SLOWLY
START TO DRY OUT BUT THE WINDS
ARE ONLY GOING TO START TO INCREASE.
THE CHANGES THIS WEEKEND COMING
UP.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; HAPPENING NOW, MORE POLICE
OFFICERS ARE MONITORING THE
SIDEWALKS THIS MORNING, KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON KIDS AS THEY
WALK TO SCHOOL.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS IN ALL RESPONSE TO A SHOCKING CRIME COMMITTED
AGAINST A 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL.
SHE WAS GRABBED WHILE WALKING TO SCHOOL, DRAGGED INTO AN
APARTMENT BUILDING AND SEXUALLY
ASSAULTED. FOX25'S MICHAEL HENRICH IS IN
LAWRENCE AND THAT GIRL WAS VERY
CLOSE TO HER SCHOOL. &gt;&gt; Reporter: LESS THAN A
QUARTER OF MILE AND SHE WAS SO
CLOSE TO SAFETY AT THE EAST EDUCATIONAL COMPLEX WHERE SHE
WAS WALKING AROUND 8:00.
A CUP OF THINGS ARE HAPPENING FROM A SAFETY STANDPOINT.
FIRST AS YOU MENTIONED POLICE
ARE STEPPING UP PATROLS IN THE AREAS OF SCHOOLS HERE IN
LAWRENCE.
OTHER THING WAS ASKED FOR BY THE MAYOR SAYING THAT HE WANTS
POLICE TO GO THROUGH THE ENTIRE
LIST OF PEOPLE WEARING ANKLE MONITORING BRACELETS IN
LAWRENCE.
CHECK IF THEY LIVE NEAR A SCHOOL, AND THEN ASSESS THEIR
THREAT LEVEL.
WHY THAT SECOND STEP? WELL, POLICE SAY THE MAN THEY
ARRESTED 21-YEAR-OLD ANGEL
MATEO WAS WEARING AN ANGEL-MONITORING BRACELET AT
THE TIME OF THE ALLEGED ATTACK.
THE MAYOR SAYS MATEO IS NOT A SEX OFFENDER BUT THE MAYOR SAYS
DOES THINK THERE IS A
CONNECTION BETWEEN THIS CRIME AND THE UNDISCLOSED REASON WHY
THE COURTS HAD MATEO WEAR THE
ANKLE SYSTEM. MATEO GRABBED AND FORCIBLY
GRABBED IN POOR 13-YEAR-OLD
GIRL INTO A SECOND-FLOOR APARTMENT AND SEXUALLY
ASSAULTED HER AS HE KEPT HER
THERE OVER A TWO-HOUR PERIOD. PARENTS IN LAWRENCE ARE SHOCKED
OVER WHAT HAPPENED AND THEY
WILL KEEP AN EXTRA CLOSE EYE ON THEIR CHILDREN NOW.
&gt;&gt; I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN
LAWRENCE, WALKED TO SCHOOL, AND NOW IT IS GETTING WORSE, THE
CITY.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: WOULD YOU LET YOUR KIDS WALK TO SCHOOL?
&gt;&gt; NO,  NOT ANYMO MORE.
DEFINITELY NOT NOW. &gt;&gt; Reporter: MATEO WILL FACE A
JUDGE THIS MORNING FOR HIS
ARRAIGNMENT ON KIDNAPPING AND AGGRAVATED SACH TORY RAPE
CHARGES.
NOW AHEAD IN 30 MINUTES, HEAR FROM THE MAYOR AS HE SPEAKS
ABOUT WHAT HE CALLS AN
UNSPEAKABLE CRIME AND LEARN HOW THIS YOUNG GIRL MANAGED TO GET
AWAY.

      <description>HENRICH, FOX25 NEWS.
&gt;&gt;&gt; NOW AT 5:34 THIS MORNING,
SEVERAL LEVEL 3 SEX OFFENDERS LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE IN
DORCHESTER.
NEIGHBORS TURNED TO FOX25 INVESTIGATE.
WHEN THEY FOUND OUT ABOUT IT,
WE UNCOULD HAVE HAD SIX OF THE MEN AT 96 MILTON AVENUE HAVE
BEEN CONVICTED FOR RAPING A
CHILD. THE OTHER INDECENT ASSAULT AND
BATTERY ON A CHILD, ALL
ACCORDING TO THE STATE'S SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY.
NEIGHBORS TELL US THEY ARE
FRUSTRATED BECAUSE THEY WERE NEVER GIVEN ANY WARNING THAT
THOSE MEN WERE LIVING RIGHT
NEXT DOOR IN A NEIGHBORHOOD FILLED WITH KIDS.
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY ARE LEVEL 3 SEX
OFFENDERS, THEY ARE KNOWN TO REPEAT THE BEHAVIOR.
AND MY BOYS ARE MY CONCERN, ANY
NUMBER ONE CONCERN. THEY CAN SEE MY CHILDREN IN THE
BACK YARD.
WE CAN SEE THEM IN THEIR WINDOWS.
&gt;&gt; Gene:  NO STATE LAW OR
REGULATION THAT PREVENTS A LARGE NUMBER OF LEVEL 3 SEX
OFFENDERS FROM LIVING TOGETHER.
THEY TELL US THAT THEY ARE AWARE OF THE SITUATION AND
ROUTINE TEE SEND OFFICERS TO
CHECK ON THE SEX OFFENDERS.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; A FLASH MOB STEALS
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF
iPHONES RIGHT OUT OF AN APPLE STORE INSIDE OF A LOCAL STORE
AND A CRIME POLICE ARE SEEN
BEFORE. FOX25'S CATHERINE PARROTTA IS
LIVE IN NATICK WITH THE
SURVEILLANCE VIDEO THAT CAUGHT THIS WHOLELE THING AS IT
UNFOLDED, CATHERINE.
&gt;&gt; NATICK POLICE ARE WORKING TO TRACK DOWN THE SUSPECT, AND
THEY HAVE RELEASED THAT
SURVEILLANCE VIDEO FOR EVERYONE TO SEE.
AND TAKE A LOOK AT THAT RIGHT
NOW. YOU CAN SEE A GROUP OF PEOPLE
WALKING INTO THE NATICK MALL
THERE. THIS HAPPENED WEDNESDAY NIGHT.
AND YOU CAN SEE THEY HAD HOODS
AND HATS ON. YOU CAN SEE THEM THEN IN THE
APPLE STORE WITH A LOT OF OTHER
CUSTOMERS AROUND. POLICE SAY THEY MANAGED TO CUT
SECURITY CORDS AND LEAVE WITH
19 PHONES. THAT LOSS IS VALUED AT AROUND
$13,000.
AND IT IS ESPECIALLY CONCERNING GIVEN A NEW TREND THAT APPLE IS
TESTING OUT IN SOME OF ITS
STORES IN CANADA AND THE UK. STORES ARE UNTETHERING THE
PHONES SO CUSTOMERS CAN WALK
AROUND AND GET A FEEL FOR THEM AND THAT CHANGE CAN BE ROLLED
NUT IN THE U.S. NEXT YEAR.
APPLE SAY ALARMS WILL GO OFF IF THOSE PHONES DO LEAVE THE
STORE; HOWEVER, THAT DOESN'T
SEEM TO DETER SOME OF THE SUSPECTS IN THIS CASE AND ALSO
ANOTHER CASE THAT HAPPENED
ABOUT B A MONTH AGO. NATICK POLICE ARE SEEING IF
THESE TWO CASES ARE CONNECTED.
WE WILL LEARN MORE ABOUT THAT IN AN HOUR.

ASSAULTED HER. A COUPLE OF THINGS ARE
HAPPENING THIS MORNING.
FIRST AND FOREMOST EVEN WITH THE ARRESTS MADE POLICE ARE
STEPPING UP PATROLS IN THE AREA
OF LAWRENCE SCHOOLS TO MAKE SURE KIDS GET TO SCHOOL SAFELY.
SECOND, THE MAYOR HAS ASKED THE
POLICE DEPARTMENT TO REVIEW EVERY INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS AN
ANKLE MONITORING BRACELET ON
AND WHO LIVES NEAR A SCHOOL AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE IN THE
UP AND UP AND WHERE THEY ARE
SUPPOSED TO BE. WHY THAT PARTICULAR STEP
SNAPPING BECAUSE POLICE SAY
THAT THE MAN THEY ARRESTED, 21-YEAR-OLD ANGEL MATEO WEARING
A PRETRIAL ANKLE BRACELET
DURING THE TIME OF THIS ALLEGED AIT CAN.
MATEO IS NOT A SEX OFFENDER BUT
THE MAYOR THINKS THERE IS A CONNECTION BETWEEN IN CRIME AND
THE UNDISCLOSED REASON THAT THE
COURTS FORCED MATEO TO WIN THE MONITORING SYSTEM IN THE FIRST
PLACE.
MATEO DRAGGED AND FORCIBLY DRAGGED A 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL INTO
A SECOND-FLOOR APARTMENT ON
PHILLIPS STREET AROUND 8:00 YESTERDAY MORNING, SEXUALLY
ASSAULTING HER AS HE KEPT HER
THERE FOR A TWO-HOUR PERIOD. &gt;&gt; THIS CRIME IS UNSPEAKABLE
AND WE NEED TO DO ALL THAT IS
POSSIBLE FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE CITIZENS.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THE YOUNG VICTIM
REPORTED WHAT HAPPENED TO HER SCHOOL.
THEN POLICE -- AND THEN TO
POLICE. AND GAVE INVESTIGATORS A
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF HER
ATTACKER, WHICH LED THEM TO MATEO WITHIN HOURS.
MATEO WILL FACE A JUDGE FOR
ARRAIGNMENT ON KIDNAPPING AND STATUTORY RAPE CHARGES.
AHEAD IN 30 MINUTES, HEAR WHAT
PARENT ARE TELLING FOX25 ABOUT THE CHANGES THEY WILL MAKE TO
THEIR ROUTINES WITH THEIR
FAMILIES AFTER IN THE MAYOR'S WORD THIS UNSPEAKABLE CRIME
OCCURRED.

ONLY IN THE 8th GRADE.
THE BULLET HE SAYS IS LODGED INSIDE HIS SHOULDER.
DOCTORS WERE UNABLE TO TAKE IT
OUT BECAUSE OF ALL THE SWELLING AND HE IS GOING TO BE OUT OF
SCHOOL FOR THE NEXT FEW WEEKS.
HE HAS TO GO BACK TO THE HOSPITAL WE UNDERSTAND FOR
SURGERY IN JUST ABOUT A MONTH
FROM NOW TO HAVE THAT BULLET FINALLY REMOVED FROM HIS
SHOULDER.
HE TELLS US HE WAS IN BED AT THE TIME LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT,
AND THE WHOLE THING WAS PRETTY
SURREAL. &gt;&gt; AND I RAN TO MY MOM'S ROOM,
AND I, LIKE, FAINTED IN FRONT
OF HER ROOM. &gt;&gt; Reporter: THE PARK OUTSIDE
JUAN'S WINDOW WHERE THE
SHOOTING HAPPENED IS A POPULAR PLAY SPOT FOR KIDS, AND HE AND
HIS FAMILY SAY THEY ARE
THANKFUL THAT THE SUSPECT HAS BEEN ARRESTED, THEY DO PLAN TO
MOVE FROM THIS NEIGHBORHOOD AS

BEEN HIT BY GUNFIRE.
BUT ONCE AGAIN, THAT SUSPECT IS IN CUSTODY.
HE IS 19 YEARS OLD FROM EVERETT
AND DUE OVER AT CHELSEA DISTRICT COURT FOR HIS
ARRAIGNMENT AND, OF COURSE, WE

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY
CLINTON WITH A BRIEF CLOSE
ENCOUNTER AT A FUNDRAISER FOR A CATHOLIC CHARITY.
TRUMP PATS CLINTON ON THE
SHOULDER AS HE GETS READY TO TAKE THE PODIUM.
THE FUNDRAISER IS USUALLY
LIGHTHEARTED BUT THIS YEAR DEFINITELY A FEW AWKWARD
MOMENTS.
THE JOKES FROM BOTH CANDIDATES THAT GOT LAUGHS AND, DANIEL,
EVEN A BU BOOS.
&gt;&gt; Daniel:  STAYED UP TO WATCH IT THE AL SMITH MEMORIAL DINNER
IS A CHANCE FOR THE
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES TO SHOW THEIR FUN SIDE IN THE
CAMPAIGN'S HOME STRETCH, BUT
LIKE MOST OTHER THINGS IN THIS ELECTION, IT WAS UNUSUAL THIS
YEAR, AND WHILE DONALD TRUMP
GOT SOME LAUGHS, HE ALSO GOT SOME BOOS.
&gt;&gt; HILLARY CLINTON ACCIDENTALLY
BUMPED INTO ME AND SHE VERY CIVILLY SAID, PARDON ME.
HILLARY CLINTON BELIEVES IT IS
VITAL TO DECEIVE THE PEOPLE BY HAVING ONE PUBLIC POLICY AND A
TOTALLY DIFFERENT POLICY IN
PRIVATE. HERE SHE IS TONIGHT IN PUBLIC
PRETENDING NOT TO HATE
CATHOLICS. &gt;&gt; Daniel:  FOR HER PART, SHE
FOCUSED MANY OF THE JOKES ON
HERSELF. BOTH GOT LAUGHS BUT HER SHOTS
AT TRUMP FELL A LITTLE FLAT.
DURING THE DINNER THE TWO WERE SEPARATED BY JUST INCHES AS YOU
SEE HERE AND CARDINAL TIMOTHY
DOLAN THAT SAT IN BETWEEN THEM. AFTER THE DINNER, CARDINAL
DOLAN ADMITTED TWAS AN
UNCOMFORTABLE SEAT AS YOU CAN IMAGINE.

MEAN VOLUME IS LIGHT BUT FOG IS LINGERING.
YOU WILL SEE FOG IN MANY PARTS
AROUND TOWN TODAY. I AM REMINDING EVERYONE, LEAVE
A FEW MINUTES EARLY IF YOU CAN
SO YOU CAN SLOW DOWN AND ACCOMMODATE FOR THE VISIBILITY
WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT OF A
CHALLENGE. YOUR LIVE DRIVE TIMES.
12 MINUTES ON ROUTE 1 FROM 128
TO THE TOBIN. 20 MINUTES ON 93 SOUTH.
24 MINUTES ON THE PIKE

      <description>AVENUE.
BACK TO YOU.
&gt;&gt;&gt; IT IS 5:17 NOW ON THIS -- &gt;&gt; Gene:  FRRRR-IDAY.
&gt;&gt; KIND OF UGLY OUT THERE.
CONDITIONS ARE NOT THE BEST YOU HAVE SEEN THIS WEEK.
ON-AND-OFF SHOWERS NOT
POSSIBLE. AN INCH OF RAINFALL, AND WE ARE
STILL DETERMINING EXACTLY WHERE
THAT SWATH OF HEAVY RAIN WILL FALL LIKELY ACROSS EASTERN MASS
AN VERY WINDY THIS WEEKEND WITH
GUSTS 30 TO 40  MILES PER HOUR BOTH SAYS.
WE HAVE THIS AREA OF LIGHT
RAIN. YOU CAN SEE TRAVELING REALLY
ACROSS THE MASS PIKE AND
NORTHWARD HERE, BUT A LOT OF SPOTS IN SOUTHEASTERN
MASSACHUSETTS UP INTO SOUTHERN
NEW HAMPSHIRE. WE JUST GOT THIS DRIZZLY KIND
OF MISTY SET-UP.
59 DEGREES IN NORWOOD. YOU SEE THAT.
WE GOT REPORTS OF SPRINKLES
EVEN THOUGH RADAR IS NOT PICKING IT UP VERY WELL NOW.
7 A.M., 59 DEGREES.
9 A.M., 65. WE GET INTO THE 70s, BUT WE
HAVE THAT ALL-DAY THREAT FOR
SHOWERS. WE BREAK IT DOWN EASIER WITH
FUTURE CAST.
I KNOW FUTURECAST NOT BRINGING UP A LOT OF RAIN.
THIS IS WHEN WE ARE GOING TO BE
IN THE -- IN THE DRIZZLE AND THE FOG.
SOMETIMES THOSE LITTLE
PARTICLES ARE SO FINE RADAR DOESN'T PICK THEM UP VERY WELL
EVEN IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT THAT
FOX25 WEATHER APP AND YOU LOOK LIKE YOU ARE IN THE CLEAR, YOU
WILL PROBABLY GET PATCHES OF
SPRINKLES ON YOUR WAY INTO WORK THIS MORNING.
NOONTIME COMES ALONG AND MORE
SUBSTANTIAL SHOWERS THAT ARE POPPING UP.
SCATTERED SHOWERS REALLY
THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON PICKING UP IN INTENSITY AROUND
4 P.M. YOU CAN SEE IN TIME FOR
THE EVENING COMMUTE, BURSTS OF HEAVIER RAIN COMING IN AND THAT
COULD PLAGUE YOUR FRIDAY NIGHT.
COULD WOBBLE INLAND OR OUT TO SEA.
RIGHT NOW EASTERN MASSACHUSETTS
REALLY LOOKS LIKE THE HOT SPOT FOR DOWNPOURS.
70  THIS AFTERNOON IN BOSTON
AND LAWRENCE. 74 IN NORWOOD.
69 IN WORCESTER.
73 IN NASHUA, NEW HAMPSHIRE. UPPER 60s ACROSS THE CAPE AND
ISLANDS AND FUTURE CAST AS WE
ROLL INTO THE WEEKEND, SCATTERED RAIN LEFT HERE ALONG
WITH A TON OF CLOUD COVER FOR
YOUR SATURDAY. I HAVE GOT SOME SHOWERS IN THE
GAME PLAN HERE FOR YOU ON
SATURDAY. WE ALSO HAVE INCREASING WINDS
THAT REALLY INCREASE DURING THE
AFTERNOON HOURS. DRAWING IN THE COOLER AIR AND
THAT WILL CHANGE A LITTLE FLIP
OVER SOME SNOWFLAKES AT HIGHER ELEVATIONS.
WE ARE TALKING GREEN AND WHITE
MOUNTAINS, EVEN THE BERKSHIRES SHOWING A COUPLE OF FLAKES.
SATURDAY NIGHT.
SUNDAY, NORTHERN NEW ENGLAND A FEW OF THOSE FLAKES.
SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND DRYING
OUT. WINDY AND CLOUDY TO START OFF
YOUR MORNING HERE ON SUNDAY BUT
WE WILL BRIGHTEN UP AS THE DAY GOES ON.
UNFORTUNATELY IT WILL TAKE A
BIT LONGER TO REALLY SHED THE WIND AND NEXT WEEK WILL BE
BREEZY AS WELL.
HIGHS UPPER 60s TO LOWER 60s WITH THAT RAIN THREAT BY
SUNDAY.
TEMPERATURE-WISE WE ARE GOING TO BE IN THE 50s.
SO SEVEN DAY FORECAST OF THE
WEEKEND ALWAYS IN VIEW HAS THE WINDBLOWN REFALL-LIKE WEEKEND.
63 ON SATURDAY.
56 ON SUNDAY AS WE DRY OUT. MONDAY A FEW SHOWERS 59 DEGREES
AND GOING DRY, TUESDAY,
WEDNESDAY AND MOST OF THURSDAY.</description>

CHANGES TO THE WELDING AND HOT WORKS.
IT COMES TWO YEARS AFTER ED
WALSH AND MIKE KENNEDY WERE KILLED IN A FIRE IN THE BACK

FOX25 STORM TRACKER WEATHER
CENTER. &gt;&gt; Shiri:  WHIPPING WINDS THIS
WEEKEND.
THANKFULLY LIGHT WIND AND DENSE FOG FROM CHATHAM TO NORWOOD UP
TO BOSTON TO PORTSMOUTH, NEW
HAMPSHIRE OVER TO WORCESTER AS WELL.
NO DOUBT WHEREVER YOU ARE
TRAVELLING THIS MORNING, YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE SOME TRAVEL
SLOWDOWNS BECAUSE OF THAT FOG
AND ALSO SOME SHOWERS. A LOT OF GREEN ON THE MAP NOW.
MOST OF THIS WILL BE IN THE
FORM OF LIGHT RAIN THIS MORNING FROM FRAMINGHAM UP TO
BURLINGTON AND UP TO HAMPSTEAD,
NEW HAMPSHIRE. YOU CAN SEE THE SHOWERS
CONTINUE INTO THE WORCESTER
HILLS HERE UP INTO FITCHBURG. TEMPERATURES THERE IN THE 50s
AND STARTING OFF IN THE MIDDLE
60s DOWN ACROSS THE SOUTH SHORE.
I KNOW IT LOOKS DRY FROM STORM
TRACKER RADAR AND STILL MISTY BECAUSE OF THE FOG.
A WET START FOR EVERYBODY AND
60 DEGREES AT 7 A.M. LOWER 70s AT NOON.
SCATTERED SHOWERS A POSSIBILITY
THROUGHOUT THE DAY, BUT I HAVE GOT 7 P.M. HERE WITH SOME OF
OUR HEAVIEST AND STEADIEST
RAIN. I WILL TIME OUT THE SHOWERS
WITH FUTURECAST AND BACK IN TEN
MINUTES. JULIE GRAUERT LIVE WITH DRIVE
TIME TRAFFIC.
&gt;&gt; ONE TRAIN CANCELLED THE 6:40 A.M. FROM LOWELL IS CANCELLED
BECAUSE OF A MECHANICAL ISSUE.
TRAIN 206 WILL MAKE UNSCHEDULED STOPS TO ACCOMMODATE FOR THOSE
PASSENGERS.
OUT ON THE ROADS, THINGS QUIET FROM THE EXPRESSWAY FROM THE
BRAINTREE SPLIT TO COLUMBIA
ROAD. NORTH OF THE PIKE,</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt; NO.
&gt;&gt; WAIT.
&gt;&gt; AS HE WAS GOING BY, YOU SEE THE EXPRESS TRAIN G
BY.
WE LOSE SIGHT OF HIM. YOU CAN SEE RIGHT THERE -- THERE
HE IS.
HE STARTS CLIMBING BACK AROUND. THIS IS ABOUT THE MOMENT WHERE
HE LOSES A LITTLE BIT OF HIS
FOOTING. THE FIRST ONE IS ON THE OTHER
SIDE.
THIS ONE, HOWEVER, IT RIGHT NEXT TO THE PLATFORM.
WHEN THIS EXPRESS TRAIN FINISHES
PASSING BY AND WE GET A VIEW R YOU CAN SEE THE GENTLEMAN THERE
NOW LYING ON THE PLATFORM.
FOR A MOMENT, HE LIES THERE LIFELESS.
DON'T WORRY, OKAY.
HE WASN'T DIRECTLY HIT, THEY SAY, BY THE TRAIN.
AS IT CAME THROUGH AT HIGH
SPEED, HE WAS HIT BY THE WIND, BY THE TURBULENCE.
HE LANDED THERE.
NOW, HE DID END UP IN AN AMBULANCE.
HE DID END UP GETTING TAKEN TO HOSPITAL.
WHILE HE MAY HAVE TRIED TO SAVE
HIMSELF A FEW RUBLES, IT ALMOST</description>

      <description>COST HIM HIS LIFE.
&gt;&gt;&gt; THERE'S A SECOND VIDEO.
SEE IF YOU CAN SPOT WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT.
THAT TRAM, I SUPPOSE, IS KIND OF
BLOWING UP A A LOT OF DUST. &gt;&gt; IS THIS NOT ON TRACKS?
&gt;&gt; IT'S DRAGGING SOMEBODY.
&gt;&gt; IT'S DRAGGING SOMEBODY BEHIND IT.
THE GUY IS WAVING.
OTHER CARS ARE CHASING IT DOWN. THEY WERE HONKING THEIR HORNS.
THE GUY, 27-YEAR-OLD MAN, GOT
HIS FOOT CAUGHT AS THE DOORS WERE CLOSING.
THE TRAM, WITHOUT REALIZING,
CONTINUED DOWN. &gt;&gt; GOOD NEWS IS HE'S MOVING
AROUND AND ABLE TO LIFT HIS
HEAD. &gt;&gt; HE MAY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LIFT
HIS HEAD, BUT IT DIDN'T PREVENT
HIM FROM SOME PRETTY SERIOUS INJURIES.
HE HAS SOME PRETTY SERIOUS, I
SUPPOSE YOU WOULD CALL IT, RAIL RASH ALONG HIS BODY.
HIS HANDS ARE TORN RAW.
SPRAINS, KNEE INJURIES. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SEEN THIS,
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE OUTRAGE

      <description>THE 44-YEAR-OLD DRIVER SHOULD BE
FOUND NEGLIGENT IN THIS CASE.
&gt;&gt;&gt; WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS A HIKER IN A VERY BEAUTIFUL AREA.
HE SPOTTED SOMETHING.
YOU SEE THIS YOUNG BEAR COMING THROUGH THE WOODS.
&gt;&gt; BEAR?
OH, HI, BUDDY. WHERE'S MUM?
THAT'S MY QUESTION.
&gt;&gt; THIS BEAR DOESN'T SEE THE HIKER WITH THE CAMERA.
THE HIKER DECIDES TO REVEAL
HIMSELF RIGHT HERE. WHAT SHOULD HE DO?
&gt;&gt; MAKE YOURSELF LOOK BIG AND
MAKE LOTS OF NOISE. ROAR, GO AWAY, BEAR!
&gt;&gt; THAT'S BETTER THAN WHAT HE
DOES. IT RAN AWAY.
HE STEPPED OUT AND SAID, WHAT'S
UP, BRO? &gt;&gt; THE FORESTRY DEPARTMENT GOT
AHOLD OF THIS VIDEO AND SAID, DO
NOT DO THIS.</description>

      <description>THE BEAR COULD HAVE ATTACKED THE
MAN.
&gt;&gt;&gt; THE NEXT VIDEO, I HAVE A DON'T FOR LEOPARDS.
SEE THAT LEOPARD SITTING ON THE
BANK OF A DRY RIVER BED? LOOK OFF IN THE DISTANCE.
THERE'S A LION.
A MALE LION. THAT LEOPARD THINKS, AH, I'M
SAFE.
SO THE LEOPARD DECIDES, YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M JUST GOING TO TAKE A
NAP.
THAT'S WHEN MUFASA RIGHT HERE STARTS DOING THE SLOW CREEP UP
ON THE LEOPARD.
THE LION IS GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER.
&gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK THE LEOPARD
CARES. &gt;&gt; HE WOKE UP READY TO GO.
&gt;&gt; I THINK THAT LEOPARD JUST
KNOWS THERE'S NO WAY THIS CAT IS GOING TO KEEP UP WITH ME.
AS SOON AS I TURN ON THE JETS.
&gt;&gt; LET ME SHOW YOU WHERE THEY ENDED UP.
&gt;&gt; UP A TREE?
&gt;&gt; BINGO. THE LION TOOK A STEP FROM WHAT
LITTLE WATER THERE WAS IN THERE
AND KIND OF WALKED OFF. THE ULTIMATE LION WALK OF SHAME
BECAUSE HE LEFT WITH NOTHING TO
EAT.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; IN IRELAND, THERE'S AN ISSUE
WITH CAR BOOTING.
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE GOT GOING ON HERE.
NATHAN, THE GUY IN THE BLUE
SHIRT, HAS GOT A BOOT ON HIS MERCEDES.
BUT HE'S GOT A TOOL BOX OUT.
HE'S PUTTING HIS RATCHET BEHIND THE BOOT AND TAKING THE WHEEL
OFF HIS CAR.
&gt;&gt; USUALLY YOU'VE GOT A BOOT ON FOR A GOOD REASON.
IN THE UK, I CAN ATTEST.
TRUST ME. THERE ARE PREDATORY GUYS THAT GO
AROUND BOOTING AND STIFF YOU FOR
MONEY. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHERE THIS VIDEO TAKES
US.
IN FACT, THE GUY'S LADY IS RECORDING BECAUSE I BELIEVE THE
GUY WHO PUT THE BOOT ON IS JUST
OFF CAMERA. WHILE NATHAN IS REMOVING THE
WHEEL WITH THE BOOT, A BLACK BMW
PULLS UP, MAN GETS OUT. &gt;&gt; HE'S TAKING HIS TIRE OFF.
THAT'S ALL HE'S DOING.
EXCUSE ME. &gt;&gt; LISTEN TO ME NOW.
&gt;&gt; MY SON IS IN THE BACK OF CAR.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S WHEN THE WOMAN SAYS BEFORE THIS GETS OUT OF HAND,
WE'VE GOT A KID IN THE CAR.
&gt;&gt; THERE'S AN EASIER WAY TO DO THIS.
&gt;&gt; THEY OWN BOOTS?
&gt;&gt; ACCORDING TO THE GUY IN THE RED SWEATSHIRT, IT'S HIS
COMPANY, HIS BOOT.
HE'S THE GUY GOING AROUND PUTTING THE BOOTS ON THE
VEHICLES.
&gt;&gt; I THINK THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE THE ONES PUTTING SOMETHING ON
YOU, NOT SOME CONTRACTOR.
&gt;&gt; IN A COMMENT ON THIS VIDEO, NATHAN SAYS HE'S BEEN PARKING IN
THIS AREA FOR ABOUT 12 YEARS,
NEVER HAD A PROBLEM UNTIL NOW. NATHAN CONTINUES TO WRESTLE WITH
THE WHEEL.
RIGHT UNDERNEATH THIS GUY'S NOSE, HE PULLS HIS WHEEL OUT OF
THE BOOT AND TOSSES IT ASIDE.
&gt;&gt; GOOD FOR HIM. &gt;&gt; I'D HAVE PUT THE BOOT IN MY
TRUNK AND MADE HIM PAY ME TO GET
IT OUT.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE A BIG FAN OF
POLICE PROCEDURAL SHOWS OR HAVE
HAD MANY RUN-INS WITH THE POLICE, YOU'LL BE ONLY TOO AWARE
OF POLICE MUST ADVISE A SUSPECT
OF THEIR MIRANDA RIGHTS. DOES ANYBODY KNOW THEM?
&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN
SILENT. THEN IN THE MOVIES, THAT'S WHEN
THEY PUNCH THE GUY BECAUSE HE
STARTS TALKING. &gt;&gt; THAT'S JUST ABOUT EVERYBODY'S
REAL UNDERSTANDING.
WHEN THEY'RE REALLY PUT ON THE SPOT, NO ONE'S REALLY QUITE
SURE.
THAT'S WHY THE GUYS FROM HUDSON AND HARRIS IN WACO, TEXAS, ARE
GOING TO TEACH US.
âª YOU'VE BROKEN THE LOW LAWS YOU'VE DONE NOTHING WRONG âª
âª WHEN AN OFFICER ASKS YOU
WHO BELONGS TO THAT BONG âª âª MIRANDA, PLEASE KNOW
YOUR RIGHTS âª
âª TALKING COULD LAND YOU IN JAIL FOR THE NIGHT âª
&gt;&gt; ALL OF THIS, OF COURSE, A
COVER OF "AMANDA" BY WAYLON JENNINGS.
âª AMANDA, LIGHT OF MY LIFE âª
&gt;&gt; BASICALLY WHAT THEY'RE SAYING, SHUSH.
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE EVERYTHING YOU SAY
CAN AND WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU IN THE COURT OF LAW.
&gt;&gt; WE'RE LEARNING ALREADY.
WE HAVE LIVE VIA SKYPE RIGHT THIS MINUTE, CHRIS AND WILL.
&gt;&gt; HELLO, GUYS.
HOW ARE YOU? &gt;&gt; THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME
YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
IN FACT, ONE OF YOUR VIDEOS GOT OVER 300,000 VIEWS.
âª PLEASE DON'T EAT YOUR WEED
IT'S A CLASS B MISDEMEANOR âª &gt;&gt; WHY DO YOU DO THIS?
&gt;&gt; NOBODY WANTS TO READ A LEGAL
BLOG. APPARENTLY A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL
LISTEN TO SONGS.
THAT'S WHY WE DO IT. &gt;&gt; HAVE YOU FOUND SINCE YOU'RE
GIVING AWAY THIS FREE LEGAL
ADVICE THAT YOUR BUSINESS HAS GONE UP OR DOWN?
&gt;&gt; IT HAS NOT GONE DOWN.
I CAN'T SAY IT HAS INCREASED OUR REVENUE YET.
&gt;&gt; DO YOU SING IN COURT?
&gt;&gt; I'VE HAD A JUDGE ASKED ME AS RECENTLY AS A WEEK AGO IF I WAS
GOING TO DELIVER A CLOSING
ARGUMENT VIA SONG. I SAID NO, NOBODY WANTS THAT.
&gt;&gt; YOU THOUGHT ABOUT IT.
I CAN TELL. &gt;&gt; I ALMOST DID.
&gt;&gt; DO YOU PERFORM TOGETHER,
BESIDES DOING ADVERTISEMENTS FOR YOUR FIRM?
&gt;&gt; YEAH, ACTUALLY, WE DO.
OCCASIONALLY WE'LL PLAY THE ODD BIRTHDAY PARTY.
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU GUYS EXPLORING
DIFFERENT GENRES? LIKE RAP, MAYBE A LITTLE R&amp;B.
&gt;&gt; THE NEXT ONE IS KIND OF A
'90s POP/PUNK SOUND.</description>

      <description>SO THAT'LL BE TERRIBLE.
âªâª
&gt;&gt;&gt; THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE IN BUILDING ONE'S CONFIDENCE AND
GOING WAY TOO FAR.
THIS TEAM BUILDING CAMP CROSSED THE LINE.
THIS IS A GROUP OF GIRLS WALKING
THROUGH A MUDDY PIT. &gt;&gt; THIS IS AN EXERCISE?
&gt;&gt; YES, IT'S AN EXERCISE THE
COORDINATORS SAY IS SUPPOSED TO BUILD THEIR SELF-CONFIDENCE.
&gt;&gt; WHAT THE HECK.
&gt;&gt; YOU HEAR THEM SCREAMING, AND SOME OF THEM START TO RUN BACK.
THERE'S PYTHONS IN THAT WATER.
&gt;&gt; NO. &gt;&gt; THAT'S A LITTLE WRONG.
&gt;&gt; WHY?
OH, MY GOSH. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE SCREAMING AT THE TOP
OF THEIR LUNGS.
IT SAYS ONE OF THE INSTRUCTORS WAS LAUGHING WHILE THIS WAS
HAPPENING.
&gt;&gt; OH, MY GOSH. SO INSTEAD OF BEING MORE
CONFIDENT, THESE POOR GIRLS ARE
I THINK GO TO BE TRAUMATIZED. THIS IS AWFUL.
&gt;&gt; THIS BLEW UP ALL OVER MY
TIMELINE. PEOPLE IN ASIA HAVE BEEN GOING
CRAZY ABOUT THIS VIDEO.
IN FACT, ONE OF THE GIRLS AT ONE POINT IS SAYING, TEACHER SAVE
ME, TEACHER SAVE ME.
&gt;&gt; HOW OLD ARE THESE KIDS? ARE THESE YOUNG KIDS?
&gt;&gt; WOW.
&gt;&gt; THEY'RE SCHOOL AGE GIRLS. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO GO AND KNOCK SOME
SENSE INTO THESE PEOPLE.
THIS IS RIDICULOUS. &gt;&gt; WELL, THEY DO MAKE THE
MARINES DO THIS WHEN THEY'RE
GOING THROUGH TRAINING. &gt;&gt; AND PEOPLE ARE ABSOLUTELY
OUTRAGED.
THESE INSTRUCTORS HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED.
HERE'S THE PART THAT GETS ME.
THEY SAY THEY LEARNED ABOUT TRAINING EXERCISES ON YOUTUBE.
&gt;&gt; FROM AL QAEDA?
&gt;&gt; THEY DID APOLOGIZE.</description>

MUCH.
WE HAVE THE FORMULA OFF-ROAD CHAMPIONSHIP HERE.
THIS GUY TRYING TO CLAW HIS WAY
TO THE TOP OF THAT HILL. DOESN'T WORK.
FLIPS OVER ALMOST INSTANTLY.
BUT THE IN-CAR CAMERA SHOWS SO MUCH MORE ABOUT WHAT WENT DOWN.
YOU HEAR IT SPOOL UP, THE ENGINE
JUST ROARING, THE TIRES SCRATCHING FOR GRIP.
AND UP AND OVER, AROUND YOU GO.

THAT WAS FUN, WASN'T IT?
&gt;&gt;&gt; LET'S HEAD OVER TO YOUTUBE. OUT ON HIS DIRT BIKE.
A NICE TRAIL.
NO BIG HEROICS IN THIS FLIP. &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS THAT?
&gt;&gt; IT WAS A TREE DOWN.

      <description>HE SLOWS DOWN A LITTLE BIT.
âªâª
&gt;&gt;&gt; 10-YEAR-OLD DEVIN, HE HAS A TOOTH THAT NEEDS TO COME OUT.
HE SAID, DAD, I WANT YOU TO TAKE
IT OUT WITH A DRONE. SO OF COURSE DAD OBLIGES BECAUSE
THEY'RE MEN.
&gt;&gt; I WOULD CALL THIS A MINOR EXTRACTION.
&gt;&gt; IT IS A MINOR EXTRACTION
BECAUSE HE IS A MINOR AND THEY'RE GOING TO EXTRACT IT.
THE DRONE IS READY TO GO.
&gt;&gt; OH, NO. THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK.
&gt;&gt; YOU NEED A LONGER STRING.
&gt;&gt; OH, MY GOD. DID IT COME OUT?
&gt;&gt; YES!
&gt;&gt; IT ACTUALLY WORKED? &gt;&gt; LET'S SEE IT FROM ANOTHER
ANGLE.
&gt;&gt; OF COURSE, THE DRONE CAM. &gt;&gt; LOOK AT THE KID IN THE BACK,
LIKE, I CAN'T STICK AROUND.
&gt;&gt; OH, WOW. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT WORKED.
&gt;&gt; KIDS TODAY DON'T KNOW HOW
LUCKY THEY ARE. WHEN WE WERE KIDS, WE WOULD PUT

&gt;&gt;&gt; MY FAVORITE NEWLYWEDS EVER.
THIS VIDEO IS FULL OF YES, YES, YES.
THE BRIDE AND GROOM MET BECAUSE
OF THEIR LOVE OF MOTORCYCLES. ON THEIR WEDDING DAY, THEY SAID,
NO, NO, NO, WE'RE GOING TO DECK
OUT OUR BIKE WITH A PARTY BEHIND US.
&gt;&gt; THEY DID IT BIG.
&gt;&gt; YOU CAN SEE HER AND HER WEDDING ATTIRE ON THE
MOTORCYCLE, ALL DRESSED UP
LOOKING ALL CUTE. &gt;&gt; IN HEELS TOO.
LOOK AT HER GO.
&gt;&gt; HE ALSO STUCK TO TRADITION. APPARENTLY IT'S TRADITION IN
TURKEY WHERE THIS WEDDING TOOK
PLACE THAT THE GROOM HAND OUT BANK NOTES TO PEOPLE AFTER THE
WEDDING.
EVERY TIME HE CAME TO A STOP SIGN OR A STOPLIGHT, HE WOULD
JUST HAND THEM OUT TO OTHER
DRIVERS ON THE ROAD WITH HIM.</description>

      <description>      AND EVEN YOUR HANDS!       (MALE NARRATOR)
      THESE ARE THE AREAS
      COMMONLY REFERRED TO    AS YOUR AGEGIVEAWAY ZONES.     I WILL ALWAYS BE
    STUCK IN PEOPLE'S MINDS        AS LAURA INGALLS
       FROM LITTLE HOUSE. I'M SORT OF STUCK IN TIME AS
THIS 12 YEAR OLD GIRL, YOU KNOW,        WITH THE PIGTAILS
       AND THE PERKINESS        AND THE BUCKTEETH.      BUT I'M NOT SO YOUNG.        I'M 52 YEARS OLD,
       I'M A GRANDMA.  I USE CREPE ERASE EVERYWHERE.     MY SHOULDERS, MY ELBOWS,        MY ARMS, MY LEGS,
       EVERYWHERE,   AND IT WORKS ON EVERYTHING.  THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH
 WANTING TO BE A SEXY GRANDMA.    (MALE NARRATOR)
   THE SECRET TO CREPE ERASE         IS OUR EXCLUSIVE
        TRUFIRM COMPLEX.         AS SKIN MATURES,
        THE NETTING      THAT KEEPS SKIN YOUNG
     AND ELASTIC WEAKENS,      MAKING SKIN LOOK DRY,
     WRINKLY, AND CREPEY.     TRUFIRM'S TRIPLE COMPLEX
    OF SKIN RESTORING      PLANT ACTIVES CAN HELP
     VISIBLY TREAT  AND IMPROVE THE LOOK OF AGING
 AND SLACKENING SKIN      WHILE HELPING PROMOTE
     THE NATURAL PRODUCTION OF HEALTHY COLLAGEN AND ELASTIN.     TRUFIRM ACTUALLY
    SUPPORTS AND REINFORCES     YOUR SKIN'S OWN NETTING,        GIVING IT THAT
       YOUTHFUL SNAP BACK      SO IT LOOKS SMOOTHER,
     FIRMER, AND YOUNGER.                                âª  I'M 59, I'LL BE 60 THIS YEAR.  CREPE ERASE MAKES ME FEEL LIKE
 WHEN I LOOK IN THE MIRROR      I RECOGNIZE THAT SKIN.      I RECOGNIZE THAT SKIN
     FROM BEFORE.       AND IT FEELS YOUNGER
      AND FRESHER.  WHAT WOMAN DOESN'T WANT
 TO LOOK YOUNGER AND LOOK GOOD?     I MEAN, EVERY WOMAN
    WANTS TO LOOK HER BEST.       I FEEL BETTER
      WHEN I LOOK BETTER,   AND CREPE ERASE HAS MADE
  SUCH A DIFFERENCE IN MY SKIN       I CAN THROW MY HAIR
      BEHIND         AND SHOW MY NECK
        TO THE WORLD       AND I FEEL SEXY,
      YOUTHFUL, BEAUTIFUL.        (UPLIFTING MUSIC)                                âª       (JANE SEYMOUR)
      IF THERE IS ONE WORD
      THAT WOULD DESCRIBE       CREPE ERASE TO ME,
      THAT IS CONFIDENCE.        TOTAL CONFIDENCE.          (PHOTOGRAPHER)
         NICE! GOOD!    YOU LOOK BETTER
   AND YOUNGER AND HEALTHIER        THAN WHEN WE SHOT
       20 YEARS AGO.         (JANE SEYMOUR)
        WHO KNEW I JUST
        HAD TO AGE?         WHEN I LOOK
        AT JANE SEYMOUR     AND I SEE HER BEAUTIFUL
    SKIN AND HER CHEST,      AND HER ARMS,
     AND HER LEGS, I THINK,    "I WANT WHAT SHE'S HAVING.          I WANT THAT."        THE GREAT THING
       ABOUT CREPE ERASE    IS THAT IT'S A TREATMENT.    IT'S NOT LIKE
   I'M GOING TO BUY A LOTION     OR--OR, UM, BUY A CREAM,      IT'S A TREATMENT THAT
     REALLY, REALLY WORKS.        (FEMALE NARRATOR)
       BEST OF ALL,       CREPE ERASE STARTS
      TO WORK IMMEDIATELY    AFTER YOUR VERY FIRST USE!    AND IN JUST 60 DAYS,
   TRULY ASTONISHING RESULTS           LIKE THESE!    THE RESULTS I GOT
   AFTER JUST ONE APPLICATION  OF CREPE ERASE WAS MIRACULOUS.    NOW THE RESULTS ARE JUST
   GETTING BETTER AND BETTER.    (MALE NARRATOR)
   AND NOW, SHARING HER OWN
   CREPE ERASE SUCCESS STORY         WITH OUR LIVE
        STUDIO AUDIENCE.     (FEMALE NARRATOR)
    SHE'S EVERYONE'S
    FAVORITE MEDICINE WOMAN.      (MALE NARRATOR)
     PLEASE WELCOME MOTHER,
     GRANDMOTHER,      AND EMMY AWARD WINNING
     ACTRESS JANE SEYMOUR!       (CHEERING, APPLAUSE)                                âª         (JANE SEYMOUR)
        HELLO! WELCOME!        WELCOME, EVERYONE,
       AND THANK YOU!         SO WHAT EXACTLY
        IS CREPEY SKIN?       IT'S THOSE WRINKLES
      ON YOUR CHEST   CALLED "FOUNTAIN LINES"
  OR THE CRINKLY OLD LADY SKIN      ON YOUR ARMS AND LEGS.      OR THOSE NECK CREASES
     SOMETIMES REFERRED TO          AS A NECKLACE.        NOT MY FAVORITE
       TYPE OF NECKLACE.           (CHUCKLING)   IN FACT, CREPEY SKIN
  CAN BE OUTRIGHT DEPRESSING.    BUT HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS,        FINALLY, THERE IS
       A REAL SOLUTION       TO IMPROVE THE LOOK
      OF CREPEY SKIN,    AND IT'S CALLED,
   QUITE PERFECTLY ACTUALLY,           CREPE ERASE.   AND IF YOU THINK THIS IS
  JUST ANOTHER CREAM OR LOTION       THAT ONLY MASKS
      OR HIDES THE PROBLEM     OF CREPEY LOOKING SKIN,           THINK AGAIN!      AND HERE'S THE PROOF!          THESE ARE 100%
         REAL RESULTS.        NO FANCY LIGHTING
       OR CAMERA TRICKS.         I MEAN, LOOK AT
        THIS ARM BEFORE      AND AFTER CREPE ERASE.       AND DÃCOLLETÃ BEFORE
      AND NOW HERE, AFTER.      ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE!         AND LOOK AT HOW
        CREPE ERASE      ACTUALLY APPEARS
     TO TRANSFORM THE SKIN           ON THIS LEG.           NOW YOU SEE
          CREPEY SKIN,          NOW YOU DON'T!       TRULY, HAVE YOU EVER
      SEEN RESULTS      LIKE THIS BEFORE
     WITHOUT ANY PROCEDURES       OR DOCTORS' VISITS?    I MEAN, IT'S ASTONISHING,    WHICH IS WHY I LIKE TO SAY
   WITH CREPE ERASE,         YOU CAN REVEAL
        MORE OF YOURSELF   WITHOUT REVEALING YOUR AGE.  (DARA TORRES)
 I STARTED TRAINING AGAIN FOR
 THE OLYMPICS IN MY EARLY 40S.        AND THERE I WAS
       IN MY BATHING SUIT      WITH CREPEY SKIN
     ON MY NECK AND MY ARMS       AND AROUND MY KNEES
      AND UPPER LEGS.       MY SKIN LOOKED OLDER
      THAN MY AGE.       UNTIL I STARTED
      TO USE CREPE ERASE.     UH, LOOKIT NOW, I MEAN,    I'M IN THIS DRESS
   AND I FEEL SO COMFORTABLE   BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE MY SKIN
  IS KIND OF SHINY      AND IT'S VERY HYDRATED        AND I JUST FEEL
       LIKE I LOOK GOOD.     MY MOTHER USED TO SAY
    TO ME WHEN I WAS A KID, "IF YOU EVER WANT TO SEE HOW OLD
A WOMAN IS, LOOK AT HER NECK."   AND SO I'VE BEEN SO FOCUSED
  ON MY NECK FOR SO LONG.     AND TO SEE
    THESE KINDS OF RESULTS,   SIMPLY BY USING CREPE ERASE,       IT'S AMAZING TO ME.        I WILL NEVER STOP
       USING CREPE ERASE.       THE FIRST TIME
      I TRIED CREPE ERASE,        I--I WAS SHOCKED.        IMMEDIATELY
       I SAW A DIFFERENCE     ON MY NECK, ON MY CHEST,       MY ELBOWS, MY KNEES,      THE BACKS OF MY HANDS.      EVERYWHERE WAS
     COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.         CREPE ERASE
        HAS DONE SO MUCH          FOR MY CHEST,   MY LEGS, ME ELBOWS, MY FEET.    IT'S--IT'S BEEN A MIRACLE
   IN MY LIFE.         I'M ABOUT TO HIT
        THAT 50 MARK.    50 THESE DAYS IS FABULOUS,     AND I'M STARTING
    TO FEEL THAT WAY AGAIN.      (JANE SEYMOUR)
     SHORTLY AFTER I BEGAN
     USING CREPE ERASE,      WE HAD THIS CRAZY IDEA
     TO HAVE ME    PUT THIS BIKINI ON
   THEN TAKE SOME PHOTOGRAPHS          ON THE BEACH.         WHY WOULD I POSE
        IN A BIKINI      AT THE AGE OF 62? WHY?   I MEAN, WHAT AN INSANE IDEA.       I DIDN'T WANT
      TO POSE IN A BIKINI          WHEN I WAS 17,
         SO WHY NOW?        AND I DON'T THINK
       I WOULD'VE DONE IT        IF I HADN'T BEEN
       USING CREPE ERASE.       I FEEL THAT USING
      CREPE ERASE MAKES-- IT JUST MAKES ME FEEL
LIKE I'M TURNING BACK THE CLOCK. THE FIRST TIME I SAW THE BEFORE
AND AFTERS OF CREPE ERASE, I HONESTLY FELT LIKE,
"THESE ARE TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE."        THEN I STARTED
       USING CREPE ERASE       ON MYSELF
      AND ON MY PATIENTS,      AND THAT'S WHEN I KNEW
     THAT CREPE ERASE         WAS A REALLY
        SPECIAL PRODUCT.    (MALE NARRATOR)
   THE SECRET TO CREPE ERASE         IS OUR EXCLUSIVE
        TRUFIRM COMPLEX.         AS SKIN MATURES,
        THE NETTING      THAT KEEPS SKIN YOUNG

    I WENT THROUGH
    BREAST CANCER LAST YEAR.     I MEAN, EVERYBODY HEARS
    YOU LOSE YOUR HAIR   AND ALL THAT KIND OF THING,      BUT I'D NEVER HEARD
     OR EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT        HOW DRY MY SKIN
       WOULD HAVE BECOME,     GOING THROUGH RADIATION
    AND ALL THAT.      MY SKIN WAS JUST GROSS      AND LIKE DRY AND FLAKY
     AND, YOU KNOW,    MINI LITTLE WRINKLE LINES.      AND IT WAS DEPRESSING.    ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE
   I WAS GOING--     YOU KNOW, GOING THROUGH,       I JUST KIND OF FELT
      LIKE I LOOKED 90.    NOTHING WORKED FOR MY DRY,
   CREPEY SKIN.       THE VERY FIRST TIME
      I GOT HOME,       I TRIED CREPE ERASE
      THAT NIGHT.      AND MY SKIN
     WAS LIKE REJUVENATED.     I MEAN, LIKE RIGHT AWAY.    IT'S JUST GOOD TO KIND OF FEEL GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF AGAIN.     THESE ARE TEARS OF JOY.    (JANE SEYMOUR)
   CREPE ERASE IS DIFFERENT,   AND, MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL,            IT WORKS. HERE'S YOUR CHANCE TO EXPERIENCE
CREPE ERASE RIGHT NOW.        (FEMALE NARRATOR)
       NOW, JUST IN TIME
       FOR SUMMER...        (MALE NARRATOR)
       YOU CAN WIPE AWAY
       THE APPEARANCE       OF WRINKLY, CRINKLY,       CREPEY SKIN,
      REVEALING SMOOTHER,  TIGHTER, PLUMPER LOOKING SKIN       THAT MAKES YOU LOOK
      AND FEEL YOUNGER.      INTRODUCING
     THE CREPE ERASE SYSTEM          WITH TRUFIRM.     (FEMALE NARRATOR)
    A BREAKTHROUGH
    IN SKIN CARE INNOVATION    THE BEAUTY INDUSTRY HAS
   SPENT YEARS SEARCHING FOR.        I HAVE TRIED EVERY
       MOISTURIZER,     LOTION, POTION THERE IS.         AND YOU KNOW...      NOTHING REALLY HELPS. AFTER A FEW DAYS OF CREPE ERASE, I WAS THINKING,
"WOW, THIS IS REALLY DIFFERENT."        AND I LOOKED DOWN
       AT MY KNEES,      AND I REALIZED THAT
     THEY LOOKED DIFFERENT,      AND THIS WAS WORKING!          IT WAS DOING
         SOMETHING THAT        THE OTHER PRODUCTS
       HAD NEVER DONE.        I'M 49 YEARS OLD,  I HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO THE SUN    AND THE CHLORINE IN WATER       SINCE I WAS A BABY.    I'VE TRIED EVERY POSSIBLE
   LOTION, CREAM,       THICKEST BODY BUTTER

  I FINALLY FOUND A TREATMENT   LIKE CREPE ERASE THAT WORKS,    THAT CAN HELP MY SKIN
   AND MAKE ME LOOK YOUNGER.       CREPE ERASE HAS BEEN
      LIFE SAVING FOR ME.      (MALE NARRATOR)

    GLOWING SUMMER SKIN    THE FIRST TIME YOU USE IT.     AND WITH CONTINUED USE,     THE RESULTS ARE NOTHING
    SHORT OF ASTONISHING!     I'VE BEEN GIVING
    MY PATIENTS CREPE ERASE   FOR ABOUT A YEAR NOW,
  AND THEY'RE RAVING ABOUT IT.         I CAN'T KEEP IT
        IN MY OFFICE.       THEY WANT TO GIVE IT
      TO THEIR FRIENDS.      THEY WANT TO HOARD IT
     FOR THEMSELVES.   EVERYBODY LOVES CREPE ERASE.     (MALE NARRATOR)

    AND NOW I AM SO EXCITED
    TO INTRODUCE YOU     TO THE WOMAN RESPONSIBLE
    FOR BRINGING US       THIS REMARKABLE
      CREPE ERASE PRODUCT.      PLEASE WELCOME
     A DEAR FRIEND OF MINE,           KIM PARRISH!      THANK YOU, JANE,
     IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE.            (APPLAUSE)   (JANE SEYMOUR)
  KIM, YOU'RE A BEAUTY EXPERT.  YOU'VE BEEN FEATURED
 IN COUNTLESS BEAUTY MAGAZINES.   YOU KNOW, YOU'RE THE EXPERT
  ON ALL OF THIS.   HOW DID YOU DISCOVER THIS
  BREAKTHROUGH BEAUTY PRODUCT?       (KIM PARRISH)
      WHEN I TURNED 40
      I STARTED TO NOTICE     CREPEY SKIN ON MY CHEST,
    ON MY ARMS,  AND WELL, EVEN ABOVE MY KNEES.      I WAS SO FRUSTRATED
     BECAUSE I HAVE ACCESS       TO SO MANY DIFFERENT
      TYPES OF PRODUCTS     THAT ARE OUT THERE,
    AND YET, I COULDN'T FIND   ANYTHING THAT WAS EFFECTIVE
  IN TREATING CREPEY SKIN,      UNTIL FINALLY I FOUND
     CREPE ERASE.   (JANE SEYMOUR)
  NOW KIM, THESE ARE YOUR OWN
  BEFORE AND AFTER PICTURES     WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW.       I MEAN, THE RESULTS
      ON YOUR LEG         FROM CREPE ERASE
        ARE ASTOUNDING!    THEY'RE TRULY INCREDIBLE.   (KIM PARRISH)
  IT WAS BETTER THAN ANYTHING      THAT I EVER EXPECTED.    THIS IS THE FIRST PRODUCT
   I'VE EVER USED       WHERE I REALLY FEEL
      THAT IT APPEARS         TO VISIBLY PLUMP     AND GIVE MY SKIN VOLUME.      WELL, PLUMP AND VOLUME
     ARE GREAT WAYS      TO DESCRIBE EXACTLY
     WHAT CREPE ERASE DOES.      LET ME SHOW YOU
     A QUICK DEMONSTRATION    OF EXACTLY WHAT I MEAN
   ON THESE SLICES OF DOUGH.         YEAH, WELL,
        LIKE YOUR SKIN,     DOUGH IS SUSCEPTIBLE
    TO DRYING AND CRACKING,       AND LOSING MOISTURE.          SO WHAT I HAVE
         IN FRONT OF ME          ARE TWO SLICES
         OF DOUGH.       ONE HAS BEEN TREATED
      WITH CREPE ERASE          FOR FOUR DAYS,       AND THE OTHER HASN'T
      BEEN TREATED AT ALL.    NOW, TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.     WHEN I TOUCH THE DOUGH
    THAT HASN'T BEEN TREATED        WITH CREPE ERASE,        IT'S ACTUALLY DRY
       AND CRUMBLY.    YOU CAN SEE IT'S FLAKING.      AND WHEN I GO TO PULL
     IT APART,          THERE ARE DEEP
         CREVICES,    VERY SIMILAR
   TO CREVICES YOU MIGHT FIND          IN AGING SKIN.      THERE'S NO SNAP BACK,        THERE'S NO BOUNCE.        AND IN FACT,
       THERE'S ABSOLUTELY          NO ELASTICITY.    NOW, TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.      THIS IS THE DOUGH
     THAT HAS BEEN TREATED         WITH CREPE ERASE
        FOR FOUR DAYS.         AS YOU CAN SEE,
        AND I CAN FEEL,      IT'S INCREDIBLY MOIST.           IT'S SUPPLE,
          AND IN FACT,          IT'S ELASTIC.       IT HAS THAT BOUNCE,
      THAT SNAP BACK,     LIKE YOUTHFUL SKIN HAS.         THIS IS EXACTLY
        WHAT HAPPENS    TO YOUR SKIN
   WHEN YOU USE CREPE ERASE.     CREPE ERASE RECONDITIONS
    YOUR SKIN       SO THAT IT'S TIGHTER
      AND FIRMER,        AND IT'S PLUMPER,       AND IT FEELS LIKE
      IT HAS MORE VOLUME.          IT LOOKS LIKE
         YOUNGER SKIN.      (JANE SEYMOUR)
     IT'S JUST INCREDIBLE!         I MEAN, LOOK AT
        THE DIFFERENCE       BETWEEN THE DOUGH
      THAT WASN'T TREATED         WITH CREPE ERASE
        VERSUS THE DOUGH        THAT WAS TREATED
       WITH CREPE ERASE.    THE DIFFERENCE
   COULDN'T BE MORE OBVIOUS.     AND THAT IS WHY WE'RE
    ALL EXPERIENCING RESULTS       THAT ARE ABSOLUTELY
      MIND-BOGGLING.     CREPE ERASE IS DIFFERENT  THAN ANY OTHER BODY TREATMENT
 I HAVE EVER SEEN      BECAUSE IT'S
     SPECIFICALLY TARGETED         FOR CREPEY SKIN
        ON THE BODY.    CREPE ERASE REALLY WORKS,    IT WORKS FAST,
   AND IT WORKS REALLY WELL.     AND THAT'S WHY
    I RECOMMEND CREPE ERASE      TO MY PATIENTS
     WHO HAVE CREPEY SKIN.  I'LL NEVER FORGET, UM,
 AFTER I DELIVERED MY DAUGHTER,     I SWAM IN A MEET
    ABOUT THREE WEEKS LATER,     HAD TO PUT A SWIMSUIT ON    AND BE AROUND
   SOME OF THESE YOUNG KIDS.  AND IT WAS VERY INTIMIDATING.      THEY HAVE NO AGE SPOTS
     AND NO CREPEY-NESS.     AND I'M LOOKING
    AT MYSELF AND I'M LIKE,         "WHOA, YOU KNOW,
        I'M DEFINITELY        20, 30 YEARS OLDER
       THAN THESE KIDS."          AND IT SHOWS.        THE GREAT THING
       ABOUT CREPE ERASE    IS THAT IT'S A TREATMENT.     IT'S NOT LIKE I'M GOING
    TO BUY A LOTION     OR--OR, UM, BUY A CREAM.    IT'S A TREATMENT
   THAT REALLY, REALLY WORKS.   CREPE ERASE IS A TREATMENT.     IT'S NOT A BODY LOTION.      IT'S A SKIN TREATMENT.        LOOK AT THE OUTFIT
       I'M WEARING NOW.      I NEVER WOULD
     HAVE WORN THIS BEFORE.         I'M SPEECHLESS.  IT'S JUST ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.         I'M 63 YEARS OLD        AND MY ARMS
       BEFORE CREPE ERASE        WERE VERY CRINKLY
       AND OLD LOOKING.      MADE ME FEEL OLD TOO.      AND NOW SINCE
     I'VE USED CREPE ERASE,        THE SKIN
       IS JUST BEAUTIFUL.    I MEAN, I'VE NOTICED EVEN      THE CLOTHES THAT
     I WEAR ARE DIFFERENT.  I'M EXPOSING MORE OF MY SKIN.     SINCE CREPE ERASE,
    I LOVE THE SKIN I'M IN.    CREPE ERASE IS MIRACULOUS. IT'S THE MOST PHENOMENAL PRODUCT
I'VE EVER USED.      IT DOES EXACTLY WHAT
     IT SAYS IT'S GONNA DO.       CREPE ERASE
      WORKS LIKE A DREAM.       I WON THE GOLD MEDAL
      IN 1976.       I WAS 19 YEARS OLD,
      I WAS A KID!   AND NOW, TODAY,
  PEOPLE MEET ME AND THEY GO,  "YOU CAN'T BE DOROTHY HAMILL."       WHEN I FIRST NOTICED
      THE CREPEY SKIN      I REMEMBERED THINKING,
     "OH MY GOODNESS,          THIS IS MY MOM    OR THIS IS MY GRANDMOTHER.    OR THIS IS THE OLD PEOPLE
   THAT I'VE SEEN WITH,      YOU KNOW, CREPEY SKIN.        AND NOW IT'S ME."   CREPE ERASE MAKES ME FEEL
  LIKE I HAVE YOUNG LADY SKIN    INSTEAD OF OLD LADY SKIN.       AFTER HAVING TRIED,
      I THINK,          EVERY PRODUCT
         ON THE PLANET,    FINDING CREPE ERASE
   AND HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY    TO USE IT, IT'S CHANGED--
   IT'S CHANGED EVERYTHING.   (FEMALE NARRATOR)

      SO I WAS OUTDOORS       ALL THE TIME
      IN THE SUMMER TIME.   AND I DIDN'T USE
  SUNSCREEN WHEN I SHOULD'VE, AND TIME MARCHES ON,
AND HERE COMES THE CREPEY SKIN.      I COVERED MY SKIN UP,
     ESPECIALLY WHEN I WAS       AROUND OTHER PEOPLE.        WHEN I LOOK AT
       MY BEFORE PICTURE,       IT, UM...I HATE IT.         IT'S DEPRESSING.        UNDERNEATH IT ALL
       YOU'RE JUST--     YOU JUST FEEL DEFEATED,    AND YOU CAN'T REVERSE IT.     AT LEAST, NOT UNTIL NOW.      THE AFTER PICTURE
     LOOKS 20 YEARS YOUNGER     THAN THE BEFORE PICTURE.     AND THERE'S ONLY, LIKE,
    A 60 DAY DIFFERENCE.     LOOK AT THE SMOOTHNESS,
    LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE.   I CAN WEAR A PAIR OF SHORTS,
  I CAN WEAR A SKIRT,       I CAN WEAR A DRESS.
      I CAN GO SLEEVELESS.        THIS SKIN IS FIRM,
       IT'S TIGHT,           IT'S SMOOTH.   IT FEELS WONDERFUL
  TO HAVE MY SKIN BACK AGAIN.     IT'S GIVEN ME A WHOLE
    NEW LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE       THAT I HAVEN'T FELT
      IN A VERY LONG TIME.      IT IS VERY EMOTIONAL.     I CANNOT SAY ENOUGH GOOD
    ABOUT CREPE ERASE.          I AM WALKING,
         LIVING PROOF     THAT CREPE ERASE WORKS.         PURE AND SIMPLE,
        IT WORKS.     (MALE NARRATOR)
    CREPE ERASE IS DIFFERENT     BECAUSE IT SPECIFICALLY
    TARGETS THE CREPEY SKIN       ON YOUR NECK, CHEST, ARMS, LEGS, AND EVEN YOUR HANDS.        (FEMALE NARRATOR)

   ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS
   TO DEAL WITH        WHEN YOU'RE AGING
       IS WHEN YOUR SKIN   STARTS GETTING REALLY CREPEY       AND YOU GET
      THAT OLD LADY LOOK.    YOU KNOW, THERE ARE A TON
   OF PRODUCTS OUT THERE.       I DIDN'T REALLY SEE        A MAJOR DIFFERENCE
       IN ANY OF THEM.   AND I DIDN'T EXPECT ANYTHING
  WHEN I TRIED CREPE ERASE,       AND THEN THE AMAZING
      THING HAPPENED.    PUTTING CREPE ERASE ON,
   SUDDENLY MY SKIN LOOKED--      IT JUST LOOKED FIRMER,
     IT WAS LESS CREPEY,       YOU KNOW, I USED IT
      ON MY KNEES,    AND I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.     I MEAN, JUST ABSOLUTELY
    SMOOTH, AND, YOU KNOW,         AMAZING TEXTURE.       I FEEL COMFORTABLE,
      AND I FEEL BEAUTIFUL         IN MY OWN SKIN.        THE BEST THING
       ABOUT CREPE ERASE,       AND THE BEST THING
      THAT I'VE DISCOVERED        FROM PEOPLE WHO'VE
       BEEN USING IT,           IS THEY HAVE
          CONFIDENCE,        AND THEY FEEL GOOD
       ABOUT THEMSELVES,       AND THEY FEEL HAPPY.    AND AT THE END OF THE DAY,
   WHAT IS LIFE ABOUT?            HAPPINESS.                                âª      FOR THE PAST 15 YEARS,     I HAVE TRIED A NUMBER
    OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES      TO TREAT CREPEY SKIN,         BUT THEY CAN BE
        VERY EXPENSIVE       AND, YOU KNOW,
      SOMETIMES THEY HURT        WHEN YOU DO THEM.   AND SO A LOT OF MY PATIENTS,     I'VE BEEN GIVING WHEN
    THEY'VE BEEN COMPLAINING       OF THE CREPEY SKIN,
      THE CREPE ERASE.  AND LIKE THE BEFORE AND AFTER
 PICTURES YOU SAW BEFORE,       I WAS SEEING
      THOSE EXACT RESULTS         IN MY PRACTICE
        WITH MY CLIENTS.       AND LET ME TELL YOU,
      THEY ARE ECSTATIC.   IT REALLY DOES WORK AS WELL
  AS THE PICTURES SHOW.       CREPE ERASE
      HAS CHANGED THE WAY       I FEEL ABOUT MY SKIN        AND ABOUT MYSELF.      I DIDN'T THINK
     THAT THAT WAS POSSIBLE       SHORT OF, YOU KNOW,      SURGERY OR--OR LASERS
     OR SOMETHING.   AND TO SEE THESE KINDS
  OF RESULTS THAT I'M GETTING       FROM SIMPLY
      USING THIS PRODUCT,    THIS CREPE ERASE THAT IS--      IT'S SO SIMPLE TO USE,      IT'S STUNNING TO ME,
     IT'S REALLY STUNNING.     WELL, I'M 58 YEARS OLD,
    AND I'M PROUD OF IT.         AND I LIKE BEING
        58 YEARS OLD.      AND WITH CREPE ERASE,
     IT'S ONE THING     I DON'T HAVE
    TO WORRY ABOUT ANYMORE.     I KNOW MY SKIN
    LOOKS AS GOOD AS IT CAN.        CREPE ERASE
       IS THE ONE PRODUCT        THAT WORKS FOR ME,       IT DOES WHAT IT SAYS
      IT'S GOING TO DO.         I LOVE THE FACT
        THAT CREPE ERASE    BRINGS OUT
   A WOMAN'S NATURAL BEAUTY.  IT ALLOWS ME
 TO BE THE BEST THAT I CAN BE.        IT'S SO REFRESHING
       TO FIND A PRODUCT        THAT FINALLY DOES
       WHAT IT PROMISES.      CREPE ERASE DELIVERS.     (JORDAN)
    WHEN YOU'RE FEELING GOOD
    AND YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD,    YOU KNOW, WHO KNOWS
   WHAT'S AROUND THE CORNER.        I HAVE TOLD
       ALL OF MY FRIENDS,      MY SISTER,
     MY FRIENDS BACK EAST,       MY FRIENDS LOCALLY.    I TELL THEM,
   "FEEL MY SKIN, SERIOUSLY.        COME ON, FEEL MY--
       FEEL MY ARMS.       YOU WON'T BELIEVE
      HOW SOFT THEY ARE."       THIS IS THE NEW ME.   I FEEL YOUNGER, I'M HAPPIER
  SINCE CREPE ERASE.    THEY'VE SOLD ME FOR LIFE.     I DID ALL, LIKE,
    OVER THE COUNTER STUFF.       I DID STUFF
      FROM DERMATOLOGISTS.   I MEAN, I TRIED EVERYTHING.     TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST,  I USED CREPE ERASE EVERYWHERE
 FROM MY NECK DOWN.         IT REALLY WORKS.      CREPE ERASE
     REALLY, REALLY WORKS.       THERE COMES A POINT
      IN HOLLYWOOD,     USUALLY WHEN YOU'RE 40,
    WHERE THEY BASICALLY         WRITE YOU OFF
        AND YOU'RE DONE.       AND I'M LOOKING AT
      MYSELF IN THE MIRROR     AND I'M GOING,
    WAIT A MINUTE, YOU KNOW,    I'M ACTUALLY IN MY PRIME.    SO LET'S DO ALL THE THINGS
   THAT I'M EXCITED BY.       LET ME GO OUT,
      LET ME WEAR THE KIND    OF CLOTHES I WANT TO WEAR.         LET ME FEEL GOOD
        ABOUT MY BODY.     I DON'T HAVE TO GIVE UP.     AND, YOU KNOW,
    MY SKIN IS JUST NOT DONE          LOOKING YOUNG,
         IT'S JUST NOT.      IT'S GONNA BE WITH ME
     FOR A WHILE.        (FEMALE NARRATOR)

    SUPPORTS AND REINFORCES     YOUR SKIN'S OWN NETTING,        GIVING IT THAT

 AND ONLY SYSTEM WITH TRUFIRM,       DESIGNED TO ACTUALLY
      SOLVE THE PROBLEM         OF CREPEY SKIN.     (FEMALE NARRATOR)

      BODY POLISH.       THIS GENTLE
      YET POWERFUL POLISH         SWEEPS AWAY

THAT'S NOT GOING TO HELP HIM.
&gt;&gt; Daniel: CHRIS WALLACE ALSO ADDRESSED RECENT CHALLENGES FOR
EACH CANDIDATE INCLUDING
ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT AND TRUMP SAYS IT IS TOTALLY
FALSE AND NEVER APOLOGIZED TO
HIS WIFE BECAUSE HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

POWER POLE DANGLING WITHIN AMONG
THE POWER LINES OVER THIS INTERSECTION AND POWER POLE AND
EXPRESSWAY STILL GOING ON THE
BRAINTREE SPLIT UP TO COLUMBIA ROAD AND JAMPACKED AS YOU HEAD
PAST EXIT 13 FREEPORT STREET.
HERE ARE LIVE DRIVE TIMES, 40 MINUTES ON THE PIKE EASTBOUND
FROM 495 TO MASS AVE.
HALF HOUR ON EXPRESSWAY, HOUR AND FIVE, HOUR AND TEN MINUTES
128 SOUTHBOUND FROM PEABODY TO
THE WESTON TOLLS. GENE AND SARA, BACK TO YOU.
&gt;&gt; Gene: WE ARE GOING TO GET
RAIN. &gt;&gt; Shiri: HUGE RAIN RELIEF,
NOT TOO MUCH COMING TODAY AND
TOMORROW GOT SOAKING RAIN BY LATE IN THE DAY, GOING TO HELP
OUT THIS SITUATION AND DROUGHT
MONITOR AND GETS UPDATED ONCE A WEEK, 8:30, UPDATE COMES OUT AND
SITUATION TODAY WILL BE
MAINTAINING OUR CURRENT CONDITION AND MASSACHUSETTS
DROUGHT GETTING WORSE AND OTHER
PARTS OF NEW ENGLAND AND DRY WEATHER HAS JUST CONTINUED, SO
EXTREME DROUGHT STILL FOR OVER
30% OF THE DATA. LOOKING AT POTENTIAL FOR HALF
INCH TO INCH OF RAIN AND MORE
THAN THAT IN EASTERN MASSACHUSETTS WHERE WE HAVE THE
BEST SHOT OF GETTING SOME
TROPICAL LIKE DOWNPOURS. RIGHT NOW A LITTLE BUBBLE OF
HIGH PRESSURE KEEPING US NICE
AND CLEAR THIS MORNING BUT YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE THE WEATHER
MAKER AND COMFORTABLE CONDITIONS
IN LOW AND MID-60s AND TOSS IN COUPLE MORE CLOUDS, STILL PARTLY
SUNNY THOUGH AND INITIALLY HIGH,
THIN CLOUDS AND MILKY AND KIND OF BRIGHT AND THEN THEY GRAY
OVER AS WE WORK OUR WAY TOWARD
THE EVENING COMMUTE. TEMPERATURES IN LOWER 60s
MIGHT HAVE YOU WITH THE WINDOW
DOWN HEADED HOME AND DRY 5:00 P.M. AND 8:00 P.M. SEEING
THE SHOWERS SNEAK UP AND LATER
THAN THAT PLAN ON WET CONDITIONS.
62 IN BOSTON, 63 IN LAWRENCE AND
67 IN NORWOOD AND 67 IN FITCHBURG, SO THERE ARE WARM
SPOTS OUT THERE, 60s TODAY,
70s TOMORROW AND MAYBE THE WARM-UP SOUNDS FANTASTIC BUT IT
IS GOING TO BE MUGGY, IT IS
GOING TO BE MILD, GOING TO BE WET AND TRACKING SCATTERED
SHOWERS ESSENTIAL THROUGHOUT THE
DAY, POCKETS OF HEAVY RAIN WITHIN THEM AND HEAVIEST
STEADIEST STUFF IS AS THIS FRONT
WORKS ITS WAY ACROSS THE AREA. IT IS MERGING WITH THIS KIND OF
TROPICAL MOISTURE AND THAT'S
WHAT'S REALLY GOING TO BRING FRIDAY NIGHT INTO EARLIER
SATURDAY MORNING AND FOLLOW MORE
SHOWERS ON SATURDAY. SATURDAY THE CLOUDS ARE GOING TO
HAVE TO HAVE TOUGH TIME BREAKING
APART, 59Â°. WE HAVE BREEZY CONDITIONS AND
TRYING TO MAKE SOME WEEKEND
PLANS, JUST UNDERSTAND AND COOL AND BREEZY AND BRIGHTER ON
SUNDAY PUSH TOWARD THE SUNDAY
FORECAST WHERE WE HAVE ABOUT 55 IN BOSTON, 50 IN WORCESTER, 54
NASHUA AND 57Â° IN PLYMOUTH,
MONDAY MORNING WAKING UP TO SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THEN WE
WILL SEE THINGS BRIGHTEN UP BY
THE END OF THE DAY, LOWS IN THE 30s AND HIGHS IN THE 50s
RULING NEXT WEEK.
BACK TO YOU. &gt;&gt; Sara: ATLANTIC STATES
MARINE FISHERIES WILL SEND
STRATEGIES TO CONSIDERATION. THOSE MEASURES COULD INCLUDE
SEASONABLE CLOSURES AND CHANGING

BACK IN BUSINESS AFTER BEING
SHUT DOWN FOR HEALTH CODE VIOLATIONS AND GAVE THE LOCATION
IN DOWNTOWN CROSSING THE GREEN
LIGHT TO REOPEN FOR LUNCH YESTERDAY.
JUST ONE DAY AFTER IT WAS
CLOSED. INSPECTORS SAY THE RESTAURANT
WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND TO FIX THE
ISSUES. &gt;&gt; VERY REPUTABLE AND SHORT
ORDER AND WE GO FORTH THE NEXT
FEW DAYS. &gt;&gt; THE CHAIN'S BOYLSTON STREET
LOCATION WAS CLOSED FOR SIMILAR
PROBLEMS EARLIER THIS SUMMER. &gt;&gt; Gene: LAST DITCH EFFORT FOR
NEW CASINO IN EVERETT DOESN'T

COMMITTEE FOR THE VOTE AND SPENT $40,000 FOR MAILERS AND
AUTOMATED PHONE CALLS FOR
REVERE'S MAYOR URGING VOTERS TO VOTE AGAINST THE PROPOSAL.

THE STREETS OF PROVINCETOWN CAPE COD TIMES REPORTS THAT P TOWN
RESIDENTS AND BUSINESS OWNERS
ARE TRYING TO GET THE BOARD OF SELECTMEN ABOUT ALL THE STREET
PERFORMERS SET UP SHOP DURING
THE SUMMER MONTHS. ONE WOMAN IN PARTICULAR DREW IRE
FROM THE CROWD AND OPRAH --
OPERA SINGER AND STREET PERFORMERS ARE PROTECTED FROM
FREE SPEECH.
A NOISE LEVEL BY LAW WOULD APPLY TO RESTAURANTS AND BARS.
BOSTON CITY COUNCILORS WANT TO
REGULATE SHORT-TERM HOUSING RENTALS LIKE AIRBNB.
YESTERDAY COUNSELORS MEANT TO
REQUEST A HEARING ON THIS ISSUE. SOME RESIDENTS SAY THE SERVICE
CAN DISRUPT A NEIGHBORHOOD
LETTING PEOPLE COME AND GO FROM HOMES.
ONCE THE HEARING IS SCHEDULED
INDUSTRY EXPERTS AND RESIDENTS WILL BE ASKED TO HELP WITH
POSSIBLE REGULATIONS.
EARLIER THIS YEAR LAWMAKERS FAILED TO PASS TAXES ON AIRBNB
RENTALS.

      <description>LAST TIME.
&gt;&gt; Sara:  LAST NIGHT'S DEBATE
STARTED OFF MORE FOCUSED ON THE ISSUE INSTEAD OF PERSONAL
ATTACKS AND TRUMP MADE A
STATEMENT THAT CHANGED THE NIGHT, AND EVEN LEFT SOME OF
HIS SUPPORTERS SPEECHLESS.
FOX25'S DANIEL MILLER IS LIVE WITH MORE.
DANIEL.
&gt;&gt; Daniel:  THIS MORNING DONALD TRUMP IS REFUSING TO SAY
WHETHER OR NOT HE WILL ACCEPT
THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION. IF HE LOSES ON NOVEMBER 8.
TAKE A LISTEN TO THE EXCHANGE
WITH MODERATOR CHRIS WALLACE. &gt;&gt; I WILL LOOK AT IT AT THE
TIME.
I AM NOT LOOKING AT ANYTHING NOW.
I WILL LOOK AT IT AT THE TIME.
&gt;&gt; THE LOSER CONCEDES TO THE WINNER AND THAT THE COUNTRY
COMES TOGETHER IN PART FOR THE
GOOD OF THE COUNTRY. ARE YOU SAYING YOU ARE NOT
PREPARED --
&gt;&gt; WHAT I AM SAYING I WILL TELL YOU AT THE TIME.
I WILL KEEP YOU IN SUSPENSE.
&gt;&gt; WALLACE TOLD TRUMP THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PEACEFUL TRANSFER
OF POWER AFTER AMERICAN
ELECTIONS. AFTER THE DEBATE HILLARY
CLINTON CALLED A HORRIBLE THING
TO SAY AND TRUMP REPEATED HIS IDEA THAT THE ELECTION IS
RIGGED.
HIS OWN DAUGHTER AND VICE VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE
MIKE PENCE SAID THE TRUMP
CAMPAIGN WILL ACCEPT THE RESULTS.
THE DEBATE TURNED MORE PERSONAL
WHEN THE TWO CANDIDATES CLASHED OVER THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE'S
RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIAN
PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN. &gt;&gt; WITH EVERYTHING I SEE HAS NO
RESPECT FOR THIS PERSON.
&gt;&gt; WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE HE WOULD RATHER HAVE A PUPPET AS
PRESIDENT IN THE UNITED STATES.
&gt;&gt; NO PUPPET. YOU ARE THE PUPPET.
&gt;&gt; PRETTY CLEAR YOU WON'T ADMIT
THAT THE RUSSIANS HAVE ENGAGED IN CYBER ATTACKS AGAINST THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
THAT YOU ENCOURAGED ESPIONAGE AGAINST OUR PEOPLE.
&gt;&gt; Daniel:  ONE OF THE FINAL
MOMENTS OF THE DEBATE CLINTON WAS ASKING A QUESTION HOW SHE
WOULD RAISE TAXES ON THE RICH
TO TACKLE DEBT AND MADE A QUICK JAB AT TRUMP FOR NOT PAYING
FEDERAL TAXES AND HE HIT BACK.
&gt;&gt; MY SOCIAL SECURITY PAYROLL CONTRIBUTION WILL GO UP AS WILL
DONALD'S, ASSUMING HE CAN'T
FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET OUT OF IT.
BUT WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS
REPLENISH -- &gt;&gt; SUCH A NASTY WOMAN.
&gt;&gt; THOUGHT THE DEBATE,
MODERATOR CHRIS WALLACE KEPT THE CANDIDATES REINED AND
WASN'T STEAMROLLED BY EITHER OF
THEM, YOU CNN AND ORC CONDUCTED THEIR POST DEBATE POLL WITH
VIEWERS.
52% SAY HILLARY CLINTON WON. 39% FAVORED DONALD TRUMP.
FOX25 BLAIR MILLER WAS IN LAS
VEGAS FOR THE DEBATE AND WE WILL HEAR FROM HIM IN 30
MINUTES.
DANIEL MILLER, FOX25 NEWS. &gt;&gt; OUR COVERAGE OF THE DEBATE
CONTINUES ON LINE AS WELL.
FROM OUR WEB SITE, A FULL TRANSSCRIPT OF THE DEBATE AND
THE TOP FIVE HIGHLIGHTS.
FOX25 WILL BE FOLLOWING THE ELECTION FOR THE NEXT 18 DAYS.

      <description>SCHOOL STUDENT FALLS OUT OF THE
BACK DOOR AND INTO TRAFFIC.
FOX25'S CATHERINE PARROTTA IN WAKEFIELD WITH THE
INVESTIGATION INTO WHAT WENT
WRONG. CATHERINE, GOOD MORNING.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: GOOD MORNING.
THAT STUDENT WAS ABLE TO REST AT HOME AND ALERT AFTER THIS
HAPPENED BUT DESPITE ALL THAT,
THE INVESTIGATION INTO HOW THAT HAPPENED CONTINUES.
&gt;&gt; IT WAS A LITTLE CONCERNING.
TEAMMATE TO FALL OFF THE BUS. &gt;&gt; Reporter: SOMEONE DID FALL
OFF THE SCHOOL BUS IT
WAKEFIELD. &gt;&gt; MY FRIEND WAS TEXTING ME ON
A GROUP CHAT AND SHE SAID SHE
WAS SITTING IN FRONT OF HIM AND SHE SAW HIM LEANING AND HE FELL
OUT THE BOOK DOOR.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: OFFICIALS SAY THE STUDENT WAS FROM THE GALVIN
MIDDLE SCHOOL AND IT HAPPENED
PULLING OUT OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
&gt;&gt; SAID THE CARS BEHIND HIM
LUCKILY STOPPED SO THEY DIDN'T RUN HIM OVER.
&gt;&gt; COULD HAVE BEEN A LOT WORSE.
IT COULD HAVE BEEN A LOT WORSE, I WAS NOT SURE HOW THIS
HAPPENED IN THE FIRST PLACE.
HOW COULD IT NOT HAPPEN ON THE SEAT.
THE STATE LAW FOR THE OPERATION
OF SCHOOL BUSES IS CLEAR, ACCORDING TO SECTION 7 B OF
CHAPTER 90, THE BUS OPERATOR
CAN'T ALLOW THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS TO EXCEED THE NUMBER
OF SEATS ON THE BUS AND THE
OPERATOR CAN'T DRIVE THE BUS. IF THE BUS HAS ADEQUATE STRAPS
AND HANDLES THREE PEOPLE MIGHT
BE ABLE TO STAND. UNCLEAR IF THE STUDENT WAS
SITTING OR STANDING.
WAKEFIELD SCHOOLS ARE INVESTIGATING AS THEY WAIT FOR
A RESPONSE FROM THE BUS
COMPANY. PARENT WAIT FOR ANSWERS.
&gt;&gt; CRAZY TO THINK GOING TO AND
FROM SCHOOL THAT YOUR KIDS CAN'T BE SAFE.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THE BUS HAS BEEN
TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE FOR TODAY AND I REACHED OUT TO THE
SUPERINTENDENT TO SEE IF WE CAN
GET AN UPDATE ON THE VEX.</description>

      <description>TOLLS.
BACK TO YOU.
&gt;&gt;&gt; THE FINAL DEBATE IN THE BOOKS AND FAR FROM DULL.
DONALD TRUMP REFUSED TO SAY
WHETHER OR NOT HE WILL ACCEPT THE RESULTS OF THE THE ELECTION
AND HILLARY CLINTON CALLED
TRUMP A PUPPET OF VLADIMIR PUTIN.
&gt;&gt; Sara:  MANY ARE PRAISING THE
MODERATOR CHRIS WALLACE FOR THEMING THEM ON TOPIC.
WHEN THINGS TURNED MORE
PERSONAL. &gt;&gt; Reporter: MUCH MORE FOCUS ON
THE ISSUE WHAT WE HAVE SEEN
WITH THE PREVIOUS DEBATES HERE FOR THE RACE FOR PRESIDENT.
FOR THE MOST PART, BOTH SIDES
REMAIN RELATIVELY CALM UNTIL THEY GOT INTO THE ISSUE OF
FITNESS TO BE PRESIDENT.
WALLACE ASKED ABOUT THE RECENT CONTROVERSY AROUND WIKILEAK AND
THE RECENT WOMEN WHO HAVE COME
FORWARD ACCUSING DONALD TRUMP OF UNWANTED SEXUAL ADVANCES.
THEY WENT BACK AND FORTH ON
THIS ISSUE SEVERAL TIMES. HERE IS WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY.
&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE, CHRIS, THAT SHE
GOT THESE PEOPLE TO STEP FORWARD.
IF IT WASN'T, THEY GET THEIR
TEN MINUTES OF FAME. BUT THEY WERE ALL TOTALLY -- IT
WAS ALL FICTION.
IT WAS LIES AND FICTION. &gt;&gt; HE SAID THAT HE COULD NOT
POSSIBLY HAVE DONE THOSE THINGS
TO THOSE WOMEN BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT ATTRACTIVE ENOUGH.
&gt;&gt; I DID NOT SAY THAT.
&gt;&gt; HE WENT ON THE TO SAY,  LOOK AT HER.
I DON'T THINK SO.
&gt;&gt; AS FOR WHO WON,  MANY THINK THAT TRUMP WAS IN MORE CONTROL
THIS DEBATE THAN WHAT WE HAVE
SEEN IN PREVIOUS DEBATES BUT WAS IT NOW MOVE THE NEEDLE IN
THE POLLS?
WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE. BOTH CANDIDATES HIT THE
CAMPAIGN TRAIL LATER TODAY.
IN LAS VEGAS, BLAIR MILLER, FOX25 NEWS.
&gt;&gt; Gene:  ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES
OF THE NIGHT WAS BORDER SECURITY.
BOTH CANDIDATES HAD PLENTY TO
SAY ABOUT THE TOPIC BUT ONE COMMENT BY DONALD TRUMP THAT IS
GOING VIRAL.
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE BAD HO MBRES HERE AND WE WILL GET THEM OUT.
&gt;&gt; SPARKED A NUMBER INTERNET
SEARCHES. SEARCHES FOR HOMBRES WITH AN H
JUMPED 120,000.
NOT EVERYBODY WAS CONCERNED OF THE SPELLING.
THE DICTIONARY SAID IT RECEIVED
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF HOMBRE WITHOUT AN H, THAT MEANS HAVING
COLORS THAT BLEND INTO EACH
OTHER LIKE A RAINBOW DEFINITION</description>

      <description>WE POSTED THE STORY ON
FOX25BOSTON.COM.
&gt;&gt;&gt; THREE MEN ARE IN JAIL FOLLOWING A VIOLENT HOME
INVASION.
THEY BROKE INTO A HOME IN EPPING NEW HAMPSHIRE LOOKING
FOR DRUGS.
HOW A NEIGHBORHOOD DOG ALERTED THEM OF THE SUSPECT.
&gt;&gt; Daniel:  THE HOMEOWNER'S DOG
SPOTTED THE MAN HIDING BY THEIR SHED.
THE BEAGLE NAMED LUCKY IS
CREDITED WITH SEEING THE FUGITIVE AFTER THE MAN WAS PART
OF A VIOLENT HOME INVASION IN
AN EPPING, NEW HAMPSHIRE NEIGHBORHOOD.
POLICE QUICKLY CAUGHT TWO OF
THE THREE MEN AFTER THEY PISTOL-WHIPPED THE VICTIM AND
CALLED POLICE FOR HELP.
THE THIRD SUSPECT MAY HAVE GOTTEN AWAY IF IT WEREN'T FOR
THE 9-YEAR-OLD BEAGLE WHO
SPOTTED THE MAN LURKING THE BACK YARD.
HELICOPTERS STARTED SEARCHING
THE AREA AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE AIR.
THAT IS ABOUT THE SAME TIME
LUCKY STARTED BARKING MORE FRANTICALLY THAN USUAL, AND HER
OWNERS LET HER OUT AND SHE WENT
STRAIGHT FOR THE SHED. &gt;&gt; I SAW HIM WHEN HE WENT BACK
INSIDE.
I SAW HIM CROUCHING -- A LITTLE STONE WALL AND I SAW HIM
CROUCHING AND TOTALLY CREEPED
ME OUT. &gt;&gt; Daniel:  NINA BARBOSA CALLED
911 AND DID NOT TRY TO
APPREHEND THE MAN. POLICE RESPONDED MEETLY AND
TOOK THEM IN.
THE THREE MEN HAVE BEEN CHARGED AND THE HOME INVASION WAS DRUG
RELATED AND THEY WANT TO SEE IF
THE MEN WERE INVOLVED IN OTHER CRIMES.

      <description>CONNECTOR.
BACK TO YOU.
&gt;&gt;&gt; WITH LESS THAN THREE WEEKS UNTIL THE PRESIDENTIAL
ELECTION, HILLARY CLINTON AND
DONALD TRUMP TOOK TO THE DEBATE STAGE ONE LAST TIME.
&gt;&gt; Sara:  LAST NIGHT'S DEBATE
IN LAS VEGAS STARTED OFF MORE FOCUSED ON THE ISSUE INSTEAD OF
PERSONAL ATTACKS AND TRUMP MADE
A STATEMENT THAT CHANGED THE NIGHT AND EVEN LEFT SOME OF HIS
SUPPORTERS SPEECHLESS.
FOX25'S DANIEL MILLER JOINS US WITH MORE.
&gt;&gt; Daniel:  GOOD MORNING.
DONALD TRUMP IS REFUSING TO SAY WHETHER OR NOT HE WILL ACCEPT
THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION IF
HE LOSES ON NOVEMBER 8. TAKE A LISTEN TO THE EXCHANGE
WITH MODERATOR CHRIS WALLACE.
&gt;&gt; I WILL LOOK AT IT AT THE TIME.
I AM NOT LOOKING AT ANYTHING
NOW. I WILL LOOK AT IT AT THE TIME WINNER AND THAT THE COUNTRY
COMES TOGETHER IN PART FOR THE
GOOD OF THE COUNTRY. ARE YOU SAYING YOU ARE NOT
PREPARED NOW --
&gt;&gt; WHAT I AM SAYING IS I WILL TELL YOU AT THE TIME.
I WILL KEEP NEW SUSPENSE.
&gt;&gt; Daniel:  WALLACE PUSHED TRUMP AND SAID ALWAYS A
PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER
AFTER AMERICAN ELECTIONS. AFTER THE DEBATE HILLARY
CLINTON CALLED IT A HORRIBLE
THING TO SAY. TRUMP REPEATED HIS CLAIMS THAT
THE ELECTION IS RIGGED.
SUPPORTERS INCLUDING HIS VERY OWN DAUGHTER AND MIKE PENCE HAS
SAID THAT TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN WILL
ACCEPT THE RESULTS. MEANWHILE, THE DEBATE TURNED
MORE PERSONAL WHEN THE TWO
CANDIDATES CLASHED OVER THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE'S
RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIAN
PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN. &gt;&gt; FROM EVERYTHING THAT I SEE
HAS NO RESPECT FOR THIS PERSON.
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE WOULD RATHER FROM A PUPPET AS PRESIDENT.
&gt;&gt; NO PUPPET.
NO PUPPET. YOU ARE THE PUPPET.
&gt;&gt; IT IS PRETTY CLEAR YOU WON'T
ADMIT THAT THE RUSSIANS HAVE ENGAGED IN CYBER ATTACKS
AGAINST THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA. THAT YOU ENCOURAGE ESPIONAGE
AGAINST OUR PEOPLE.
THAT YOU ARE WILLING -- &gt;&gt; Daniel:  ONE OF THE MOMENTS
-- IN ONE OF THE FINAL MOMENT
OF THE DEBATE. CLINTON WAS ANSWERING A
QUESTION ABOUT HOW SHE WOULD
RAISE TAXES ON THE RICH TO TACKLE THE DEBT.
SHE MADE A QUICK JAB AT TRUMP
FOR NOT PAYING FEDERAL TAXES AND HE BIT BACK.
&gt;&gt; MY SOCIAL SECURITY PAYROLL
CONTRIBUTION WILL GO UP AS WILL DONAL'S ASSUMING HE CAN'T
FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET OUT OF
IT, BUT WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS REPLENISH.
&gt;&gt; SUCH A NASTY WOMAN.
&gt;&gt; WELL, THROUGHOUT THE DEBATE, MODERATOR CHRIS WALLACE KEPT
THE CANDIDATES REINED IN AND
WASN'T STEAMROLLED BY ANY OF THEM.
THE POST DEBATE, 52% OF VIEWERS
SAY HILLARY CLINTON WON. 39% FAVORED DONALD TRUMP.
FOX25'S BLAIR MILLER WAS IN
VEGAS FOR THE DEBATE AND WE WILL HEAR FROM HIM COMING UP IN
30 MINUTES.

&gt;&gt;&gt; A 13-YEAR-OLD BOY IS NURSING A BULLET WOUND THIS
MORNING AFTER BEING HIT WHILE
SITTING INSIDE HIS APARTMENT. FOX25'S JESSICA REYES LIVE IN
CHELSEA THIS MORNING LIVE WITH
MORE ON WHERE THAT BULLET CAME FROM.
JESS, GOOD MORNING.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: GOOD MORNING, GENE.
ALL HAPPENED AT BELLINGHAM AND
SHAMUT STREET IN CHELSEA JUST AFTER 8:30.
WE SPOKE WITH THAT 13-YEAR-OLD
BOY'S BROTHER AND HE SAID A CAR PULLED OUT RIGHT OUTSIDE THIS
PARK.
SOMEONE GOT OUT OF THE CAR AND STARTED SHOOTING AND HE BELIEVE
ANOTHER PERSON WAS SHOOTING
FROM INSIDE THE CAR. SEVERAL SHOTS HE SAID WERE
FIRED.
ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT. ONE OF WHICH ENDED UP IN THE
SIDE OF THIS BUILDING.
IT WENT THROUGH THE WALL AND ENDED UP HITTING THAT
13-YEAR-OLD BOY IN THE
SHOULDER. &gt;&gt; I RAN TO MY HOUSE, AND THEN
I SEE MY BROTHER ON THE FLOOR
AND HE WAS SHOT, LIKE, IN THE BACK.
HE WAS SITTING DOWN IN HIS ROOM
ON THE BED AND THE BULLET WENT THROUGH THE WALL AND HIT HIM IN
THE BACK.
SO I GUESS HE GOT OFF THE BED AND STARTED RUNNING TO MY MOM'S
ROOM AND JUST SAT DOWN, BECAUSE
IT HURT HIM. SAT DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND HE
WAS YELLING "IT HURTS, IT
HURTS:". &gt;&gt; Reporter: HE WAS TAKEN TO
THE HOSPITAL, BUT WE ARE TOLD
HE IS EXPECTED TO BE OKAY. NO ONE HAS BEEN ARRESTED AT
THIS POINT, BUT POLICE DID SAY
THAT TWO PEOPLE WERE SEEN LEAVING THE AREA AND WHAT THEY
BELIEVE WAS A DARK COLORED SUV.
ANYONE WITH ANY INFORMATION AT ALL IS ASKED TO CONTACT CHELSEA
POLICE.

LIVE IN WAKEFIELD THIS MORNING WITH THE INVESTIGATION INTO
WHAT WENT WRONG.
CATHERINE, GOOD MORNING. &gt;&gt; Reporter: GOOD MORNING.
THAT STUDENT WAS RESTING AT
HOME LAST NIGHT. WE ARE TOLD THAT THE STUDENT
WAS ALERT AFTER THIS HAPPENED,
BUT THE INVESTIGATION INTO HOW IT HAPPENED CONTINUES TODAY.
ACCORDING TO SCHOOL OFFICIALS,
THIS HAPPENED ON A SCHOOL BUS AFTER SCHOOL ON THE DRIVE HOME.
AND THE STUDENT INVOLVED HERE
WAS A STUDENT FROM THE GALVIN MIDDLE SCHOOL AND FELL OUT OF
THE BACK DOOR OF THE MOVING BUS
AS IT WAS PULLING OUT OF THE BACK OF AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL A
MILE AND A HALF AWAY FROM THE
MIDDLE SCHOOL. A STUDENT DESCRIBES WHAT SHE
HEARD ABOUT THE INCIDENT.
&gt;&gt; MY FRIEND WAS TEXTING ME ON, LIKE, A GROUP CHAT AND SHE SAID
SHE WAS SITTING IN FRONT OF HIM
AND SAW HIM, LIKE, LEANING AND HE FELL OUT THE BACK DOOR.
SHE SAID THAT, LIKE, THE CARS
BEHIND THEM LUCKILY STOPPED SO THEY DIDN'T RUN HIM OVER.
&gt;&gt; STUDENTS ALSO DESCRIBE THAT
BUS AS BECOME PACKED. DESPITE ALL OF THAT NO ONE
KNOWS HOW THIS HAPPENED.
THE SUPERINTENDENT SAYS THEY ARE INVESTIGATING THIS IN
COOPERATION WITH THE BUS
COMPANY, AND THIS BUS THAT WAS INVOLVED HAS BEEN TAKEN OUT OF
SERVICE TODAY.
I HAVE ALSO REACHED OUT TO THE SUPERINTENDENT TO SEE IF WE CAN
GET AN UPDATE.
IN THE MEANTIME, I LOOKED INTO THE LAWS FOR OPERATING A SCHOOL
BUS, AND HE WILL HAVE THAT
INFORMATION COMING UP IN AN HOUR.
LIVE IN WAKEFIELD, CATHERINE
PARROTTA, FOX25 MORNING NEWS.</description>

YOU KNOW GRAB THE SUNGLASSES,

MOSTLY DRY TODAY.
SHOWERS WILL HOLD OFF UNTIL MUCH LATER IN THE DAY PROBABLY
DURING THE EVENING COMMUTE WE
START TO SEE THE FIRST OF THOSE SHOWERS AND OUR TIMELINE A
LITTLE INCONVENIENT FOR YOU
DRIVERS. MOST OF THE DAYLIGHT HOURS NICE
AND DRY.
HEAVIEST RAIN EXPECTED TOMORROW NIGHT.
56 IN BOSTON AS YOU WAKE UP.
45 IN PORTSMOUTH. 57 IN PLYMOUTH.
LET'S GO OUT TO WORCESTER
STARTING AT 53 DEGREES. WE HAVE GOT CLEAR SKIES RIGHT
NOW.
AND YOU CAN SEE TEMPERATURES NOT MOVING VERY MUCH THROUGH 7
A.M., IN FACT GOING DOWN A
COUPLE MORE DEGREES. WE HAVE CLEAR CONDITIONS.
THE LONGER WE ARE DARK OUT
THERE, THE COLDER IT IS GOING TO GET AND THAT SUN DOESN'T
COME UP UNTIL AFTER 7:00 THIS
MORNING. BY 9 A.M., 53 DEGREES.
11 A.M., 57 DEGREES.

IS POURING AT ALL TIMES FRIDAY,
ALTHOUGH WE HAVE GOT THE ALL-DAY RISK FOR RAIN AND WE
HAVE SCATTERED SHOWERS AROUND

REALLY HEAVY STUFF WILL BE
CLOSER TO THE FRONT WHICH ACTUALLY MOVES IN DURING THE

      <description>YOU APPROACH THE WESTON TOLLS.
&gt;&gt;&gt; THIS MORNING THE
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ARE HOPING THAT WHAT HAPPENED IN
VEGAS WON'T STAY IN VEGAS.
&gt;&gt; Daniel:  HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP TOOK THE DEBATE
STAGE ONE LAST IT TIME HOPING
TO SWAY UNDECIDED VOTERS TO THEIR CAUSE.
&gt;&gt; Julie:  ANDREW SPENCER SAY
THINGS STARTED WITH POLICY TALK AND QUICKLY GOT HEATED.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THE TWO CANDIDATES
STARTED FOCUSING ON THE QUESTIONS AND THE TWO TURNED TO
MORE PERSONAL ATTACKS.
&gt;&gt; HE GOES AROUND WITH CROCODILE TEARS OF HOW TERRIBLE
IT IS.
&gt;&gt; YOU TALK BUT DON'T GET ANYTHING DONE.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: AT TIMES HILLARY
CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP WANTED TO GET THE LAST WORD.
&gt;&gt; CHRIS WE DON'T GAIN
ANYTHING. IRAN IS TAKING OVER IRAQ.
IRAN IS TAKING OVER IRAQ.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: DEBATE MODERATOR CHRIS WALLACE TRIED TO GET THE
CANDIDATE TO STOP TALKING OVER
ONE ANOTHER. &gt;&gt; THIS IS AN OPEN DISCUSSION.
&gt;&gt; BUT THE SPECIFIC QUESTION
FOR PAY FOR PLAY -- &gt;&gt; BUT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE --
THERE IS A LOT OF EVIDENCE --
VERY GOOD WORK AND [OVERLAPPING SPEAKERS]
&gt;&gt; Reporter: WHEN WHEN HE YOU
CAN SEEDED. &gt;&gt; SUCH A NASTY WOMAN.
&gt;&gt; WHEN I WAS IN THE SITUATION
ROOM MONITORING THE RAID THAT BROUGHT OSAMA BIN LADEN TO
JUSTICE, HE WAS HOSTING THE
"CELEBRITY APPRENTICE." THERE WAS EVEN A TIME HE DIDN'T
GET AN EMMY FOR HIS TV PROGRAM
THREE TIMES IN A ROW AND HE STARTED TWEETING THAT THE EMMY
WAS RIGGED.
&gt;&gt; SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN IT. &gt;&gt; Reporter: HE DELIVERED THE
LINE THAT EVERYBODY IS TALKING
ABOUT. &gt;&gt; DO YOU MAKE THE SAME
COMMITMENT THAT YOU WILL
ACTUALLY -- SIR -- THAT YOU WILL SEPULVEDA THE RESULTS.
&gt;&gt; I WILL LOOK AT IT AT THE
TIME. I AM NOT LOOKING AT ANYTHING
NOW.
I WILL LOOK AT IT AT THE TIME. &gt;&gt; Reporter: I AM ANDREW
SPENCER REPORTING.
&gt;&gt; Julie:  LAST NIGHT RIGHT AFTER THE DEBATE, POLITICAL
HISTORIAN TOM WHALEN JOINED
VANESSA AND MARK TOO GIVE HIS TAKE ON THE DEBATE.
THE FIRST QUESTION, WHO WON?
&gt;&gt; I THINK CLINTON WON,  BUT I THINK TRUMP -- HE DID BETTER
THAN THE OTHER TWO TIMES HE WAS
DEBATING AND TONIGHT HIS GOAL WAS TO EXPAND HIS BASE, AND HE
DIDN'T ACCOMPLISH THAT, IN FACT
HE MIGHT ARE ALIENATED PARTICULARLY WOMEN VOTERS AND
LATINO TRYING TO BRING ON BOARD
HIS BANDWAGONS AND REFERRED TO LATINOS AS BAD HOMBRES WHICH IS
NOT GOING TO GO OVER WELL.
HE ALSO REFERRED TO HILLARY CLINTON AS SUCH A NASTY WOMAN.
AND THAT -- GIVEN THE BAD PRESS
HE HAS HAD OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS OVER HIS ALLEGED AFFAIRS
AND GROPING OF WOMEN, THAT IS
NOT GOING TO HELP HIM. &gt;&gt; Julie:  WE WILL HAVE
CONTINUING COVERAGE OF LAST
NIGHT'S DEBATE ALL MORNING INCLUDING THE MOMENTS THAT
TWITTER IS BUZZING ABOUT AND
THE REVIEWS FOR LAST NIGHT'S MODERATOR FOX NEWS CHRIS
WALLACE AND FOLLOWING THE
LATEST ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AS BOTH CANDIDATE HIT THE ROAD FOR
19 DAYS FOR THE GO GENERAL
ELECTION.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; ON THE MEND THIS WEEK.
&gt;&gt; 27-YEAR-OLD VETERAN RICHARD
CINTOLO IS RESTING AT HOME. MATT MORRIS AT MASS GENERAL IS
AND DOING WELL.
WE SPOKE WITH A FORMER POLICE DETECTIVE WHO KNOWS EXACTLY
WHAT THEY ARE GOING THROUGH.
&gt;&gt; Daniel:  THAT DETECTIVE WAS BROUGHT TO LIFE BY THE SAME
SURGERY TEAM THAT SAVED THOSE
TWO BOSTON OFFICERS. &gt;&gt; THAT TEAM HEAD BY DR. DAVID
KING.
THIS OFFICER WAS SHOT HALF A DOZEN TIME AT POINT-BLANK RANGE
AND DR. KING'S EXPERIENCE ON
THE BATTLE FIELD THAT HE USES ON THE OPERATING ROOM THAT
SAVES LIVES INCLUDING MARIO
ALVERAS. &gt;&gt; I WAS PROCESSING EVERYTHING
AND I WAS SAYING, GEEZ, YOU
CAN'T BELIEVE I MIGHT NOT GO HOME TODAY.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: STILL EMOTIONAL
GUNNED DOWN BY A MAN WANTED FOR SELLING GUNS TO GANGS.
NOVEMBER 2, 2010, DETECTIVE
OLIVERA APPROACHED THE MAN IN THE FRONT SEAT OF THE CAR.
MARIO TURNED HIS HEAD FOR A
SPLIT SECOND. &gt;&gt; I LOOKED DOWN AND I HEARD
FLASHES AND HEARD THE BANGS.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THE SUSPECT SHOT OLIVERA SIX TIMES.
&gt;&gt; I WAS STUNNED.
I REMEMBER FALLING BACK OF THE DOORJAMB TRYING TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: HE REMEMBERS THE ENTIRE THING VIVIDLY.
HIS PARTNER DRAGGING HIM TO
SAFE. THE SURGERY BEGAN.
HE FELL ASLEEP.
TWO DAYS LATER DR. DAVID KING WAS AT HIS BEDSIDE.
&gt;&gt; HE TOLD ME I WAS THE
LUCKIEST GUY HE EVER MET BEING SHOT THAT MANY TIMES.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: DR. KING, THE VERY
SAME TRAUMA SURGEON THAT FOX25 CONFIRMED LED THE TEAM THAT
SAVED THE BOSTON OFFICERS ONE
WEEK AGO. ALL OF THEM TELL FOX25 THAT IT
WAS DR. KING, NOT LUCK, THAT
SAVED HIM. &gt;&gt; MY HEART STOPPED TWICE.
I DIED ON THE TABLE TWICE, AND
THAT HE HAD CUT MY DIAPHRAGM AND REACHED IN WITH HIS OWN
HAND AND SQUEEZED MY HEART AND
PUMPED IT AND GOT IT BACK GOING AGAIN.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: OLIVERA REACHED
OUT TO FOX25 AS OUR STORY TOOK OFF ON SOCIAL MEDIA.
HE WANTS EVERYONE TO KNOW WHAT
AN INCREDIBLE DOCTOR DAVID KING IS.
&gt;&gt; HE HAS THAT GIFT TO SAVE
LIVES. &gt;&gt; Reporter: THE DAY OLIVERA
GOT SHOT, HE SAID I NEED TO SEE
MY FAMILY, ESPECIALLY MY SON, AND HE SAID THAT DR. KING GAVE
HIM THAT GIFT.
&gt;&gt; AT THIS TIME MY SON WAS THREE AND A HALF.
I JUST WANTED TO GET HOME TO MY
SON, MY LITTLE BOY. &gt;&gt; I AM JOHN M+ ONAHAN, FOX25
NEWS.
&gt;&gt; OLIVERA HELPED DR. KING WITH THAT TOURNIQUET PROGRAM
YESTERDAY.
THE SAME THING BPD CRED WITS HELPING TO SAVE THEIR OFFICERS'
LIVES YOU.
&gt;&gt; Daniel:  HE RUNS AN ASSOCIATION TO HELP OTHER
OFFICERS WHO HAVE BEEN
VIOLENTLY INJURED. HIS WAY OF PAYING IT FORWARD.
&gt;&gt; Julie:  IN THAT STORY THEY
SAY DR. KING CALLED OLIVERA LUCKY OF SURVIVING THE
GUNSHOTS.
BUT I WOULD SAY LUCKY FOR BEING MATCHED UP WITH DR. KING.
&gt;&gt; Daniel:  ABSOLUTELY.

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; 4:47 AND TAKE YOU OFF TO
OUR MAPS RIGHT NOW.
THINGS ARE LOOKING GOOD ON ROUTE 1.
A NEW ACCIDENT ON 93 SOUTH
APPROACHING THE ZAKIM. VOLUME IS SO LIGHT THAT IT
WON'T HAVE AN IMPACT ON YOUR
DRIVE TIMES. PIKE IS CLEAR FROM 495 TO 128
AND INTO THE ALLSTON-BRIGHTON
AREAS. OVER TO THOSE LIVE DRIVE TIMES.
WE WILL HAVE THOSE COMING UP
FOR YOU IN JUST A FEW MINUTES, BUT FIRST CHECK IN WITH
METEOROLOGIST SHIRI SPEAR.
AND THOSE WARMER DAYS ARE BEHIND US.
WE ARE MOVING BACK INTO FALL.
&gt;&gt; Daniel:  BACK TO NORMAL TEMPERATURES.
&gt;&gt; Shiri:  BACK TO NORMAL.
YOU GUYS ENJOY 80s. &gt;&gt; Daniel:  SO NICE I WENT UP
TO SALEM FOR THE DAY.
IT WAS GORGEOUS. &gt;&gt; Shiri:  NOW IF YOU GO UP TO
SALEM, YOU GET THE AMBIENCE AND
THE FALL-LIKE TEMPERATURES. HERE WE WERE YESTERDAY COMPARED
TO YESTERDAY.
YESTERDAY. BOSTON AT 81 TODAY.
MORE LIKE 61.
NOTHING LIKE A 20-DEGREE COOLDOWN.
TO THE 80s IN LAWRENCE AND
PLYMOUTH AND 60s ARE RULING. SO WE HAVE GOT HIGH PRESSURE IN
CONTROL RIGHT NOW AND THAT WILL
KEEP US PRETTY BRIGHT FOR THE MORNING HOURS.
BUT AS THIS SYSTEM KIND OF
EASES ITS WAY TOWARD US, CLOUDS CREEPING IN AND EVENTUALLY LATE
DAY RAIN.
TIMELINE WITH FUTURE CAST. 7 A.M. TEMPERATURES IN THE 40s
AND 50s.
I HAVE GOT 58  IN BOSTON DOWN TO 55 IN BEDFORD.
55 DEGREES IN PLYMOUTH THIS
MORNING SO KIND OF MILDEST ALONG THE COASTLINE.
AS WE GET TO NOONTIME TODAY,
TEMPERATURES IN THE LOW AND MID-60s.
A FEW OF THOSE CLOUDS I WAS
TALKING ABOUT. PARTLY SUNNY HERE, FOLKS.
AND DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS,
WE SLOWLY SEE THOSE CLOUDS INCREASE.
BY 5 P.M., MOST OF YOU LOOKING
DRY IF YOU ARE PART OF THE EARLY DRIVE HOME FROM WORK
HERE.
TEMPERATURES ARE GOING TO BE IN THE LOWER 60s.
IF YOU WERE DRIVING HOME A
LITTLE BIT AFTER THAT, WE ARE GOING TO START WATCHING FOR
SOME OF THE SHOWERS.
I SUSPECT THAT THEY START BETWEEN 5 AND 8:00 TONIGHT.
THEY ARE GOING TO BE FAIRLY
PATCHY, AND THEY DO CONTINUE STRAIGHT THROUGH THE OVERNIGHT
HOURS IN THAT SCATTERED
FASHION. THIS TIME TOMORROW, WE WILL BE
TRACKING THE RAIN SHOWERS.
THIS AFTERNOON I HAVE GOT HIGHS FROM 61 IN BOSTON TO 63 IN
LAWRENCE.
67 IN NORWOOD. 62 IN WORCESTER.
64 IN NASHUA, A NEW HAMPSHIRE
AND MID- TO UPPER 60s OVER THE CAPE AND ISLANDS.
LOW TEMPS IN THE 50s AND
POTENTIAL FOR SHOWERS AND AROUND TOWN TOMORROW, WE ARE
JUST PLANNING ON RAIN.
IT DOESN'T MEAN IT WILL BE POURING ALL DAY.
A LOT OF WHAT WE GET FOR THE
MORNING COMMUTE IS GOING TO BE FAIRLY -- FAIRLY LIGHT.
THERE COULD BE A COUPLE OF
BURSTS OF HEAVIER RAIN AND MOST OF IT FAIRLY LIGHT AND PRETTY
SCATTERED ON THE MAP.
PAUSES BETWEEN SHOWERS BOTH MORNING AND PROBABLY DURING
LUNCHTIME, BUT LUNCHTIME WE ARE
SEEING MORE OF THESE YELLOWS AND ORANGES POP ON TO THE MAP
AND MORE OF THESE LOCALLY HEAVY
SHOWERS AND WHAT WE ARE FACE AGENT 5 P.M. COULD BE LOCALLY
HEAVY RAIN BUT STILL KIND OF
SCATTERED. THE REAL STEADY, HEAVY STUFF
WILL LIKELY FORM HERE AND THIS
FRONT IS NEARING THE COASTLINE. ANOTHER SYSTEM THAT WILL BE
DRAWING UP SOME OF THE TROPICAL
MOISTURE AND SOME OF THE SHOWERS CONTINUE HERE INTO YOUR
SATURDAY.
THE WEEKEND IS NOT GOING TO BE, AGAIN, TERRIBLE.
OH, JUST LOOKING AT SOME OF
THESE UPDATED NUMBERS. I DON'T LIKE THIS.
I WILL BE FIDGETING WITH THIS.
THIS JUST UPDATED. MUST HAVE UPDATED A MOMENT AGO.
I AM EXPECTED FROM A HALF AN
INCH TO AN INCH OF RAIN DEPENDING ON WHERE WE GET THOSE
BURSTS OF HEAVIEST RAIN IN INTO
SATURDAY A CUP OF LINGERING SHOWERS.
A LOT OF LINGERING CLOUDS.
HIGH OF 59. WINDS TURN ACTIVE.
SUNDAY THE BRIGHTER AND DRIER
OF THE TWO DAYS AT 56 DEGREES AND A FEW MORE SHOWERS HERE
MOVING IN FOR MONDAY MORNING.
BACK OVER TO YOU, GUYS.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt; SHIRI, THANK YOU.
&gt;&gt;&gt; A MAN IN FLORIDA GOT QUITE
THE SURPRISE DRIVING HOME FROM WORK WHEN A SIX-FOOT SNAKE
STARTED SLITHERING ACROSS THE
FRONT OF HIS CAR. IT IS SAFE TO SAY THIS IS THE
LAST PLACE MOST DRIVERS WANT TO
SEE LOOKING BACK THROUGH THEM WITH THE WINDSHIELD.
INSTEAD OF PANICKING THE MAN
PULLED OVER AND TOOK THIS VIDEO MONDAY.
&gt;&gt; MY WINDOW WAS OPEN AND HE
WAS RESTING ON THE SIDE-VIEW MIRROR.
&gt;&gt; Daniel:  BEFORE THE SNAKE
HAD A CHANCE TO RIDE SHOTGUN HE ROLLED UP THE WINDOWS AND IT
SLITHERED AWAY.
EXPERTS THINK THE SNAKE WENT UNDER THE HOOD TO GET WARM.

WOULD HAVE THE GUTS TO SNAP THE</description>

&gt;&gt;&gt; TALK ABOUT A GRAND ENTRANCE INTO THE WORLD.
THIS STORY IS LIKELY ALL OVER
YOUR FACEBOOK FEED. A LOCAL MOM GIVES BIRTH TO A
BABY, AND SHE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
SHE WAS PREGNANT. &gt;&gt; Daniel:  A WILD TALE AND
THAT MOM TOLD EVERY BIT OF IT
TO KERRY KAVANAUGH. &gt;&gt; Reporter: 5 POUNDS, 4
OUNCES, ONE VERY BIG SUR
SURPRISE. &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING HAPPENED QUICK.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: ALINA MARTINEZ
WENT FROM NOT KNOWING SHE WAS PREGNANT TO NEW MOM IN SIX
HOURS.
&gt;&gt; IF I HEARD THIS STORY COMING FROM SOMEONE ELSE, I WOULD SAY
SHE IS LYING.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: MARTINEZ SAID THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS, HER LIFE WAS
NORMAL, SO WERE HER MENSTRUAL
CYCLES. SUNDAY MORNING SHE WOKE UP WITH
CRAMPS THAT KEPT GETTING WORSE.
&gt;&gt; MY SISTER IS A IN MEDICAL ASSISTANT.
COULD BE AN OVARIAN CYST.
I HAVE BEEN ON BIRTH CONTROL FOR YEARS AND YEARS.
IT GOT STRONGER AND MORE SPACED
OUT, MORE TIMED. I WAS LIKE, WAIT A MINUTE.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THAT'S WHEN SHE
WENT TO THE HOSPITAL AND AN TRAWL SOUND REVEALED INITIALLY
SHE WAS 15 WEEKS PREGNANT.
A SECOND ONE REVEALED ANOTHER SURPRISE.
&gt;&gt; LABOR AND DELIVERY.
YEAH, YOU ARE ACTUALLY AROUND 36 TO 38 WEEKS -- RIGHT WHEN
SHE FINISHED THE SENTENCE, MY
WATER JUST BROKE. &gt;&gt; Reporter: HE ARRIVED SHORTLY
AFTER THAT.
DAD MADE IT TO THE HOSPITAL BUT NEEDED TO SEE IT TO BELIEVE IT.
&gt;&gt; I AM GUESSING HE WAS TUCKED
UNDER A RIB. WAS GOING TO SURPRISE YOU.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THE SURPRISE OF A
LIFETIME FOR THIS NORTON WOMAN WHO CALLED HER LITTLE BUNDLE A
BIG BLESSING.
&gt;&gt; I ALWAYS HAVE BEEN AN AUNT. I WILL KEEP THE KIDS AND GIVE
THEM BACK TO THE MOTHER AND
FATHER, HERE, TAKE YOUR KID. I CAN'T GIVE HIM BACK NOW.
HE'S MINE AND I DON'T FEEL LIKE
HE IS MINE. IT IS SO SURREAL.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: JACKSON IS

      <description>TO HAPPEN.
&gt;&gt;&gt; AND GOOD MORNING,
EVERYBODY. THANKS FOR JOINING US ON THIS
THURSDAY MORNING.
IT IS OCTOBER 20. I AM GENE LAVANCHY.
&gt;&gt; Sara:  A AND I AM SARA
UNDERWOOD. WELL, IT WAS NICE WHILE IT
LASTED, BUT SUMMER IS GONE FROM
THE FORECAST. METEOROLOGIST SHIRI SPEAR SAYS
IT IS GOING TO BE COOLER AND
COULD EVEN TURN WETTER BY THE END OF THE DAY.
SHE IS IN THE FOX25 STORM
TRACKER WEATHER CENTER WITH THE VERY LATEST.
&gt;&gt; Shiri:  NOTHING LIKE WAKING
UP TO TEMPERATURES 10 TO 25 DEGREES COOLER THAN IT WAS
YESTERDAY WHEN YOU WOKE UP.
THAT MEANS WE ARE GETTING STARTED AT 56 DEGREES IN
BOSTON.
42 IN NORWOOD. 49 IN LAWRENCE.
53 IN WORCESTER.
LOTS OF 40s. LOTS OF 50s ON THE MAP.
THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE DRESSING
FOR THIS MORNING. A LITTLE FOG IN THE USUAL SPOTS
LIKE NORWOOD, KEENE OVER TO
ORANGE. KEEPING AN EYE ON THAT AND I
DON'T EXPECT IT TO TURN INTO A
VERY WIDESPREAD ITEM. AT 7 A.M., KEEPING TEMPERATURES
AS THEY ARE RIGHT NOW WITH
CLEAR SKIES. 9 A.M., 55 DEGREES.
WE WILL BE IN THE LOWER 50s BY
11:00 THIS MORNING. A DECENT WARM-UP ON THE WAY AND
AFTER THAT WE DON'T GO MUCH
HIGHER.</description>

SQUARING OFF IN A KEY
BATTLEGROUND STATE OF NEVADA. HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD
TRUMP WENT ONE ON ONE IN THEIR
FINAL PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE. &gt;&gt; Julie:  A FIERY NIGHT AND
BOTH SIDES CAME OUT SWINGING.
JOE WALDMAN REPORTS THIS MATCH-UP HIT ON POLICY TOPICS
BEGINNING WITH THE SUPREME
COURT. &gt;&gt; Reporter: HILLARY CLINTON
AND DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGNS
ARE IN FULL SPIN ROAD. EACH SIDE MAKING A CASE THAT
THEIR CANDIDATE WON IN WHAT WAS
A HIGH-STAKES DEBATE. &gt;&gt; WE NEED A SUPREME COURT THAT
WILL STAND UP ON BEHALF OF
WOMEN'S RIGHTS AND ON BEHALF OF THE RIGHTS OF THE LBG T
COMMUNITY.
&gt;&gt; WE NEED A SUPREME COURT THAT, FROM N MY OPINION, THAT
WILL UPHOLD THE SECOND
AMENDMENT. &gt;&gt; Reporter: AFTER AN ICY
GREETING, HILLARY CLINTON AND
DONALD TRUMP SQUARING OFF ONE FINAL TIME.
&gt;&gt; NO DOUBT THAT I RESPECT THE
SECOND AMENDMENT, THAT I ALSO BELIEVE THERE IS AN INDIVIDUAL
RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS.
THAT IS NOT IN CONFLICT WITH SENSIBLE, COMMON SENSE
REGULATION.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THIS THE LAST MAJOR PLATFORM FOR EACH TO MAKE
CLOSING ARGUMENTS.
&gt;&gt; SHE WANTS TO GIVE AMNESTY WHICH IS A DISASTER AND VERY
UNFAIR FOR ALL THE PEOPLE
WAITING IN LINE FOR YEARS AND YEARS.
WE NEED STRONG BORDERS.
SHE WANTS TO HAVE OPEN BORDERS. &gt;&gt; WHEN IT COMES TO THE WALL.
HE WENT TO THE MEXICO AND THE
MEXICAN PRESIDENT AND DIDN'T EVEN RAISE IT.
HE CHOKED.
&gt;&gt; SHE NATURALLY GETS NOTHING DONE AND THE WALL WASN'T BUILT,
BUT HILLARY CLINTON WANTED THE
WALL. &gt;&gt; I VOTED FOR BORDER SECURITY
--
&gt;&gt; A WALL. &gt;&gt; AND THERE ARE LIMITED PLACE
WHERE IS THAT WAS APPROPRIATE.
THERE ALSO IS NECESSARILY GOING TO BE NEW TECHNOLOGY AND HOW
BEST TO DEPLOY THAT.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: LESS THAN THREE WEEKS UNTIL THE ELECTION, THE
BIG QUESTION NOW WHAT IMPACT
DID THIS DEBATE JUST HAVE. ALL THIS AS PRESIDENT OBAMA IS
WORRIED THAT VIOLENCE COULD
BREAK OUT IF DONALD TRUMP LOSES OF ELECTION.
IN LAS VEGAS, PHIL WALTMAN.
&gt;&gt; THE DEBATES ARE CAN'T WATCH TV.
MORE PEOPLE WATCHED THE LAST
DEBATE THAN THE PATS LOSS IN THE NFC CHAMPIONSHIP.
&gt;&gt; Julie:  A WATCH PARTY WHERE
VIEWER REACTIONS WERE REWARDED WITH PRIZES.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: TONIGHT WE HUNG
OUT WITH A MOSTLY YOUNGER, PROFESSIONAL, URBAN CROWD AND
SAFE TO SAY THAT MOST HERE
FAVOR HILLARY CLINTON. THAT BEING SAID THOUGH, MANY
ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE WAY THE
ENTIRE ELECTION, THE ENTIRE RACE IS PLAYED OUT.
THEY SAY THERE HAS BEEN TOO
MUCH BICKERING AND NOT ENOUGH SUBSTANCE.
TAKE A LOOK AT THE LINE OF THE
PEOPLE READY TO GET IN. THEY REACHED CAPACITY WELL
BEFORE THE DEBATE STARTED AND
SOME PEOPLE HAD TO BE TURNED AWAY.
THE DEBATE WAS DISPLAYED ON
LARGE PROJECTION SCREENS AND THIS CROWD WAS HOOKED.
SOME OF THE REACTION.
THE FIRST WOMAN YOU ARE GOING TO HEAR FROM SAID SHE THINKS
TRUMP MADE GOOD POINTS, BUT SHE
WANTED HIM TO BE MORE ASSERTIVE AND CLEAR ON THE RECENT SEXUAL
ASSAULT ALLEGATIONS.
&gt;&gt; I WOULD LIKE HIM TO ADDRESS IT.
IF IT IS NOT WHO HE IS, INSTEAD
OF JUST SAYING, NO, I -- NO ONE RESPECTS WOMEN MORE THAN I DO.
NOT WHAT YOUR SO-CALLED LOCKER
ROOM TALK HAS SAID AND I WOULD LIKE IT BROUGHT UP AND TO BE
ABLE TO HEAR IT.
&gt;&gt; BOTH THE CANDIDATES TALKED OVER EACH OTHER.
NOT A GREAT DEBATE SET-UP.
SEEMS MORE LIKE A FISTFIGHT THAN A DEBATE.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: IN ADDITION TO
WATCHING THE DEBATE ON THE SCREENS, THE BAR HAD A TWITTER
FEED UP WHERE PEOPLE COULD
CHIME IN AND GIVE THEIR OPINIONS AS THE DEBATE WAS
ONGOING.
REPORTING IN SOMERVILLE, TED DANIEL, FOX25 NEWS.
&gt;&gt; Julie:  WHAT WOULD A DEBATE
BE WITHOUT TWITTER. REACTION POURING IN ABOUT THE
DEBATE ON THE SOCIAL MEDIA SITE
FROM LOCAL POLITICIANS. SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN SAID
HILLARY CLINTON PROVED SHE HAS
BRAINS, GUTS, THICK SKIN, STEADY HANDS AND MOST OF ALL
BASIC DEASON KNEE.
I AM WITH HER AND PROUD OF HER. FORMER SOX PITCHER A TRUMP
SUPPORTER WHO PLANS TO RUN FOR
WARREN'S SENATE SEAT SAID, WOW, SPENT 90 MINUTES AND LIED FOR
5400 CONSECUTIVE.
WALLACE WAS OUTSTANDING. SHOWCASING CHRIS WALLACE WHO
ANCHOR AND MODERATED THE
DEBATE. &gt;&gt; SCOTT BROWN SAID, WOW,
CONGRATS DONALD TRUMP.
BIG WIN. HE SPOKE PLAINLY TO REGULAR
HAVE FOLKS.
SHE STRUGTH. LET THE GAMES BEGIN, HURRAH.
SETH MOULTON WHAT A CONTRAST, A
AN OPTIMISTIC PLAN FOR OUR FUTURE VERSUS A CYNICAL
DIATRIBE.
AND EXPERTS WEIGHED IN GIVING THEIR TAKE ON ROUMD THREE.
BOSTON UNIVERSITY AND POLITICAL
HISTORIAN AND AUTHOR TOM WAYLAND GIVES US A TAKE ON WHO
WON AND THE BIGGEST MISTAKE OF

A BULLET HIT A TEENAGER IN
CHELSEA. THIS MORNING POLICE ARE LOOKING
FOR TWO MEN WHO SPED OFF FROM
THE SCENE OF THE CRIME. FOX25'S JIM MORELLI FIRST SPOKE
TO THE VICTIM'S BROTHER WHO
SAID THE BULLET CAME THROUGH THE WALL.
&gt;&gt; WE SPOKE TO A WITNESS
OUTSIDE WHEN THE SHOOTING BEGAN AND WHAT HE TELLS US A CAR
PULLED UP, A WHITE VEHICLE,
SOMEONE GOT OUT OF THE CAR AND STARTED SHOOTING
INDISCRIMINATELY OUTSIDE OF
THIS PARK. BELIEVES SOMEONE WAS IN THE CAR
SHOOTING FROM THE CAR AS WELL.
A WARM NIGHT. MANY PEOPLE IN THE PARK.
THEY ALL STARTED TO RUN.
HE STARTED TO RUN AND HE LIVES IN THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR WHICH IS
RIGHT UP HERE ON THE THIRD
FLOOR. AND HE TELLS US THAT HIS
BROTHER, HIS YOUNGER BROTHER
AGE 13 WAS ACTUALLY HIT BY A BULLET THAT PENETRATED THE WALL
NEAR ONE OF THE WINDOWS.
&gt;&gt; I RAN TO MY HOUSE, AND THEN I SEE MY BROTHER ON THE FLOOR
AND HE WAS SHOT IN THE BACK.
HE WAS SITTING DOWN IN HIS ROOM ON THE BED, AND THEN THE BULLET
WENT THROUGH THE WALL AND HIT
HIM IN THE BACK. SO EN I GUESS HE GOT OFF THE
BED AND STARTED RUNNING TO MY
MOM'S ROOM AND JUST SAT DOWN BECAUSE IT HURT HIM.
HE SAT DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND
JUST YELLING, IT HURTS, IT HURTS.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: I WAS DOWN THE
STREET A LITTLE EARLIER AND SOMEONE WALKED BY WHO WAS IN
THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND SHE WANTED
TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. I SAID THERE WAS A SHOOTING AND
EXPLAINED TO HER THAT A
13-YEAR-OLD CHILD WAS HIT WITH A STRAY BULLET AND SHE SAID I
WONDER IF THIS IS RELATED TO A
SHOOTING THAT HAPPENED TWO STREETS OVER HERE IN WHICH
SOMEONE, SHE SAYS, WAS ACTUALLY
KILLED. AND IN ANY CASE, THE LAST THING
SHE SAID TO ME I AM GOING
INSIDE BECAUSE THINGS AROUND HERE ARE GETTING SCARY.

      <description>THE CHARGES AGAINST THEM ARE
NOT CONSIDERED HATE CRIME.
&gt;&gt;&gt; A CONVICTED CHILD RAPIST WILL BE BEHIND BARS.
RICHARD GARDNER AND IN A RHODE
ISLAND COURT ROOM TO ANSWER TO CHARGES VIOLATED HIS PROBATION
IN MASSACHUSETTS.
WE REPORTED ON THE OUTRAGE AFTER HE WAS RELEASED MUCH
SOONER THAN EXPECTED.
THE PROSECUTOR TELLS A JUDGE THAT HE RECENTLY WENT TO A
QUINCY LIBRARY THAT VIOLATED
THE CONDITIONS OF HIS PROBATION.
&gt;&gt; AND IT WAS FREQUENTED BY
CHILDREN. &gt;&gt; IF MR. GARDNER ISN'T ALLOWED
AT THE PUBLIC LIBRARY, IF HE IS
THEN ALSO NOT ALLOWED AT THE BARNES &amp; NOBLE UP THE ROAD
BECAUSE THERE IS A CHILDREN'S
AREA. &gt;&gt; GARDNER WILL STAY LOCKED UP
UNTIL A PROBATION VIOLATION

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; 4:14.
THREE MEN ARE IN JAIL FOLLOWING
A VIOLENT HOME INVASION. WE WERE FOLLOWING THIS STORY
YESTERDAY.
THE SUSPECTS BROKE INTO A HOME IN EFFINGHAM LOOKING FOR DRUG.
THEY PISTOL-WHIPPED A MAN AND
TOOK OFF. TALKED ONE OF THE NEIGHBORS
THAT HELPED NAB THE SUSPECT.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: SHE WAS HOME WITH HER DOG LUCKY WHEN STATE AND
LOCAL POLICE DESCENDED ON THE
AREA ARMED WITH BIG GUNS SEARCHING WITH A HELICOPTER FOR
THE LAST THREE SUSPECTS IN A
HOME INVASION NEARBY. &gt;&gt; I GOT REALLY, REALLY
NERVOUS.
KNOCKED THE DOORS. I SAID I GOT TO STAY HERE.
THE HELICOPTER IS ABOVE OUR
HOUSE. &gt;&gt; Reporter: HE GOT THE SENSE
HE SHOULD COME HOME.
&gt;&gt; I WASN'T HOME FIVE MINUTES AND OUR DOG GOT SUPER CRAZY AT
THE SLIDER AND LET THE DOG OUT
AND THE DOG IMMEDIATELY AIMED FOR THE SHED AND WAS BARKING
AND REALLY UPSET.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THIS TIME MORE THAN A CRITTER HIDING THE SHED.
AN ARMED ROBBER POLICE HAVE
IDENTIFIED. &gt;&gt; WE CHECKED IT AND MY WIFE
WAS ON THE RIGHT SIDE.
I WAS ON THE LEFT SIDE AND HE TOOK OFF IN THE BACK OF THE
WOODS AND I IMMEDIATELY TOLD
HER GET THE DOG, GET IN THE HOUSE.
GET IN THE HOUSE.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: NATARANO HAD JUST BROKEN INTO A HOSPITAL WITH TWO
OTHERS TRYING TO GET DRUGS.
A MAN WAS HOME AT THE TIME AND WAS PISTOL-WHIPPED BEFORE THE
MEN TOOK OFF.
&gt;&gt; THEY HAD THE GUNS AND I STILL WOULDN'T COOPERATE AND
THEY GOT ME IN A CHOKEHOLD.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THE OTHER TWO SUSPECTS WERE ARRESTED QUICKLY
AND NATARANYO HID OUT IN THEIR
BACK YARD. &gt;&gt; I SAW HIM CROUCHING AND
TOTALLY CREEPED ME OUT.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THEY CALLED 911 AND HE WAS TAKEN IN.
QUITE A SHOCK FOR THE COUPLE.
&gt;&gt; I NEVER THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE END IN MY BACK YARD.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: BUT LOTS OF TREATS
FOR LUCKY.</description>

SHE YELLED FOR HIM TO GO AWAY AND THE MAN WAVED HER OFF.
HE JUMPED INTO A WINDOW WELL
AND TRIED GETTING INSIDE HER HOUSE AND THAT'S WHEN HER DOG
WENT CRAZY.

SEPARATE THE TWO. MESSAGES OF SUPPORT AND
ENCOURAGEMENT POURED IN FROM

LITTLE BOYS.

JADEN HAS HIS EYES OPEN. AND HE IS -- HE IS TRACKING,

MOVING -- HE WASN'T MOVING HIS LEFT SIDE THERE FOR A LITTLE
WHILE AND NOW HE IS MOVING HIS
LEFT ARM. &gt;&gt; JADEN -- I MEAN I THINK HE

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; IT IS 4:02 RIGHT NOW.
SQUARING OFF IN A KEY
BATTLEGROUND STATE OF NEVADA. HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD
TRUMP WENT ONE ON ONE IN THEIR
FINAL PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE. &gt;&gt; Julie:  A FIERY NIGHT AND
BOTH SIDES CAME OUT SWINGING.
JOE WALDMAN REPORTS THIS MATCH-UP HIT ON POLICY TOPICS
BEGINNING WITH THE SUPREME
COURT. &gt;&gt; Reporter: HILLARY CLINTON
AND DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGNS
ARE IN FULL SPIN ROAD. EACH SIDE MAKING A CASE THAT
THEIR CANDIDATE WON IN WHAT WAS
A HIGH-STAKES DEBATE. &gt;&gt; WE NEED A SUPREME COURT THAT
WILL STAND UP ON BEHALF OF
WOMEN'S RIGHTS AND ON BEHALF OF THE RIGHTS OF THE LBG T
COMMUNITY.
&gt;&gt; WE NEED A SUPREME COURT THAT, FROM N MY OPINION, THAT
WILL UPHOLD THE SECOND
AMENDMENT. &gt;&gt; Reporter: AFTER AN ICY
GREETING, HILLARY CLINTON AND
DONALD TRUMP SQUARING OFF ONE FINAL TIME.
&gt;&gt; NO DOUBT THAT I RESPECT THE
SECOND AMENDMENT, THAT I ALSO BELIEVE THERE IS AN INDIVIDUAL
RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS.
THAT IS NOT IN CONFLICT WITH SENSIBLE, COMMON SENSE
REGULATION.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THIS THE LAST MAJOR PLATFORM FOR EACH TO MAKE
CLOSING ARGUMENTS.
&gt;&gt; SHE WANTS TO GIVE AMNESTY WHICH IS A DISASTER AND VERY
UNFAIR FOR ALL THE PEOPLE
WAITING IN LINE FOR YEARS AND YEARS.
WE NEED STRONG BORDERS.
SHE WANTS TO HAVE OPEN BORDERS. &gt;&gt; WHEN IT COMES TO THE WALL.
HE WENT TO THE MEXICO AND THE
MEXICAN PRESIDENT AND DIDN'T EVEN RAISE IT.
HE CHOKED.
&gt;&gt; SHE NATURALLY GETS NOTHING DONE AND THE WALL WASN'T BUILT,
BUT HILLARY CLINTON WANTED THE
WALL. &gt;&gt; I VOTED FOR BORDER SECURITY
--
&gt;&gt; A WALL. &gt;&gt; AND THERE ARE LIMITED PLACE
WHERE IS THAT WAS APPROPRIATE.
THERE ALSO IS NECESSARILY GOING TO BE NEW TECHNOLOGY AND HOW
BEST TO DEPLOY THAT.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: LESS THAN THREE WEEKS UNTIL THE ELECTION, THE
BIG QUESTION NOW WHAT IMPACT
DID THIS DEBATE JUST HAVE. ALL THIS AS PRESIDENT OBAMA IS
WORRIED THAT VIOLENCE COULD
BREAK OUT IF DONALD TRUMP LOSES OF ELECTION.
IN LAS VEGAS, PHIL WALTMAN.
&gt;&gt; THE DEBATES ARE CAN'T WATCH TV.
MORE PEOPLE WATCHED THE LAST
DEBATE THAN THE PATS LOSS IN THE NFC CHAMPIONSHIP.
&gt;&gt; Julie:  A WATCH PARTY WHERE
VIEWER REACTIONS WERE REWARDED WITH PRIZES.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: TONIGHT WE HUNG
OUT WITH A MOSTLY YOUNGER, PROFESSIONAL, URBAN CROWD AND
SAFE TO SAY THAT MOST HERE
FAVOR HILLARY CLINTON. THAT BEING SAID THOUGH, MANY
ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE WAY THE
ENTIRE ELECTION, THE ENTIRE RACE IS PLAYED OUT.
THEY SAY THERE HAS BEEN TOO
MUCH BICKERING AND NOT ENOUGH SUBSTANCE.
TAKE A LOOK AT THE LINE OF THE
PEOPLE READY TO GET IN. THEY REACHED CAPACITY WELL
BEFORE THE DEBATE STARTED AND
SOME PEOPLE HAD TO BE TURNED AWAY.
THE DEBATE WAS DISPLAYED ON
LARGE PROJECTION SCREENS AND THIS CROWD WAS HOOKED.
SOME OF THE REACTION.
THE FIRST WOMAN YOU ARE GOING TO HEAR FROM SAID SHE THINKS
TRUMP MADE GOOD POINTS, BUT SHE
WANTED HIM TO BE MORE ASSERTIVE AND CLEAR ON THE RECENT SEXUAL
ASSAULT ALLEGATIONS.
&gt;&gt; I WOULD LIKE HIM TO ADDRESS IT.
IF IT IS NOT WHO HE IS, INSTEAD
OF JUST SAYING, NO, I -- NO ONE RESPECTS WOMEN MORE THAN I DO.
NOT WHAT YOUR SO-CALLED LOCKER
ROOM TALK HAS SAID AND I WOULD LIKE IT BROUGHT UP AND TO BE
ABLE TO HEAR IT.
&gt;&gt; BOTH THE CANDIDATES TALKED OVER EACH OTHER.
NOT A GREAT DEBATE SET-UP.
SEEMS MORE LIKE A FISTFIGHT THAN A DEBATE.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: IN ADDITION TO
WATCHING THE DEBATE ON THE SCREENS, THE BAR HAD A TWITTER
FEED UP WHERE PEOPLE COULD
CHIME IN AND GIVE THEIR OPINIONS AS THE DEBATE WAS
ONGOING.
REPORTING IN SOMERVILLE, TED DANIEL, FOX25 NEWS.
&gt;&gt; Julie:  WHAT WOULD A DEBATE
BE WITHOUT TWITTER. REACTION POURING IN ABOUT THE
DEBATE ON THE SOCIAL MEDIA SITE
FROM LOCAL POLITICIANS. SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN SAID
HILLARY CLINTON PROVED SHE HAS
BRAINS, GUTS, THICK SKIN, STEADY HANDS AND MOST OF ALL
BASIC DEASON KNEE.
I AM WITH HER AND PROUD OF HER. FORMER SOX PITCHER A TRUMP
SUPPORTER WHO PLANS TO RUN FOR
WARREN'S SENATE SEAT SAID, WOW, SPENT 90 MINUTES AND LIED FOR
5400 CONSECUTIVE.
WALLACE WAS OUTSTANDING. SHOWCASING CHRIS WALLACE WHO
ANCHOR AND MODERATED THE
DEBATE. &gt;&gt; SCOTT BROWN SAID, WOW,
CONGRATS DONALD TRUMP.
BIG WIN. HE SPOKE PLAINLY TO REGULAR
HAVE FOLKS.
SHE STRUGTH. LET THE GAMES BEGIN, HURRAH.
SETH MOULTON WHAT A CONTRAST, A
AN OPTIMISTIC PLAN FOR OUR FUTURE VERSUS A CYNICAL
DIATRIBE.
AND EXPERTS WEIGHED IN GIVING THEIR TAKE ON ROUMD THREE.
BOSTON UNIVERSITY AND POLITICAL
HISTORIAN AND AUTHOR TOM WAYLAND GIVES US A TAKE ON WHO
WON AND THE BIGGEST MISTAKE OF

THE SCENE OF THE CRIME. FOX25'S JIM MORELLI FIRST SPOKE
TO THE VICTIM'S BROTHER WHO
SAID THE BULLET CAME THROUGH THE WALL.
&gt;&gt; WE SPOKE TO A WITNESS
OUTSIDE WHEN THE SHOOTING BEGAN AND WHAT HE TELLS US A CAR
PULLED UP, A WHITE VEHICLE,
SOMEONE GOT OUT OF THE CAR AND STARTED SHOOTING
INDISCRIMINATELY OUTSIDE OF
THIS PARK. BELIEVES SOMEONE WAS IN THE CAR
SHOOTING FROM THE CAR AS WELL.
A WARM NIGHT. MANY PEOPLE IN THE PARK.
THEY ALL STARTED TO RUN.
HE STARTED TO RUN AND HE LIVES IN THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR WHICH IS
RIGHT UP HERE ON THE THIRD
FLOOR. AND HE TELLS US THAT HIS
BROTHER, HIS YOUNGER BROTHER
AGE 13 WAS ACTUALLY HIT BY A BULLET THAT PENETRATED THE WALL
NEAR ONE OF THE WINDOWS.
&gt;&gt; I RAN TO MY HOUSE, AND THEN I SEE MY BROTHER ON THE FLOOR
AND HE WAS SHOT IN THE BACK.
HE WAS SITTING DOWN IN HIS ROOM ON THE BED, AND THEN THE BULLET
WENT THROUGH THE WALL AND HIT
HIM IN THE BACK. SO EN I GUESS HE GOT OFF THE
BED AND STARTED RUNNING TO MY
MOM'S ROOM AND JUST SAT DOWN BECAUSE IT HURT HIM.
HE SAT DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND
JUST YELLING, IT HURTS, IT HURTS.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: I WAS DOWN THE
STREET A LITTLE EARLIER AND SOMEONE WALKED BY WHO WAS IN
THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND SHE WANTED
TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. I SAID THERE WAS A SHOOTING AND
EXPLAINED TO HER THAT A
13-YEAR-OLD CHILD WAS HIT WITH A STRAY BULLET AND SHE SAID I
WONDER IF THIS IS RELATED TO A
SHOOTING THAT HAPPENED TWO STREETS OVER HERE IN WHICH
SOMEONE, SHE SAYS, WAS ACTUALLY
KILLED. AND IN ANY CASE, THE LAST THING
SHE SAID TO ME I AM GOING
INSIDE BECAUSE THINGS AROUND HERE ARE GETTING SCARY.
IN CHELSEA, JIM MORELLI, FOX25

THREE MEN ARE IN JAIL FOLLOWING
A VIOLENT HOME INVASION. WE WERE FOLLOWING THIS STORY
YESTERDAY.
THE SUSPECTS BROKE INTO A HOME IN EFFINGHAM LOOKING FOR DRUG.
THEY PISTOL-WHIPPED A MAN AND
TOOK OFF. TALKED ONE OF THE NEIGHBORS
THAT HELPED NAB THE SUSPECT.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: SHE WAS HOME WITH HER DOG LUCKY WHEN STATE AND
LOCAL POLICE DESCENDED ON THE
AREA ARMED WITH BIG GUNS SEARCHING WITH A HELICOPTER FOR
THE LAST THREE SUSPECTS IN A
HOME INVASION NEARBY. &gt;&gt; I GOT REALLY, REALLY
NERVOUS.
KNOCKED THE DOORS. I SAID I GOT TO STAY HERE.
THE HELICOPTER IS ABOVE OUR
HOUSE. &gt;&gt; Reporter: HE GOT THE SENSE
HE SHOULD COME HOME.
&gt;&gt; I WASN'T HOME FIVE MINUTES AND OUR DOG GOT SUPER CRAZY AT
THE SLIDER AND LET THE DOG OUT
AND THE DOG IMMEDIATELY AIMED FOR THE SHED AND WAS BARKING
AND REALLY UPSET.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THIS TIME MORE THAN A CRITTER HIDING THE SHED.
AN ARMED ROBBER POLICE HAVE
IDENTIFIED. &gt;&gt; WE CHECKED IT AND MY WIFE
WAS ON THE RIGHT SIDE.
I WAS ON THE LEFT SIDE AND HE TOOK OFF IN THE BACK OF THE
WOODS AND I IMMEDIATELY TOLD
HER GET THE DOG, GET IN THE HOUSE.
GET IN THE HOUSE.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: NATARANO HAD JUST BROKEN INTO A HOSPITAL WITH TWO
OTHERS TRYING TO GET DRUGS.
A MAN WAS HOME AT THE TIME AND WAS PISTOL-WHIPPED BEFORE THE
MEN TOOK OFF.
&gt;&gt; THEY HAD THE GUNS AND I STILL WOULDN'T COOPERATE AND
THEY GOT ME IN A CHOKEHOLD.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THE OTHER TWO SUSPECTS WERE ARRESTED QUICKLY
AND NATARANYO HID OUT IN THEIR
BACK YARD. &gt;&gt; I SAW HIM CROUCHING AND
TOTALLY CREEPED ME OUT.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THEY CALLED 911 AND HE WAS TAKEN IN.
QUITE A SHOCK FOR THE COUPLE.
&gt;&gt; I NEVER THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE END IN MY BACK YARD.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: BUT LOTS OF TREATS
FOR LUCKY.</description>

      <description>HOUR AND          15 MINUTES.
&gt;&gt; Sara: MAN RECENTLY RELEASED
FROM JAIL THAT EXPOSED HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; Catherine: HE WILL BE HERE
AT THE COURTHOUSE TO MAKE
APPEARANCE AND POLICE ALSO SAID IT IS DUE IN PART TO THE QUICK
THINKING BY ONE OF THE TEENAGERS
ON THE BUS THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO CATCH UP WITH HIM SO QUICKLY.
POLICE DO SAY THAT ALL OF THIS
HAPPENED LATE AFTERNOON AND HAPPENED NEAR AGRICULTURAL HIGH
SCHOOL.
DARREN GRANT HEADED GIRLS TO VOLLEYBALL GAME AND SOME POINT
HE PULLED ALONG SIDE THE BUS AND
EXPOSED HIMSELF AND COMMITTED A LEWD ACT.
ONE OF THE TEENS TOOK A PICTURE
OF GRANT'S CAR AND TOLD A CHAPERONE.
&gt;&gt; THEY WERE RESPONDING TO THE
SCENE AND KNEW THAT WAS THE AREA OF LEVEL THREE SEX OFFENDER.
&gt;&gt; Catherine: GRANT WAS
WEARING A GPS MONITORING BRACELET AND ALLOWED HIM TO
TRACK DOWN IN WEYMOUTH AND RIGHT
NOW HELD ON $50,000 CASH BAIL. AGAIN, HE IS EXPECTED TO BE HERE
AT THE COURTHOUSE IN WRENTHAM A
LITTLE BIT LATER ON TODAY, BUT WE ALSO LEARNED A LITTLE BIT
MORE ABOUT SOME OF HIS PAST,
WHAT HE WAS CONVICTED OF IN THE PAST AND SURPRISING BIT OF
INFORMATION ABOUT THE CURRENT
ADDRESS AND HAVE ALL OF THAT COMING UP IN ABOUT AN HOUR.
LIVE IN WRENTHAM, CATHERINE
PARROTTA, FOX25 NEWS. &gt;&gt; Sara: THIS MORNING ANDOVER
POLICE TRACKING DOWN MAN THEY
SAY EXPOSED HIMSELF NEAR A SCHOOL.
THE STUDENTS AT ST. AUGUSTINE
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WERE AT RECESS WHEN SAW HIM ON MONDAY.
THEY TOLD THE PARENTS WHO THEN
LET THE PRINCIPAL KNOW ABOUT THE INCIDENT AND SHE CALLED POLICE.
&gt;&gt; EXPOSED HIMSELF AND AT WHICH
POINT COVERED BACK UP, PICKED UP CELL PHONE AND PRETEND HE WAS
SPEAKING ON IT AND THEN EXPOSED
HIMSELF AND AT LEAST A SECOND TIME.
&gt;&gt; Sara: POLICE DESCRIBE HIM
AS WHITE MAN SLENDER BUILD AND SILVER OR BLACK HONDA OR
VOLKSWAGEN.
&gt;&gt; Gene: 14-YEAR-OLD HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT RIDING BIKE IN
BROCKTON LAST NIGHT HIT.
STEPHANIE, YOU JUST TALKED TO THE CITY'S MAYOR ABOUT THE
DEVASTATING CRASH.
&gt;&gt; Stephanie: HOPING GIVES ANSWERS TO WHAT HAPPENED AND WE
ARE HERE AT THE CRASH SITE AND
MAIN STREET IN BROCKTON AND LAST 30 MINUTES OR SO WE HAVE
ACTUALLY SEEN PEOPLE STUFFED
ANIMALS NEAR WHERE THIS ALL HAPPENED.
AGAIN, THE VICTIM HAS NOW BEEN
IDENTIFIED AS MEDILO AND DENTED FROM THE IMPACT AND SAW THE
VICTIM'S BIKE ALONG THE SIDE OF
THE ROAD AND HAPPENED AROUND 6:30 LAST NIGHT.
FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED
AND SAW THEM TESTING THE BRAKES ON SUV TO CHECK FOR MECHANICAL
FAILURE.
BY WHILE ALL OF THIS WAS HAPPENING, DESPERATELY TRYING TO
IDENTIFY THE TEEN AND NOTIFY THE
FAMILY, HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY ID ON HIM AND HIS CELL PHONE WAS LOST,
SO THEY WERE UNABLE TO ACCESS
THE CONTENT AND UNFORTUNATELY IT TOOK FOUR HOURS BEFORE THEY WERE
FINALLY ABLE TO NOTIFY HIM.
THIS MORNING WE HAVE UNDERSTOOD AND WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT GRIEF
COUNSELORS WILL BE AT THE HIGH
SCHOOL ALONG WITH MIDDLE SCHOOL WHERE HE HAS SIBLINGS AND MAYOR
CARPENTER SAYS AS YOU CAN
IMAGINE CREDIBLY DIFFICULT FOR EVERYONE.
&gt;&gt; EVERYTHING I HEARD ABOUT THE
YOUNG MAN THIS MORNING WAS THAT HE WAS A WONDERFUL YOUNG MAN,
EXCELLENT STUDENT, MODEL CITIZEN
AND REALLY A TREMENDOUS LOSS TO US.
&gt;&gt; Stephanie: AT THIS POINT IN
TIME THEY ARE NOT RELEASING THE DRIVER'S NAME.

      <description>&gt;&gt; Daniel: DR. KING
REINTRODUCED TOURNIQUET THROUGH
THE PROGRAM AND INCLUDED BOSTON POLICE WHO TOOK THE PROGRAM A
WEEK BEFORE THE EAST BOSTON
SHOOTING. POLICE OFFICERS CREDITED THE
TRAINING AND MGH AND DR. KING'S
NAME WAS SECRET UNTIL BILL EVANS THANKED MGH EFFORTS IN HELPING
SAVE THE LIVES OF OFFICERS.
THE COMMISSIONER MENTIONED DR. KING'S NAME WHICH WAS
FAMILIAR TO US AND SAVED LIVES
IN MARATHON BOMBINGS IN 2013. &gt;&gt; TALK ABOUT A COINCIDENCE
PAYING OFF.
&gt;&gt; Daniel: DR. KING'S TWITTER PAGE LIST THINGS AS MARATHON
TRIATHLETE, SURGEON, PROFESSOR
AND DEPLOYED TO IRAQ AND LIEUTENANT COLONEL COMBAT
SURGEON BEFORE HE STARTED
WORKING AT MASS GENERAL IN 2008. SOME OF THE TRAINING HELPED
TREAT MARATHON VICTIMS AFTER THE
BOMBING. DANIEL MILLER, FOX25 NEWS.
&gt;&gt; Sara: TRUE HERO.
WE WOULD RATHER SEE BIG PAPI IN THE PLAYOFFS RIGHT NOW BUT LOOK
AT FIRST FEW DAYS IN RETIREMENT
MIGHT MAKE YOU SMILE. LOOK AT THIS SELFIE THAT DAVID
ORTIZ POSTED ON FACEBOOK ACCOUNT
AND WROTE FINALLY CHILLING AT HOME AND HE LOOKS PRETTY HAPPY
AND RELAXED.
WOULDN'T YOU SAY, JULIE? &gt;&gt; Julie: HE BROUGHT SO MUCH
JOY TO THE CITY AND SO MANY
PEOPLE. NOT BRING US RIGHT NOW THE
TRAFFIC, JAMPACKED AND SLOWER
DRIVE TIMES THAN ISSUE BECAUSE OF EARLIER ACCIDENT IN O'NEILL
TUNNEL AND ANOTHER ONE AT
SOUTHAMPTON STREET. ACCIDENT LINGERING AND BACKING
THING UP ALL THE WAY TO THE
BRAINTREE SPLIT. NORTH OF THE PIKE 128 SOUTHBOUND
AND NOT MUCH OF SURPRISE.
WE ARE USED TO SEEING HEAVY STEADY VOLUME THROUGH THE
LEXINGTON AREA.
EXPRESSWAY AND HOUR AND TEN MINUTES TO BRAINTREE SPLIT TO
THE EXIT FOR THE PIKE.
THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE ON RADAR IF RUNNING ERRANDS,
HEAD TO WORK AND TAKE CARE OF
ANY CHORES. 50 MINUTES RIGHT NOW ON 93 SOUTH
495 TO THE LEVERETT CONNECTOR.
AND NOT TYPICAL FOR 93 SOUTH. GET PATIENT AND GET THROUGH IT
THIS MORNING.
&gt;&gt; Gene: DEAL WITH WARM WEATHER AND I PEAKED AT HER
SEVEN DAY DOWN THE ROAD.
NOT STICKING AROUND. AM I ALLOWED TO DISCLOSE THAT?
&gt;&gt; Shiri: IT IS FALL.
81 RECORD HIGH IN PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND.
AND BOSTON, WORCESTER, OR IN
CONCORD TODAY DESPITE THE FACT WE WILL HAVE 80s SPRINKLE OUT
THERE.
COLD FRONT PULLING THROUGH AND DRYER AYER, IN THE COLDER AIR
AND NOTICE HUMIDITY DROP THIS
AFTERNOON. STIRRING UP CLOUD COVER AND
10:00 THIS MORNING GOT A LOT OF
MIDDLE 70s ON MAP, PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES, VERY SLIGHT CHANCE
OF SHOWER TODAY AND BASED ON
WHAT I'M SEEING ON RADAR AND WAY THE FRONT IS SHAPING UP, LIKELY
JUST GOING TO AMOUNT TO CLOUDS
FOR MOST OF YOU. SO BY NOON TIME WE ARE ALREADY
UP NORTH AND WEST AND BOSTON AND
TEMPERATURES NORWOOD UPPER 70 FOR THE AFTERNOON, YOU COULD SEE
NORWOOD, PROVIDENCE,
RHODE ISLAND, BOTH IN THE 80s. GOT A LOT OF 70s ELSEWHERE AND
KEEPS GETTING BRIGHTER FROM
NORTH TO SOUTH HERE AS WE GO. SO ONE SPOT PROBABLY CLINGING TO
THE CLOUDS THE LONGEST ENDS UP
BEING SOUTHEASTERN MASSACHUSETTS.
I'M GOING TO KEEP YOU GUYS
PARTLY CLOUDY PLYMOUTH AT 80Â°, HYANNIS AT 75 AND 81 NORWOOD,
LOWER 80s INTO FRAMINGHAM AND
UPPER 70s IN LAWRENCE AND OVER TO THE NORTH SHORE, UP INTO
SOUTHERN NEW HAMPSHIRE AS WELL.
BOSTON HOW DOES 78 SOUND? 78 SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.
NORMAL HIGH 60.
SO THIS IS ALMOST 20Â° ABOVE AVERAGE.
LOW TEMPS TONIGHT WILL BE BACK
INTO THE 40s AND 50s. THAT'S WHAT YOU WILL WAKE UP TO
TOMORROW MORNING CONSIDERING WE
STARTED IN THE 60s THIS MORNING.
IT IS GOING TO FEEL QUITE A BIT
COOLER. HIGHS ONLY IN THE 60s
TOMORROW.
THIS IS WHERE TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE THIS TIME OF THE YEAR.
WE WILL GET STARTED WITH SOME
SUNSHINE HERE WITH FUTURE CAST BUT AS DAY GOES ON YOU COULD SEE
THE CLOUDS MOVING IN AND THIS IS
5:00 P.M. WE START SEEING SOME SHOWERS
DEVELOP.
THAT COULD IMPACT THE EVENING COMMUTE TOMORROW AND THEN
OVERNIGHT HEAR THE RAIN FALLING
WHEN YOU GO TO SLEEP TOMORROW NIGHT.
WHEN YOU WAKE UP FRIDAY MORNING
I GOT GOOD AND BAD NEWS. FRIDAY WE ARE PLANNING ON CHANCE
FOR RAIN ALL DAY, BUT THE DRYEST
TIME OF THE DAY WILL TEND TO BE THE MORNING.
I'M SEEING SOME VERY PATCHY RAIN
AT BEST. REALLY HEAVY STUFF IS PROBABLY
GOING TO HOLD OFF UNTIL EITHER
AFTERNOON OR FRIDAY NIGHT. WE GOT TWO PLAYERS HERE, WE GOT
THE FRONT, ALSO GOT ANOTHER AREA
OF LOW PRESSURE COMING UP FROM THE SOUTH, DRAGGING SOME
TROPICAL MOISTURE INTO PLACE.
THAT COULD REALLY HELP FUEL PRETTY HEAVY STUFF HERE DURING
THE SECOND HALF OF FRIDAY.
TEMPERATURE WILL BE ABOUT 70Â°. OVER THE WEEKEND COOLING TO 60
ON SATURDAY AS WE DRY OUT.
ON SUNDAY 56 AND BREEZY AND HIGHS ONLY IN THE 50s AS WE
GET INTO NEXT WEEK.
OVER TO YOU. &gt;&gt; Sara: SHIRI HAS BEEN
TELLING US IT MIGHT HIT 80 AND
ONE LOCAL TOWN IT IS BEGINNING TO LOOK ATE LIKE CHRISTMAS.
LYNN FELLS PARKWAY IN SAUGUS
ALREADY DECORATED FOR THE HOLIDAYS.
FAMILY TELLS US THEY LIKE TO GET
EVERYTHING OUT THERE NOW BEFORE IT GETS TOO COLD.
&gt;&gt; GET OUT OF THE WAY AND RELAX.
&gt;&gt; FAMILY TURNED LIGHTS ON FOR US BUT THEY SAY TYPICALLY THEY
DON'T POWER THEM OFF UNTIL LATER
IN THE SEASON. THAT NEIGHBORHOOD AND LOTS OF
LIGHTS DURING THE HOLIDAYS.
&gt;&gt; Gene: STRESSING PERFORMANCE OF HEALTHY DIET DURING
PREGNANCY.

TURNS LESS MUGGY FOR THE
AFTERNOON AND COMING UP LESS THAN TEN MINUTES GOT LOOK AT
COMMUTE FORECAST AND WHAT KIND
OF TEMPERATURES YOU WILL BE DRIVING HOME TO.
LOOK AT EXPRESSWAY.
&gt;&gt; Julie: EXPRESSWAY A LITTLE BIT HARD TO MAKE OUT, ACCIDENT
IN THE SOUTHBOUND LANE, THAT WAS
BACKED UP AND NORTHBOUND LANES IN O'NEILL TUNNEL AND ACCIDENT
IN THE TUNNEL WHICH IS WHY THIS
IS JAMPACKED RIGHT NOW AND CONTINUING TO SLOWER DRIVE TIMES
ON THE EXPRESSWAY THAN USUAL.
THINGS A LITTLE BIT SPOTTY AS WELL ON 128 APPROACHING THE
BRAINTREE SPLIT.
NORTH OF THE PIKE ROUTE 1 JAMPACKED AS 93 SOUTH AND 128
SOUTHBOUND 93.
LIVE DRIVE TIMES, 43 MINUTES ON ROUTE 1 AND ON THE EXPRESSWAY
FROM THE BRAINTREE SPLIT TO THE
EXIT FOR THE PIKE AND 52 MINUTES 93 SOUTH AS YOU APPROACH THE
LEVERETT CONNECTOR.
BACK TO YOU. &gt;&gt; Sara: POLICE SPEND OUR
RECREATING A DEADLY ACCIDENT
THAT TOOK THE LIFE OF 14-YEAR-OLD BOY.
&gt;&gt; HE WAS RIDING BIKE LAST NIGHT
WHEN HIT AND KILLED BY SUV. FOX25 STEPHANIE COUEIGNOUX LIVE
AT THE SCENE.
STEPHANIE, TOOK POLICE ABOUT FOUR HOURS TO IDENTIFY HIM
BECAUSE THE CELL PHONE HE HAD AT
THE SCENE WAS LOCKED. &gt;&gt; THEY THINKFULLY ABLE TO
NOTIFY THE FAMILY.
I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES BROCKTON MAYOR
BILL CARPENTER SHOWN HERE ON
SCENE AND TOLD ME HE WILL BE TALKING WITH ME A LITTLE BIT
LATER ON, BUT EARLIER HE DID
CONFIRM 14-YEAR-OLD FRESHMAN FROM BROCKTON HIGH SCHOOL WAS
PERSON STRUCK HERE ON MAIN
STREET AND TAKING LOOK BEHIND ME YOU CAN SEE THIS IS RIGHT NEAR
BROCKTON FOOD MART AND THERE ARE
STILL SOME SPRAY PAINT MARKS, BOTH IN THE PARKING LOT HERE AS
WELL AS ON THE ROAD INDICATING
EXACTLY WHERE THIS ALL HAPPENED. THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE
BROCKTON SCHOOLS ALSO TOLD ME
THAT THE TEEN DID HAVE SIBLINGS AT THE ELEMENTARY AND MIDDLE
SCHOOL AND THAT GRIEF COUNSELORS
WILL BE AT ALL THREE SCHOOLS TODAY.
BUT THIS MORNING THERE'S STILL
THE QUESTION REMAINS WHAT EXACTLY LED UP TO THE CRASH.
WE WERE THERE AS INVESTIGATORS
DROVE THAT SILVER SUV INVOLVED IN THE CRASH AND FROM THE VIDEO
THAT YOU'RE SEEING YOU CAN SEE
THEM TESTING THE SUV'S BRAKES. WHAT WE KNOW IS THIS.
AROUND 6:45 LAST NIGHT TEENAGE
BOY RIDING BIKE ON MAIN STREET WHEN HIT AND KILLED BY THE SUV.
AGAIN, SO HEARTBREAKING BECAUSE
POLICE COULD NOT IMMEDIATELY IDENTIFY HIM, HIS CELL PHONE WAS
LOST, DIDN'T HAVE ANY ID ON HIM
AND DID TAKE HOURS FOR THEM TO NOTIFY HIS FAMILY AND THIS
MORNING POLICE HAVE ALSO NOT
RELEASED THE NAME OF THE 18-YEAR-OLD MALE DRIVER OF THAT
SUV.
&gt;&gt; VERY ACTIVE INVESTIGATION AND WAY TOO SOON TO KNOW IF WILL OR
WON'T BE FILED AND DRIVER
STOPPED IN AND WAS COOPERATIVE. &gt;&gt; Stephanie: WE WILL SPEAK TO
THE MAYOR AND BRING YOU MORE.
&gt;&gt; Gene: CAR ROLES OVER INTO A BUILDING IN MIDDLETON AND
DESPITE NO ONE WAS HURT.
CAR WOUND UP GETTING FLIPPED OVER, HAPPENED ON KING STREET AT
6:30 AND CAR CUT OFF AND CAUSED
ANOTHER ONE TO ROLL OVER. THE FRONT OF THE STORE WAS
DAMAGED AND BOTH CARS PULLED
FROM THE SCENE. &gt;&gt; Gene: VIDEO TAKEN 5:00 THIS
MORNING AND SMASH THROUGH FENCE
AND TOOK OUT THE FRONT STAIRS OF RESTAURANT ON RIVER STREET AND
BLUE HILL AVENUE INSPECTOR
CALLED OUT TO MAKE SURE THE BUILDING IS SAFE.
&gt;&gt; Sara: LOCAL MAN BACK ON
LAND. FIVE HOURS KEEPING HIMSELF
AFLOAT IN VERY COLD WATER AND
WENT OUT FOR SWIM IN GOT CAUGHT IN POWERFUL RIP CURRENT.
LIVE ALONG CRANE BEACH IN
IPSWICH AND MORE ON VERY HAPPY OUTCOME, MICHAEL.
&gt;&gt; Michael: PEOPLE GONE BACK
IN SINCE OCCURRED OFF THE COAST LAST NIGHT.
TWO MEN GOING IN AND COLD
TEMPERATURES AND ZERO VISIBILITY DUE TO FOG, RIP CURRENT TOOK
THEM AWAY LAUNCHING MASSIVE
RESCUE EFFORT. 58-YEAR-OLD IPSWICH MAN RANDALL
HACKETT WARMED UP IN AMBULANCE
IN CRANE BEACH PARKING LOT. REMEMBERED HACKET AND
28-YEAR-OLD SON-IN-LAW ALEXANDER
AUERBACH SEEN IN THE GRAY SWEATSHIRT AND BLACK CAP.
&gt;&gt; TURNED OUT GOOD TONIGHT AND
VERY HAPPY ABOUT THE OUTCOME. &gt;&gt; BOTH MEN ARE EXPERIENCED
SWIMMERS AND WENT FOR AFTERNOON
SWIM AROUND 4:30 TUESDAY. THEIR FAMILY WENT TO THE BEACH
TO CHECK ON THEM WHEN THEY
DIDN'T RETURN ON TIME FINDING ONLY THEIR BIKES AND CALLING
POLICE AROUND 7:20.
&gt;&gt; U.S. COAST GUARD SENT HELICOPTER TO ASSIST WITH THE
SEVEN.
&gt;&gt; Michael: AUERBACH MADE IT BACK TO SHORE SHORTLY THEREAFTER
WALKING TO THE COAST GUARD
COMMAND POST. THE COAST GUARD HELICOPTER THEN
SPOTTED HACKETT AND RESCUED HIM
AROUND 9:20. ABOUT A QUARTER MILE OFFSHORE
AND 2 MILES SOUTH OF WHERE THEY
WENT IN. THIS IS GREAT.
WE LOVE THIS.
&gt;&gt; Michael: AUERBACH DIDN'T NEED TO BE TAKEN TO THE
HOSPITAL, HACKETT DID, GETTING
TREATMENT FOR EXPOSURE AND WORKING TO GET AN UPDATE ON HIS
CONDITION THIS MORNING.
MICHAEL HENRICH, FOX25 NEWS. &gt;&gt; Gene: MAN THAT WAS
VACUUMING OUT HIS MINIVAN LAST
NIGHT IN DORCHESTER AVENUE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL AFTER MORE THAN
DOZEN SHOTS RANG OUT.
THIS IS THE SCENE AS POLICE INVESTIGATED AND 5:30 AT
INTERSECTION OF MATHER STREET.
ONE OF THE BULLETS WENT INTO THE MAN'S ARM AND TRAVELED UP TO THE
NECK.
NO ONE ELSE WAS HURT AND NO ONE HAS BEEN ARRESTED.
MOST WANTED FUGITIVES 16 YEARS
OLD. JAIDEN SMITH ACCUSED OF SHOOTING
MAN IN FALL RIVER BACK IN JULY
AND NOW SUSPECT IN SHOOTING IN NEW BEDFORD TWO WEEKS AGO.
THERE'S $1,000 REWARD LEADING TO
HIS ARREST. HE IS CONSIDERED ARMED AND
DANGEROUS.
&gt;&gt; Sara: MBTA CLOSER LOOK AT FINANCES AND FIRST STEP TOWARD
PRIVATIZING MORE PARTS OF THE
SERVICE. THE TRANSIT SYSTEM PAYING NEARLY
$1 MILLION TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF
THE "T" AND TRYING TO DETERMINE IF IT WOULD BE CHEAPER TO
PRIVATIZE THE SERVICE.
BOSTON UNION ALREADY BLASTED THE AUDIT SAYING THE MONEY SHOULD BE
GOING TO NEW BUSS AND TRAINS.
EARLIER THIS MONTH THE MBTA PROPOSED PRIVATETISING THE
AGENCY'S MONEY ROOM.
TODAY MARKS TWO WEEKS SINCE HARVARD UNIVERSITY WORKERS
STARTED THEIR STRIKE.
DINING HALL EMPLOYEES WALKED OFF THE JOB ON OCTOBER 5th CALLING
FOR HIGHER PAY AND BETTER
HEALTHCARE. THE SCHOOL SAYS ITS $31,000
WAGES ARE HIGH COMPARED TO OTHER
UNIVERSITIES AND THEY OFFERED TO PAY WEEKLY STIPEND OVER SCHOOL
BREAKS.
WORKERS SAY THE PROPOSAL IS NOT ENOUGH AND VOID TO CONTINUE THE
STRIKE UNTIL CONTRACT IS WORKED
OUT. HARVARD HAS BEEN FORCED TO CLOSE
SOME OF THE DINING HALLS AMID
THE PROTEST. STRIKE FUND IS CURRENTLY PAYING
WORKERS $200 A WEEK.
&gt;&gt; Gene: NEW POLL FRO FROM -- FROM WBUR AND HALF VOTERS
EXPECTED TO OPPOSE QUESTION TWO
NEXT MONTH. AS FOR THE LEGALIZATION OF
MARIJUANA FOR RECREATIONAL USE,
POLL SHOWS SUPPORT IS GROWING AMONG VOTERS HERE IN
MASSACHUSETTS, 55% OF PEOPLE ARE
VOTING FOR OR LEANING TOWARD VOTING FOR LEGALIZING POT.
THAT'S AN INCREASE IN SUPPORT
FROM LAST MONTH'S POLL. &gt;&gt; Julie: WE TRACK TRAFFIC AND
WEATHER TOGETHER EVERY TEN
MINUTES. IF THE PIKE EASTBOUND PART OF
THE MORNING COMMUTE, RIGHT NOW
46 MINUTE RIDE FROM 495 TO THE EXIT FOR MASS AVE.
SHIRI?
&gt;&gt; Shiri: I STILL HAVE TEMPERATURE IN THE 60s HERE
SENDING YOU INTO WORK AND THERE
ARE PASSING CLOUDS THAT WE GOT TO GET TO NOW AND GOING TO BE
BRIGHTER AND TEMPERATURES 74 TO

      <description>&gt;&gt; Daniel: TONIGHT'S DEBATE
YOU SEE THEM LISTED HERE AND
CLINTON TAKING BILLIONAIRE APPROACH TAKING TWO BIG PLAYERS
FROM THE BUSINESS WORLD.
IT IS HER ATTEMPT TO RATTLE THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE BY
QUESTIONING HIS OWN NET WORTH
AND TRUMP COMING OUT SWINGING. IT IS CONFIRMED THAT THE MOTHER
OF A BENGHAZI VICTIM WILL BE HIS
GUEST AND SHE MAY EVEN SIT IN THE FRONT ROW OF THE DEBATE.
ALSO ON LIST PRESIDENT'S HALF
BROTHER TRAVELING ALL THE WAY FROM KENYA AND LOOK AT GUEST
MAKING APPEARANCE TONIGHT.
TRUMP INVITED PATRICIA SMITH AND SHE BLAMES CLINTON FOR HER SON'S
DEATH AND LYING ABOUT THE
ATTACK. TRUMP HAS ALSO INVITED PRESIDENT
OBAMA'S HALF BROTHER SUPPORTED
TRUMP THROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN AND HAS BEEN OUTSPOKEN ABOUT
OBAMA'S ADMINISTRATION.
CLINTON BRINGING HEWLETT-PACKARD CEO AND FAILED GUBINATORIAL
CANDIDATE MEG WHITMAN.
SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT DEFECTORS FROM THE REPUBLICAN
SIDE OF THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE.
OTHER QUEST IS MARK CUBAN. HE REFERS TO HIM THE REAL
BILLIONAIRE TO UNDERCUT TRUMP'S
SUCCESS. CANDIDATES TAKING TWO DIFFERENT
APPROACHES TO THE FINAL DEBATE.
HE HAS BEEN OUT IN THE PUBLIC EYE FOR DAYS LAYING VERY LOW
UNTIL TONIGHT.
BOSTON UNIVERSITY TOM WAIL HAND SAYS SHE WILL MOST LIKELY FOCUS
ON THE WOMAN'S VOTE ON TONIGHT'S
DEBATE. &gt;&gt; I THINK SHE TRY TO BRING IN
THE WHOLE WOMAN'S ISSUE.
LOOK AT LATEST POLL NUMBERS ARE OVERWELL -- OVERWHELMINGLY
AGAINST TRUMP.
&gt;&gt; Daniel: TRUMP HAS BEEN VOCAL ABOUT THE PLAN OF ATTACK.
HE WILL HURL WIKI LEAKS ATTACKS
IN CLINTON'S DIRECTION. &gt;&gt; Gene: FINAL DEBATE WILL BE
HERE ON FOX25.
BLAIR MILLER WILL HAVE LIVE REPORT STARTING THIS AFTERNOON.
DEBATE STARTS AT 9:00 FOLLOWED
BY SPECIAL EDITION OF FOX25 NEWS AT 10:30.
&gt;&gt; Sara: JULIAN ASSANGE SAYS
HE THOUGHT THEY CUT HIS INTERNET CONNECTION.
ASSANGE LIVED IN ECUADOR EMBASSY
SINCE HE WAS GRANTED ASYLUM. &gt;&gt; Sara: LAST DAY TO REGISTER
TO VOTE AND BE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE
IN NEXT MONTH'S ELECTION. YOU CAN SIGN UP UNTIL
8:00 TONIGHT.
YOU CAN ALSO SEND IN FORM BY MAIL BUT IT HAS TO BE POST
MARKED BY TODAY.
WE HAVE LINKS WITH ALL THE INFORMATION YOU NEED TO KNOW AND
HOW TO SEE IF YOU'RE ALREADY
REGISTERED ON THE WEBSITE AT FOX25BOSTON.COM.
&gt;&gt; LIVE LOOK AT THE EXPRESSWAY
WHERE VOLUME EVEN HEAVIER THAN WE ARE USED TO SEEING.
THIS IS EXIT 13 FREEPORT STREET
AND WAITING FOR ACCIDENT TO CLEAR ON 93 NORTH.
IT IS IN THE O'NEILL TUNNEL.
THAT SLOWING THINGS DOWN AND BACKING THEM AND UP SEE THE
SOLID STEADY RED LINE OF TRAFFIC
FLOW ON THE EXPRESSWAY. AS WE SHIFT NORTHBOUND THINGS
SLUGGISH ON 128 SOUTHBOUND AS
YOU HEAD THROUGH LEXINGTON BUT WE ARE USED TO SEEING THAT KIND
OF BEHAVIOR AS FAR AS IT IS
CONCERNED AND DRIVE TIMES 49 MINUTES ON PIKE EASTBOUND FROM
495 TO MASS AVE.
48 MINUTES ON THE EXPRESSWAY, 52 MINUTES ON 93 SOUTH AS YOU
APPROACH THE LEVERETT CONNECTOR.
&gt;&gt; Gene: SUMMER LIKE FEEL AND GOOD WITH THAT.
&gt;&gt; Sara: SKY STARTING TO
CLEAR. &gt;&gt; Shiri: SHOWERS DRIED UP AND
BURST OF WARM MUGGY AIR AND
GREAT, FOLKS, FEELS LIKE SUMMER OUT THERE.
STICKY FEEL BECAUSE WE HAVE DEW
POINTS AND HIGHER THE DEW POINT TEMPERATURE THE MORE MOISTURE
AND MORE COMFORTABLESSA -- AS
YOU HAD HOME FROM WORK AND HUMIDITY TAKES A LITTLE STEP
BACK IN THE FORECAST TODAY.
68Â° TEMPERATURE RIGHT NOW AND A LITTLE WINDY ELEMENT TO THE
FORECAST AS WELL AS WE HAVE
13 MILES PER HOUR WINDS IN BOSTON, BUT GAME PLAN TODAY
INVOLVES PASSING CLOUDS THIS
MORNING, THIS AFTERNOON BRIGHT EBBS UP LOWER 70s BY
10:00 A.M., MID-70s BY NOON
TIME IN BOSTON AND SHOULD MAKE INTO UPPER 70s, SPOTS NEAR 80Â°
LATER ON TODAY AND NOT ALL COLD
FRONTS HAVE COLD AIR BEHIND THEM, SOME OF THEM HAVE DRYER
AIR BEHIND THEM AND HUMIDITY
WILL BE DROPPING FOR THE AFTERNOON.
YOU CAN SEE NOON TIME COMES
ALONG, WE ARE STILL PARTLY CLOUDY OUT THERE, GUYS, GOT A
LITTLE BIT OF MIX OF SUN AND
CLOUDS THAT WILL BE SOAKING UP, BUT AREAS NORTHWARD HERE INTO
THE AFTERNOON, FURTHER NORTH AND
WEST YOU GO, WRITER IT -- BRIGHR IT IS GOING TO BE AND LONGEST OF
ALL TODAY SO PARTLY CLOUDY
SPOTS, 75 IN SANDWICH, 73 IN VINEYARD, I GOT 80 FOR PLYMOUTH
AS WELL AS 80s IN BRIDGEWATER,
BROCKTON AND TAUNTON, HULL 77Â° AND NOT QUITE REACHING 78Â° FOR
YOU, 80Â° THOUGH IN BROOKLINE AND
FRAMINGHAM, 79 IN MAYNARD, WORCESTER TODAY 73Â°.
UPPER 70s UP INTO SOUTHERN
NEW HAMPSHIRE AND THE MERRIMACK VALLEY.
TONIGHT IT IS GOING TO BE 40s
AND 50s, COOLER. SKIES A LITTLE BIT CLEARER HERE.
YOU WILL WAKE UP AND GOING TO
FEEL LIKE FALL IN THE MORNING AND THEN FOR THE AFTERNOON IT IS
GOING TO FEEL LIKE SMALL AS
WELL, SO TASTE OF SUMMER IS BASICALLY ONE DAY DEAL WITH
HIGHS BACK IN THE LOW AND
MID-60s, THIS IS NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR.
THIS IS REALLY WHERE WE SHOULD
BE. INCREASING CLOUDS, A LOT OF DAYS
DRY, WAKE-UP WEATHER HERE GOING
TO BE DRY ASTHS BLAST OF HIGH PRESSURE.
ACTUALLY MOVED AWAY FROM US AND
ALLOW CLOUDS TO MOVE IN AND 5:00 P.M. LOOKING MOSTLY DRY AND
TIMELINE COULD SPEED UP OR SLOW
DOWN A LITTLE BIT HERE AND FIRST OF SCATTERED SHOWERS DURING THE
EVENING COMMUTE AND ESPECIALLY
PICKING UP IN COVERAGE AS WE HEAD INTO THE OVERNIGHT HOURS.
SO ON THURSDAY NIGHT WE GOT SOME
RAIN, FRIDAY MORNING. THIS IS PROBABLY THE DRYEST TIME
OF FRIDAY THERE WILL LIKELY BE
SCATTERED SHOWERS IN THE MORNING BUT REALLY THE AFTERNOON AND
EVENING THAT WE GOT BOTH FRONT
SHIFTING TOWARD US, LOW COMING UP FROM THE SOUTH DRAGGING SOME
TROPICAL MOISTURE.
SO WHEN IT ALL COMES TOGETHER, IT COULD BOIL DOWN TO A VERY WET
HERE BOTH FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND
FRIDAY AND BAD THING BECAUSE OF THE DROUGHT CONDITIONS AND
DROUGHT MONITOR ACTUALLY GOING
TO BE UPDATED TOMORROW AND HAVE THE LATEST ON THAT BUT REMEMBER
LAST WEEK WE DID SEE THE FIRST
IMPROVEMENTS OF THE SUMMER. SO AFTER FRIDAY'S RAIN, SATURDAY
DRIES OUT 60Â° AND 56 HERE ON
SUNDAY, BLUSTERY WEEKEND FEELING WHOLE LOT MORE LIKE FALL.
GENE?
&gt;&gt; Gene: POLICE OFFICER'S HOME WAS VANDALIZED WHILE FAMILY WAS

      <description>&gt;&gt; Sara: TRAUMA SURGEON AT
MASS GENERAL BEING HAILED A
SUPER DOCTOR. 2013 HE RAN THE BOSTON MARATHON

INCREDIBLE STORY. &gt;&gt; Daniel: ONE OF THE LESSONS
DR. KING LEARNED DURING SERVICE
IN IRAQ HOW TO USE ATTORNEY CAT CORRECTLY.
IT IS THAT LESSON AND TEACHING
SAVE THE LIVES OF TWO BOSTON POLICE OFFICERS.
DR. KING REINTRODUCED THE
TOURNIQUET LESSON THROUGH A PROGRAM THAT TRAINS TEACHERS,
SCHOOL NURSES AND INCLUDED A
GROUP OF BOSTON POLICE OFFICERS WHO TOOK HIS PROGRAM A WEEK
BEFORE THE EAST BOSTON SHOOTING.
DR. KING'S NAME WAS A SECRET UNTIL BILL EVANS THANKS FOR
EFFORTS AND SAVING THE POLICE
OFFICERS'S LIVES AND MENTIONED DR. KING'S NAME, WHICH IS
FAMILIAR TO US AND CONFIRMED IT
WAS THE SAME DOCTOR THAT SAVED LIVES AFTER THE MARATHON BOMBING
IN 2013.
&gt;&gt; OFFICER THAT ACTUALLY APPLIED IT CAME OFF OF TRAINING THIS
PAST THURSDAY.
SO TALK ABOUT A COINCIDENCE REALLY PAYING OFF.
&gt;&gt; Daniel: MARATHON TRIATHLON
ATHLETE SURGEON AND COMBAT VETERAN.

AND IRAQ AS U.S. ARMY LIEUTENANT COLONEL AND COMBAT SURGEON
BEFORE HE STARTED WORKING IN
MASS GENERAL IN 2008 AND SOME OF THE TRAINING HELPED TREAT
MARATHON VICTIM RIGHT AFTER THE
BOMBINGS. IN THE NEWSROOM, I'M DANIEL
MILLER, FOX25 NEWS.
&gt;&gt; Daniel: PRETTY REMARKABLE GUY.
BILL BELICHICK BECAME A
GRANDFATHER AND COMPLAINED ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY.
&gt;&gt; GIVEN THEM AS MUCH AS AS I
CAN GIVE THEM, THEY ARE JUST TOO DEPENDABLE TO ME AND ISN'T
ENOUGH CONSISTENCY IN THE
PERFORMANCE OF TABLETS SO I CAN'T TAKE IT ANY MORE.
&gt;&gt; MIGHT REMEMBER PATRIOTS HAD
PROBLEM DURING THE AFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME.
MICROSOFT ISSUED AN IMMEDIATE
STATEMENT AND HERE IT IS. WE RESPECT COACH
BELICHICK'SSTITION BUT STAND
BEHIND THE RELIABLE OF SURFACE AND CONTINUE TO RECEIVE POSITIVE
FEEDBACK ON THE SIDELINES WHERE
COACHES, PLAYERS AND ACROSS THE LEAGUE AND SIDELINE IN THE NFL

THIS MORNING 9:00 A.M. WE GOT TEMPERATURES BACK INTO THE 70s
HERE.
SEE METROWEST AND PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES CONTINUING AND SLIGHT RISK
THAT YOU GET A LITTLE SHOWER
SQUEEZED OUT ALONG WITH THE CLOUDS.
99% OF U.S. STAY DRY TODAY AND
GUESS WHAT, HERE BY NOON TIME BRIGHTENING UP, ESPECIALLY NORTH
AND WEST OF BOSTON WITH
TEMPERATURES MID AND UPPER 70s, 80s AROUND THIS
AFTERNOON, ONE SPOT THAT WATCH
FOR LINGERING CLOUDS SOUTHEASTERN MASS AND FRONT
GOING TO BE SLOWER TO PUSH AWAY
FROM YOU GUYS. EVEN THOUGH I'M SAYING COLD
FRONT, IT IS NOT COLDER THAN
YESTERDAY. IN FACT, FOR MANY OF YOU NORTH
OF BOSTON IT IS GOING TO BE
WARMER THAN IT WAS YESTERDAY. COLD FRONT IS JUST GOING TO DROP
HUMIDITY FOR THE AFTERNOON 78 IN
BOSTON, 80 TODAY IN PLYMOUTH AND GET UP TO THE 82 IN PROVIDENCE,
RHODE ISLAND, WE GOT A NEW
RECORD FOR THE DAY, 73 TODAY FOR WORCESTER, 70s TOWARD LAWRENCE
AS WELL AS FITCHBURG.
NOW, TONIGHT WE WILL BE BACK INTO THE 40s AND 50s.
COOLER OVERNIGHT AND WAKE UP
TOMORROW MORNING TO THE TEMPERATURES, IT IS GOING TO
FEEL A LITTLE MORE LIKE FALL AND
THEN DURING THE AFTERNOON LOW AND MID-60s WHICH IS NORMAL
FOR THIS TIME OF THE YEAR, IT IS
GOING TO BE QUITE THE COOLDOWN. TOMORROW NOT PICTURE PERFECT,
ALTHOUGH WE DO START WITH SOME
SUNSHINE HERE. YOU WILL FIND CLOUDS CREEPING IN
DURING THE DAY.
I FROZEN FUTURE CAST HERE AT 5:00 P.M.
JUST BECAUSE I WANT TO POINT OUT
A LOT OF TOMORROW IS RUNNING DRY.
IT IS REALLY AS WE GET TO THE
EVENING COMMUTE AND BEYOND THAT WE START WATCHING FOR THIS
SCATTERED RAIN MOVING IN AND
FROM THAT POINT FORWARD INTO YOUR FRIDAY WE ARE JUST GOING TO
HAVE TO BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR
THE SHOWERS. TO ME FRIDAY MORNING DOESN'T
LOOK LIKE WASHOUT AND ONCE WE
HIT THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING I THINK VERY WELL COULD BE.
WE GOT THE ONE WEATHER SYSTEM
THAT'S GOING TO BE DRAGGING COLD FRONT AND AREA OF LOW PRESSURE
COMING UP FROM THE SOUTH
DRAGGING TROPICAL MOISTURE AND THAT COULD ACTUALLY HELP FUEL
DOWNPOURS.
SO RAIN TOTALS ON FRIDAY COULD END UP IMPRESSIVE HALF INCH TO
INCH OF RAIN AND ONLY HELP US
WITH THE DROUGHT SITUATION SO TAKE WHATEVER WE CAN GET.
AND 7-DAY FORECAST ALWAYS IN
VIEW 80Â° TODAY AND PARTLY SUNNY SKIES WE GOT ONLY 60 FOR HIGH
TOMORROW AND DEVELOPING RAIN.
FRIDAY ON AND OFF SHOWERS THROUGHOUT THE RAIN, HEAVIEST
AND STEADIEST SECOND HALF AT
THINGS GOING TO COOLDOWN AND 60 ON SATURDAY AS WE DRY OUT IT
DOES TURN BREEZY, GOING TO BE A
WIND BLOWN WEEKEND AND CONSIDERING TRAVELING AT ALL AND
LOVE THE LEAVES, OF COURSE,
TEMPERATURES COOLER FOR SUNDAY CONCORD, NEW HAMPSHIRE, 52Â°,
PORTLAND, MAINE 50, BURLINGTON,
VERMONT ONLY 49Â° AND HYANNIS 56, SO CHILLY.
DON'T RECOMMEND ON SATURDAY
GOING TOO FAR NORTH BECAUSE LINGERING SHOWERS AND OVERALL
THE WEEKEND IS LOOKING MOSTLY
DRY. &gt;&gt; Gene: YOU HAVE BEEN TELLING
US IT MIGHT HIT 80 BUT ONE LOCAL
TOWN IT IS GOING TO LOOK A LOT LIKE CHRISTMAS.
DECORATED FOR THE HOLIDAYS AND
FAMILY TELLS US THEY LIKE TO GET OUT THERE NOW AND GET IT DONE
BEFORE IT GETS COLD.
&gt;&gt; GET OUT OF THE WAY. THAT CAN RELAX.
&gt;&gt; FAMILY TURNED THE LIGHTS ON
JUST FOR US BUT SAY TYPICALLY THEY DON'T POWER UP UNTIL A
LITTLE BIT LATER IN THE SEASON.
NEIGHBORHOOD IN SAUGUS, BY THE WAY, DRAWS A LOT OF CARS.
THEY COME AROUND TO SEE THE
LIGHTS DURING THE HOLIDAY SEASON.

      <description>BOTH THE SUPERINTENDENT AND THE

VICTIM WAS A BROCKTON HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT, A FRESHMAN, AND
JUST 14 YEARS OLD.
THEY ALSO SAID THAT HE HAS SIBLINGS AT ELEMENTARY AND
MIDDLE SCHOOL AND GRIEF
COUNSELORS WILL BE AT ALL THREE SCHOOLS TODAY.
NOW THAT SUN IS UP, I DO WANT TO
SHOW YOU EXACTLY WHERE THIS ALL HAPPENED.
THIS IS ON MAIN STREET NEAR THE
BROCKTON FOOD MART. MEANTIME THIS MORNING THERE'S
STILL THE QUESTION OF WHAT
EXACTLY LED UP TO THIS CRASH. WE WERE THERE LAST NIGHT AS
INVESTIGATORS DROVE THE SILVER
SUV INVOLVED IN THAT CRASH AND FROM THIS VIDEO YOU COULD SEE
THAT THEY WERE TESTING THE SUV'S
BRAKES. WHAT WE KNOW IS THIS.
AROUND 6:45 LAST NIGHT THE
14-YEAR-OLD WAS RIDING HIS BIKE HERE ON MAIN STREET WHEN HE WAS
HIT AND KILLED BY THE SUV, AND
WHAT IS SO HEARTBREAKING IS THAT POLICE WERE NOT ABLE TO IDENTIFY
HIM FOR SEVERAL HOURS.
THEY DID FIND HIS CELL PHONE BUT THEY COULDN'T ACCESS HIS
CONTACTS BECAUSE IT WAS LOST,
AND IT TOOK HOURS FOR THEM TO FINALLY NOTIFY HIS FAMILY.
THIS MORNING POLICE STILL HAVE
NOT RELEASED HIS NAME OR THE NAME OF THE 18-YEAR-OLD MALE
DRIVER OF THAT SUV.
&gt;&gt; WERE VERY ACTIVE INVESTIGATION.
WAY TOO SOON TO KNOW IF CHARGES
WILL OR WON'T BE FILED BUT THE DRIVER DID STOP AND WAS
COOPERATIVE.
&gt;&gt; Stephanie: THE PLYMOUTH COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY IS NOW
HANDLING THIS INVESTIGATION.
I ALSO REACHED OUT TO THEM AND AM WAITING TO HEAR BACK, AND
COMING UP IN 30 MINUTES, THE
EXTREME LENGTHS POLICE WENT AND TOOK TO FINALLY NOTIFY THE
VICTIM'S FAMILY.
IN BROCKTON, I'M STICK, FOX25 NEWS.
&gt;&gt; Gene: THIS MORNING A MAN IS
IN SERIOUS CONDITION AFTER WALKING INTO PATH OF PICKUP
TRUCK.
THE MAN STEPPED OFF THE CURB AT RIVERSIDE STREET IN LOWELL LAST
NIGHT.
FIRST RESPONDERS WANTED TO FLY HIM INTO BOSTON BUT THEY
COULDN'T GET A HELICOPTER
BECAUSE OF THE FOGGY CONDITIONS. THE WOMAN THAT WAS DRIVING THE
CAR IS COOPERATING WITH POLICE.
NEIGHBORS TELL THE LOWELL SUN THAT WRECKS OFTEN HAPPEN AT THIS
INTERSECTION.
&gt;&gt; Sara: A LOCAL MAN HAS BEEN FOUND ALIVE AFTER SPENDING
NEARLY FIVE HOURS IN VERY COLD
WATER. RESCUE CREWS SAY THE MAN WENT
OUT FOR A SWIM WITH THE
SON-IN-LAW WHEN THE TWO MEN GOT CAUGHT IN A POWERFUL RIP
CURRENT.
MICHAEL HENRICH IS LIVE ALONG CRANE BEACH IN IPSWICH ON MORE
OF MIRACULOUS OUTCOME, MICHAEL.
&gt;&gt; Michael: RESPONDERS SAY THEY ARE SO RELIEVED BECAUSE THE
WATER WAS COLD, VISIBILITY
BECAUSE OF FOG WAS DOWN TO ZERO, AND YET THEY WERE STILL ABLE TO
RESCUE THESE TWO MEAN WHO WERE
TREADING WATER FOR HOURS AFTER BEING TAKEN AWAY BY A RIP
CURRENT.
AFTER TREADING FOR NEARLY FIVE HOURS IN 59 DEGREE WATER,
58-YEAR-OLD IPSWICH MABE,
RANDALL HACKETT, WARMED UP IN AN AMBULANCE IN THE CRANE BEACH
PARKING LOT.
LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES RESCUED HACKETT AND HIS
SON-IN-LAW ALEXANDER AUERBACH.
&gt;&gt; WE ARE VERY HAPPY ABOUT THE OUTCOME.
&gt;&gt; Michael: POLICE SAY BOTH
MEN ARE EXPERIENCED SWIMMERS AND WORE WET SUITS WHEN THEY WENT
FOR AN AFTERNOON SWIM AROUND
4:30 TUESDAY. THEIR FAMILY WENT TO THE BEACH
TO CHECK ON THEM WHEN THEY
DIDN'T RETURN ON TIME, FINDING ONLY THEIR BIKES AND CALLING
POLICE AROUND 7:20.
&gt;&gt; U.S. CORING SENT A JAYHAWK HELICOPTER TO ASSIST WITH THE
SEARCH, THE FIRE DEPARTMENT
LAUNCHED THEIR BOAT. &gt;&gt; Michael: AUERBACH MADE IT
BACK TO SHORE SHORTLY
THEREAFTER, WALKING TO THE COAST GUARD COMMAND COAST.
THE COAST GUARD HELICOPTER THEN
SPOTTED HACKETT AND RESCUED HIM AROUND 9:00 20.
ABOUT A QUARTER MILE OFFSHORE
AND 2 MILES SOUTH OF WHERE THEY WENT IN.
&gt;&gt; LOVE WHEN THIS HAPPENS.
WE LOVE TO FIND PEOPLE. THIS IS OUR JOB, AND WE ARE
HAPPY TO SEE A GREAT OUTCOME.
THIS IS GREAT. WE LOVE THIS.
&gt;&gt; Michael: HACKETT WAS TAKEN
TO THE HOSPITAL FOR TREATMENT FOR EXPOSURE, WHILE AUERBACH WAS
SENT HOME WITH HIS FAMILY IN A
REGULAR OLD CAR AFTER THIS LARGE SCALE EFFORT TO RESCUE THEM
BOTH.

WHEN THINGS GO BADLY YOU START BLAMING SOMEBODY ELSE YOU DON'T

TODAY.
&gt;&gt; Shiri: IT IS GOING TO BE A GREAT DAY.
TEMPERATUREWISE GOING TO BE VERY
COME FORTUNATABLE, FLAVOR OF SUMMER IN THE AIR BECAUSE OF THE
HUMIDITY.
GOT THE PICTURE IN ON TWITTER THIS MORNING, THIS IS FROM
ROBERT OF THE ESSEX CLOUDS OVER
THE MARSHES THERE AND YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES
COMING THROUGH.
NOT LIKE CLOUDS TOTALLY TAKE OVER TODAY.
WE JUST GOT A PERIOD OF CLOUDY
WEATHER THAT WE GOT TO GET THROUGH HERE THIS MORNING AND IT
IS STICKY OUT THERE BECAUSE DO
UPTEMPERATURES IN THE SIXTIES, HIGHER THE NUMBER THE MORE
MOISTURE IN THE AIR AND MUGGIER
IT IS. THE NICE THING IS WE GOT
DROPPING HUMIDITY TODAY, SO BY
THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING YOU'RE GOING TO NOTICE HOW MUCH MORE
COMFORTABLE IT FEELS.
67Â° RIGHT NOW IN BOSTON. WE GOT 15 MILES PER HOUR BREEZE.
THAT'S THE OTHER THING I WANT
YOU TO BE AWARE OF THIS MORNING, BUT IT IS GOING TO BE A LITTLE
BREEZY IN PARTICULAR OUT ACROSS
THE COST AND DOWN TO THE CAPE. WE GOT EARLY MORNING CLOUDS
COPING WITH HERE.
ONLY GOING TO SQUEEZE OUT MAYBE ISOLATED SHOWER AT BEST.
99% OF YOU ARE GOING TO STAY
DRY, 11:00 A.M. 74Â°, 1:00 P.M. 76, WITHY HEAD INTO THE UPPER
SEVENTIES MOST AREAS INCREASING
SUNSHINE FROM NORTH TO SOUTH BEHIND THE FRONT LATER TODAY.
YOU CAN SEE SHOWERS THAT WERE
AROUND EARLIER THIS MORNING IN AREAS LIKE NEW HAMPSHIRE, MAINE,
VERMONT, KIND OF MELTING AWAY.
FRONT COMING THROUGH JUST DRAGGING CLOUDS FOR MANY OF US.
BETWEEN EIGHT AND NINE I'M GOING
TO BE WATCHING THE BOSTON AREA FOR THE SLIGHT RISK OF SPRINKLE
COMING THROUGH LATE-MORNING THE
CHANCE WILL SIT OVER SOUTHEASTERN MASSACHUSETTS.
YOU CAN SEE THE CLOUDS HAVING A
LITTLE TOUGHER TIME BREAKING UP OVER SOUTHEASTERN MASS AND
OVERALL LOOKING MUCH BRIGHTER
THIS AFTERNOON, STILL GOING TO BE VERY WARM AND GOOD THING
ABOUT TODAY'S FORECAST IS
ACTUALLY GOING TO BE WIDESPREAD, WARMTH NOT JUST CONFINED TO
SOUTHEASTERN MASSACHUSETTS LIKE
IT WAS YESTERDAY. SO 88 PLYMOUTH, 81 IN
BRIDGEWATER, 81 IN BROCKTON,
BOSTON TODAY ABOUT 78Â°. SAME TEMPERATURE READING IN
LAWRENCE, LOWELL, NASHUA 77, I
GOT 78 IN WESTBORO, 73 IN WORCESTER, HOW ABOUT 80 IN
FOXBOROUGH TODAY AND REMEMBER
INCREASING SUNSHINE, FURTHER NORTH YOU GO AND START TOMORROW
WITH SOME SUN IN THE MORNING,
EXPECT INCREASING CLOUDS AS THIS FRONT SHIFTS TOWARD US AND THEN
AREN'T DINNER TIME OR AROUND THE
EVENING COMMUTE WE START TO SEE SOME SHOWERS POP UP AND THAT'S
SOMETHING THAT WE ARE GOING TO
BE WATCHING INTO THE THURSDAY EVENING AND OVERNIGHT.
FRIDAY GETS EVEN WETTER.
WE GOT THE ONE FRONT MOVING TOWARD US AND ANOTHER AREA OF
LOW PRESSURE THAT'S COMING UP
FROM THE SOUTH AND IT IS GOING TO BE DRAGGING TROPICAL MOSTLY
SUNNY INTO PLACE AND THAT COULD
REALLY FUEL SOME DOWNPOURS HERE FOR THE DAY ON FRIDAY, SO WE ARE
LOOKING AT ANYWHERE FROM HALF
INCH OF RAIN TO INCH OF RAIN ON FRIDAY.
THAT'S GOING TO BE THE SOAKER OF
THE WEEK. 7-DAY FORECAST FOR THE WEEKEND
IN VIEW HAS US CLOSE TOATE
TODAY, PARTLY SUNNY SKIES, SOME OF YOU EVEN GET UP TO 80Â° BUT
COOLER DAY TOMORROW AT 64 WITH
INCREASING CLOUDS EXAMINE DEVELOPING SHOWERS.
ON AND OFF RAIN HERE ON FRIDAY
AND 70Â°, WEEKEND COOLS DOWN, IT IS GOING TO TURN BREEZY ON
SATURDAY, ONLY SLIGHT RISK OF
MORNING SHOWER AND 60Â°. YOU'RE GOING TO WAKE UP TO FROST
AND HE FREEZING TEMPERATURE HERE
SUNDAY MORNING. 56 THAT'S IT FOR THE HIGH, IT IS
GOING TO FEEL LIKE FALL AGAIN
BETWEEN THE CHILLY TEMPERATURES AND THE WIND.
IT STAYS PRETTY BREEZY INTO THE
MONDAY LIKELY AS WELL AS WE GOT A FEW SHOWERS COMING THROUGH IN
THE MORNING AND TEMPERATURES
HIGHS IN THE 50s, REALLY RULING AS WE GET INTO NEXT
WORKWEEK.
SARA? &gt;&gt; Sara: STRANDED ON LAKE
MICHIGAN.
THIS WIND SURFER RESCUED BY THE COAST GUARD BECAUSE HE
REMEMBERED TO BRING HIS CELL
PHONE WITH HIM. THE WIND SURFER MASS BROKE MILES
FROM SHORE AND COULDN'T MAKE IT

&gt;&gt;&gt; POLICE SPENT HOURS
OVERNIGHT INVESTIGATING THE DEATH OF A LOCAL TEENAGER
KILLED WHILE RIDING HIS BIKE.
THEY EVEN DROVE THAT VEHICLE AT THE SCENE AND SLAMMED ON THE
BRAKES.
&gt;&gt; Gene:  THE BIG PROBLEM THAT POLICE HAD NO WAY TO IDENTIFY
THAT YOUNG VICTIM.
STEPHANIE COUEIGNOUX IS LIVE IN BROCKTON WHERE SOME OF THE WAYS
THEY TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHO HE
WAS. GOOD MORNING, STEPHANIE.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: GENE, THE PROBLEM
WAS THE TEEN DID NOT HAVE HIS ID ON HIM.
THEY DID FIND HIS CELL PHONE
HERE AT THE SCENE ON MAIN STREET JUST NEAR THE BROCKTON
FOOD MART, BUT THEY COULDN'T
USE IT BECAUSE IT WAS LOCKED. THEY EVEN HAD A SCHOOL EMPLOYEE
COME AND IDENTIFY HIM.
THIS MORNING, WE STILL DO NOT KNOW THE TEAM'S NAME OR HIS
AGE.
WE DO WANT TO SHOW YOU SOME VIDEO FROM LAST NIGHT AND FROM
THIS VIDEO, YOU CAN SEE THE
FRONT OF THE SILVER SUV INVOLVED IN THIS CRASH DENTED
FROM THE IMPACT AND THE
VICTIM'S BIKE ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.
THIS ALL HAPPENED AROUND 6:30
LAST NIGHT. AND POLICE SPENT HOURS
INVESTIGATING.
THIS MORNING, THOUGH, WE ARE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT
HAPPENED.
WE DID SEE THEM TESTING THE BRAKES ON THAT SUV TO CHECK FOR
ANY MECHANICAL FAILURES, ALL OF
THIS WAS HAPPENING AS POLICE WAS TRYING TO NOTIFY THE
VICTIM'S FAMILY.
THEY WERE FINALLY ABLE TO DO THAT AT AROUND 11:00 LAST
NIGHT.
ACCORDING TO THE BROCKTON ENTERPRISE, HAD THE HIGH
SCHOOL'S ATHLETIC DIRECTOR COME
TO THE SCENE TO LOOK THROUGH STUDENT PHOTOS TO TRY TO
IDENTIFY THE TEEN.
THIS MORNING WE DO NOT HAVE THAT STUDENT'S NAME.
WE ARE ASKING WHETHER HE WAS A
STUDENT AT HIGH SCHOOL OR POSSIBLY A MIDDLE SCHOOL
STUDENT OR REQUEST GRIEF
COUNSELORS WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR STUDENTS TODAY.
POLICE ARE NOT RELEASED THE
NAME THE DRIVER. HE IS 18 YEARS OLD.
HE DID STAY ON SCENE AND
COOPERATED WITH MISS. WITNESSES DESCRIBE HIM AS BEING
ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATED.
 SO FAR NO CHARGES HAVE BEEN FILED AND I HAVE REACHED OUT TO
THE MAYOR AS WELL AS POLICE AND
PASS ALONG ANY INFORMATION AS SOON AS I RECEIVE IT.
IN BOSTON, STEPHANIE

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; 5:50 NOW ON THIS -- ON THIS
WEDNESDAY.
IT IS WEDNESDAY, RIGHT IN. &gt;&gt; Gene:  IT IS WEDNESDAY.
&gt;&gt; HUMP DAY AND NOT REQUESTING
TO BE THE BEST HAIR DAY EVER BECAUSE THE HUMIDITY, BUT
THAT'S FINE.
&gt;&gt; NO. A QUICK LITTLE CHECK HERE.
HUMIDITY IN PLACE TODAY.
HEAT IN PLACE TODAY AS WELL. UP KNOW EVERYTHING KIND OF SAYS
SUMMER ABOUT THE FORECAST.
THESE ARE YOUR RECORD HIGHS. I DON'T THINK WE WILL GET UP TO
84 IN BOSTON TO TIE THAT
RECORD. PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND.
A SPOT TO GET UP TO THAT RECORD
HIGH OF 81 DEGREES. REST OF US UPPER 70s, OTHER
80s, BUT AT LEAST TODAY THE
WARM WEATHER IS WIDESPREAD. WE HAVE A FRONT THAT IS COMING
THROUGH BUT NOT ALL COLD FRONTS
BRING IN COLD AIR AND SOME OF THEM BRING IN DRY AIR AND THIS
IS HAPPENING TODAY.
HUMIDITY WILL BE DROPPING AS THE DAY GOES ON.
THE CLOUDS WILL STIR UP A
SPRINKLE OR TWO IN SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND.
BY 8 A.M., THE RAIN CHANCES ARE
KIND OF OVERDONE AND WE WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE AREAS THAT WILL
SEE THIS QUICK LITTLE SPRINKLE.
THE NORTH SHORE WITH A CHANCE OF A SHOWER UPPER 50s FROM
BEDFORD AND WORCESTER AT 8 A.M.
IT WILL BE APPROACHING BOSTON AT 8 A.M. WITH SOME OF THOSE
THICKER CLOUDS BY 10 A.M.
THE RAIN CHANCES FROM BOSTON NORTH AND WEST ARE GOING TO BE
OVER, AND THEN THE FOCUS TURNS
INTO SOUTHEASTERN MASSACHUSETTS.
NOONTIME YOU CAN SEE
TEMPERATURES IN THE MID- TO UPPER 70s.
THICKEST CLOUDS SOUTH OF BOSTON
AND, AGAIN, SLIGHT RISK YOU WILL GET A LITTLE SPRINKLE OUT
OF THAT CLOUD COVER BUT OVERALL
FROM NORTH TO SOUTH, WE CLEAR OUT SLOWLY THIS AFTERNOON.
TEMPERATURE-WISE HERE POPS OF
80s AT 3 P.M. FOR THE KIDS COMING OFF THE BUS COMING HOME
FROM SCHOOL.
DEFINITELY WARM AND WE ARE STARTING WARM THIS MORNING.
WE CAN ALMOST DRESS FOR AUGUST
TODAY AS OPPOSED TO OCTOBER. 78 YOUR HIGH IN BOSTON AND
IPSWICH, 80 IN PLYMOUTH.
81 IN NORWOOD. 82  IN PROVIDENCE, RHODE
ISLAND.
73 IN WORCESTER. 78 IN LAWRENCE 76 IN
MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE.
TONIGHT IN THE 40s AND 50s. A LITTLE COOLER.
AND LOWER 60s.
MUCH MORE FALL-LIKE. MORE SEASONABLE FOR YOUR
THURSDAY.
RAIN DEVELOPS LATE IN THE DAY. WE HAVE A RAINY FRIDAY AT 70
DEGREES WITH ON-AND-OFF
SHOWERS. SATURDAY DRIES OUT, BREEZY AND
60 DEGREES AND THEN THE WEEKEND
REALLY COOLS ON ON SUNDAY WITH A HIGH OF 56.
WE ARE STILL LOOKING AT WINDY
CONDITIONS. THE CHANCE FOR RAIN IS GOING TO
COME BACK INTO PLAY HERE EARLY
ON MONDAY BUT I THINK COOLER TEMPERATURES DEFINITELY NOW
SHAPING UP FOR NEXT WEEK.
GET YOU OVER TO JULIE GRAUERT WITH LIVE DRIVE TIME TRAFFIC
STARTING SOUTH OF BOSTON.
&gt;&gt; Julie:  SOUTH OF TOWN MOVING ALONG NICELY.
ROUTE 3 NOT BRINGING YOU RUN
TO. AS YOU APPROACH THE BRAINTREE
SPLIT AND NOTHING MAJOR.
24 2/4 AND 95 ARE CLEAR AS YOU HEAD UP THIS HE WILL BETHROUGH
CANTON.
PEOPLE ARE GETTING UP AND HEADING OUT THE DOOR.
GIVE US ANOTHER 45 MINUTES AND
THAT'S WHEN WE WILL START TO SEE SOME SLOWDOWNS.
LIVE DRIVE TILES.
15 MINUTES ON ROUTE 3 FROM 228 TO THE SPLIT.
18 MINUTES ON 24.
19 MINUTES ON THE EXPRESSWAY AS APPROACH COLUMBIA ROAD.
BACK TO YOU.
&gt;&gt; THE MBTA TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT ITS FINANCES,  AND THIS
IS THE FIRST STEP TOWARD
PRIVATIZING THE SERVICE. THE TRANSIT SYSTEM IS PAYING $1
MILLION FOR A CONSULTANT TO
BREAK DOWN THE COST OF RUNNING VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE T AND
TRYING TO DETERMINE IF IT WAS
CHEAPER TO PRIVATIZE THE SERVICE.
THEY BLASTED THEM SAYING THE
MONEY SHOULD BE GOING TO BUSES AND TRAINS.
EARLIER THIS MONTH THEY WANTED
TO PRIVATIZE THE AGENCY'S MONEY</description>

ENOUGH TO STEP BACK BUT THE DOG
BELLA WAS HIT IN THE ROAD AND SHE DIED ON THE WAY TO THE
HOSPITAL.
&gt;&gt; MY NIECE WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO TAKE ONE STEP BACK, BUT NOT
ENOUGH TIME TO PULL THE DOGS

      <description>.
&gt;&gt;&gt; A TRAUMA SURGEON AT MASS
GENERAL MIGHT BE KNOWN AS A SUPER DOCTOR IN 2013, DR. DAVID
KING MANATEE BOSTON MARATHON
AND SHORTLY AFTER FINISHING WENT TO WORK HELPING PEOPLE
WOUNDED IN THE BOMBING.
THE CRED I HATE IT OFFICER IS NOW GETTING TO SAVE TWO KHAWVRS
BEFORE THEY GOT TO THE
HOSPITAL. &gt;&gt; ONE OF THINGS THAT THEY
LEARNED WAS HOW TO CORRECTLY
USE A TOURNIQUET. THAT LESSON AND TEACHING THAT
HELPED SAVE THE YOU LIVES OF
TWO BOSTON POLICE OFFICERS. DR. KING INTRODUCED THE
TRAINING PROGRAM THAT INCLUDED
SCHOOL NURSES, TEACHERS AND BOSTON POLICE.
THEY CREDITED THAT TRAINING
WITH KEEPING THEIR BROTHER OFFICERS ALIVE UNTIL THEY GOT
TO MGH.
IT WAS A SECRET UNTIL THE DOCTOR THANKED THE MEDICAL TEAM
FOR THEIR EFFORTS IN HELPING TO
SAVE THE LIVES OF THOSE OFFICERS.
THE COMMISSIONER ALSO MENTIONED
DR. KING'S NAME WHICH WAS FAMILIAR TO US.
SO POLICE SOURCES CONFIRM THAT
IT WAS INDEED THE SAME DOCTOR WHO HO SAVED LIVES AFTER THE
MARATHON BOMB INFORMATION 20.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; THE OFFICER WHO ACTUALLY
APPLIED IT JUST CAME OFF OF
TRAINING THIS PAST THURSDAY. SO YOU TALK ABOUT A COINCIDENCE
REALLY PAYING OFF.
&gt;&gt; Daniel:  DR. KING'S TWITTER PAGE LISTS HIM AS AN IRON MAN,
TRY ATHLETE, SURGEON, COMBAT
VETERAN. HE WAS DEPLOYED AS ASY
ARMY.COMBAT SURGEON BEFORE HE
STARTED WORKING AT MASS GENERAL IN 2008.
GENE AND SARA, AT SOME POINT
THIS VICTIM HELPED THE VICTIMS RIGHT AFTER THE MARATHON
BOMBINGS.
JUST AN INCREDIBLE PERSON. &gt;&gt; Sara:  WHAT A FULL LIFE HE
HAS LED IN.
&gt;&gt; Daniel:  I CALL HIM A SUPER DOCTOR.
&gt;&gt; Gene:  ALL THIS TRAINING IS
IMPORTANT. PAY ATTENTION WHEN YOU ARE
GOING THROUGH IT.
THAT DOES IT FOR THIS HOUR.</description>

NO CHARGES HAVE BEEN FILED.
&gt;&gt;&gt; A LEVEL 3 SEX OFFENDER WITH 18 CONVICTIONS IS HEADED BACK
TO COURT.
POLICE ARRESTED DARREN GRANT FOR EXPOSING HIMSELF.
FOX25'S CATHERINE PARROTTA IS
LIVE AT WRENTHAM DISTRICT COURT.
CATHERINE, POLICE SAY THAT
GRANT WAS FOLLOWING A BUS FULL OF TEENAGED GIRLS.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: AND BECAUSE OF
THAT HE IS BACK BEHIND BARS THIS MORNING AND POLICE SAY IT
WAS IN PART THANKS TO THE QUICK
THINKING OF ONE OF THE TEENAGERS ON BOARD THAT BUS
THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO CATCH UP
WITH HIM SO QUICKLY. ALL OF THIS UNFOLDED LATE
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON AND
HAPPENED ON ROUTE 1 A  NEAR NORFOLK AGRICULTURE HIGH
SCHOOL.
DARREN GRANT WAS FOLLOWING A BUS FULL OF SCHOOLS HEADED TO A
VOLLEYBALL GAME.
AT SOME POINT HE PULLED ALONG SIDE THAT BUS AND EXPOSED
HIMSELF.
ONE OF THE TEENS SNAPPED A PICTURE AND TOLD A CHAPERONE.
&gt;&gt; IMMEDIATELY THE OFFICERS
RESPONDING TO THAT SCENE KNEW THAT WAS THE AREA OF A LEVEL 3
SEX OFFENDER.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: GRANT WAS WEARING A GPS MONITORING BRACELET WHICH
ALLOWED POLICE TO TRACK HIM
DOWN IN WEYMOUTH. RIGHT NOW HE IS BEING HELD ON
$50,000 CASH BAIL.
AGAIN, HE IS EXPECTED TO BE HERE IN COURT IN WRENTHAM
TODAY.
IN THE MEANTIME, WE WILL TELL YOU WHAT WE LEARNED OF HIS PAST
AND WHY NEIGHBORS WERE SO
SURPRISED HE WAS LIVING AT HIS CURRENT ADDRESS.
WE WILL HAVE THAT ALL LIVE IN
THE NEXT HOUR, CATHERINE</description>

      <description>PARROTTA, FOX25 NEWS.
&gt;&gt;&gt; FOUND ALIVE, A MAN MISSING
FOR HOURS AFTER A SWIM WITH HIS SON-IN-LAW HAS BEEN RESCUED
FROM A NORTH SHORE BEACH.
WE FOLLOWED THE RESCUE ALL NIGHT.
THE FIRST CALL FOR A MISSING
SWIMMER AT CRANE BEACH CAME IN AROUND 5 P.M. LCHL FIVE HOURS
LATER HE WAS PULLED OUT OF THE
COLD WATER. FOX25'S TED DANIEL WENT TO THE
SCENE TO FIND OUT HOW THE MAN
SURVIVED. &gt;&gt; Reporter: OUT OF THE WATER
SAFE AND SOUND.
THE 58-YEAR-OLD IPSWICH MAN IN AN AMBULANCE IN THE CRANE BEACH
PARKING LOT.
HIS ADULT SON AND OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS OUTSIDE WITH SOME OF
THE MANY FIRST RESPONDERS
INVOLVED IN RESCUING THE PAIR. &gt;&gt; THESE THINGS DON'T USUALLY
TURN THOUGHT GOOD AND IT TURNED
OUT GOOD. WE ARE VERY HAPPY ABOUT THE
OUTCOME.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: FATHER AND SON ARE EXPERIENCED SWIMMERS AND
OUTFITTED IN WET SUITS WHEN
THEY WENT IN THE WATER AROUND 4:30 IN THE AFTERNOON.
WHEN THEY DIDN'T RETURN HOME ON
TIME. FAMILY MEMBERS CAME DOWN TO THE
BEACH TO CHECK ON THEM.
THEY FOUND BOTH OF THEIR BIKES, BUT THE FATHER AND SON WERE NOT
ON THE BEACH.
THE FAMILY NOTIFIED POLICE AT 7:20 AND A MASSIVE SEARCH WAS
LAUNCHED.
&gt;&gt; U.S. COAST GUARD SENT A JAYHAWK HELICOPTER TO HELP WITH
THE SEARCH.
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT LAUNCHED THEIR BOAT.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: AFTER THE SEARCH
BEGAN THE SUN IDENTIFIED AS THE MAN IN THE GRAY SWEATSHIRT AND
THE BLACK CAP WAS ABLE TO MAKE
IT TO THE SHORE ON HIS OWN. HE WALKED TO THE DEMAND POST
AND CONFIRMED THAT THE FATHER
WAS STILL MISS APPROXIMATING IN 59-DEGREE WATER, THE COAST
GUARD HELICOPTER SPOTTED THE
FATHER A QUARTER MILE OFFSHORE AND TWO MILES SOUTH WHERE HE
WENT IN.
A RESCUE SWIMMER WAS DEPLOYED AND SCOOPED THE MAN UP TO
SAFETY.
&gt;&gt; WE LOVE WHEN THIS HAPPENS. WE LOVE TO FIND PEOPLE.
WE ARE HAPPY -- HAPPY TO SEE A
GREAT OUTCOME. THIS IS GREAT.
WE LOVE THIS.
&gt;&gt; Daniel:  THAT WAS TED DANIEL REPORTING.
IPSWICH POLICE HAVE IDENTIFIED
TWO MEN INVOLVED. THE ONE IN THE ORANGE HAT
RANDALL HACK DEFENDANT IPSWICH
AND THE SON ALEXANDER AUBACH OF EDGARTOWN.
THE WATER WAS JUST 59 DEGREES
LAST NIGHT SO THOSE WET SUITS WERE CRITICAL FOR THE PAIR'S
SURVIVAL.
THEY WERE EXPERIENCES A KING TIDE THE HIGHEST PREDICTED HIGH
TIDE OF THE YEAR.
THE MIX FOR THE RIP CURRENTS AND THE TIDES PULL AWAY AS THE
DISAPPEARANCE AND SEARCH.
THE ENTIRE AREA WAS BLANKETED IN FOG.

      <description>IN 2013, DR. DAVID KING RAN THE
BOSTON MARATHON AND SHORTLY
AFTER FINISHING WENT TO WORK TO TREAT PEOPLE WOUNDED IN THE
BOMBING.
&gt;&gt; Julie:  PART OF THE TEAM OF DOCTOR ARES THAT SAVED THE TWO
OFFICERS SHOT IN BOSTON TWO
DAYS AGO. THE DOCTOR AND HIS TEAM
ACTUALLY SAVED THE OFFICERS'
LIVES WELL BEFORE THEY GOT INTO THE OPERATING ROOM.
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF A TOURNIQUET
TRAINING PROGRAM THAT HE STARTED.
OFFICERS AT THE SCENE OF LAST
WEEK'S SHOOTING HAD JUST GONE THROUGH THAT PROGRAM A WEEK
BEFORE, AND THEY SAY WHAT THEY
LEARNED KEPT THOSE TWO OFFICERS ALIVE UNTIL THEY GOT TO MASS
GENERAL FOR SURGERY.
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO ONCE AGAIN THANK THE TEAM UP IN MASS GENERAL
ESPECIALLY DR. KING.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: BOSTON POLICE COMMISSIONER BILL EVANS THANKS
THE MGH MEDICAL TEAM INCLUDING
A DR. KING. THAT NAIM SOUNDED FAMILIAR TO
US.
POLICE SOURCES CONFIRM TO FOX25 THAT IT IS INDEED DR. DAVID
KING, THE SAME DOCTOR WHO SAVED
LIVES AFTER THE MARATHON BOMBINGS IN 2013, THE SAME
DOCTOR WHO HAD JUST FINISHED
THE MARATHON HIMSELF, THEN JUMPED INTO A MARATHON OF
SURGERIES TO SAVE BOMBING
VICTIMS, AND THE SAME DOCTOR WHO WAS IN SURGERY OPERATING ON
AT LEAST ONE OF THE BOSTON
POLICE OFFICERS GUNNED DOWN ANSWERING A DOMESTIC CALL LAST
WEEK.
. &gt;&gt; WHO HAS BEEN DEALING WITH A
TRAUMA TO THE LEG FOR THE GREAT
CARE THEY HAVE GIVEN BOTH OFFICERS.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: DR. KING'S TWITTER
PAGE LISTS HIM AMONG OTHER THINGS AS A MARATHONER, IRON
MAN TRIATHLETE, SURGEON,
HARVARD PROFESSOR AND COMBAT VETERAN.
HE WAS DEPLOYED TO AFGHANISTAN
AND IRAQ AS A U.S. ARMY LIEUTENANT COLONEL AND COMBAT
SURGEON BEFORE HE STARTED
WORKING AT MASS GENERAL IN 2008.
AND SOME OF THAT TRAINING
HELPED TREAT MARATHON VICTIMS IN 20.
&gt;&gt;.
&gt;&gt; ALL OF OUR PATIENTS HAVE BENEFITED FROM THE LESSONS IN
THE PAST DECADE OF BATTLEFIELD
EXPERIENCE. &gt;&gt; Reporter: ONE OF THOSE
LESSONS WAS THE TOURNIQUET USED
ON THE BATTLEFIELD TO SAVE LIVES.
THE DOCTOR HAS INTRODUCED IT TO
A PROGRAM THAT INCLUDES TEACHERS, SCHOOL NURSES AND A
GROUP OF BOSTON POLICE OFFICER
THAT TOOK HIS CLASS A WEEK BEFORE THE EAST BOSTON
SHOOTING.
THEY CREDIT THAT TRAINING WITH KEEPING THEIR BROTHER OFFICERS
ALIVE UNTIL THEY GOT TO MGH
&gt;&gt; THE OFFICER WHO ACTUALLY APPLIED IT CAME OFF OF TRAINING
THIS PAST THURSDAY.
YOU TALK ABOUT A COINCIDENCE REALLY PAYING OFF FOR US.

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; A MINNESOTA WOMAN WILL
SPEND FOUR DAYS IN JAIL FOR
HITTING AND KILLING AN ELDERLY MAN WHILE TEXTING AND DRIVING.
THE ACCIDENT HAPPENED LAST
OCTOBER. THE VICTIM WAS A SCHOOL BUS
DRIVER WALKING OUT TO HIS
MAILBOX AT HOME WHEN HE WAS HIT.
THE DRIVE WILL SPEND TWO DAYS
TO JAIL IN THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE VICTIM'S DEATH AND TWO DAYS
ON THE ANNIVERSARY NEXT YEAR.
THE VICTIM'S FAMILY IS NOT ANGRY ABOUT THE SENTENCE.
&gt;&gt; FOUR DAYS OR 400 DAYS,  IT
REALLY DOESN'T MATTER. I KNOW SHE DIDN'T MEAN TO KILL
ANYONE.
&gt;&gt; THE FAMILY IS WORKING WITH LAWMAKERS TO LOBBY FOR STRICTER
AND MORE DEFINED DISTRACTING

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; METEOROLOGIST SHIRI SPEAR
JOINING US NOW.
YOU WERE RIGHT YESTERDAY, STARTED A LITTLE CLOUDY AND
OVERCAST.
&gt;&gt; Daniel:  BEFORE WE GET TO SHIRI SOME INTERESTING
STATISTICS.
STATISTICS WHEN IT COMES TO WEATHER WAS BROKEIN.
THE WARMEST SEPTEMBER ON
RECORD. NASA'S GODDARD INSTITUTE SAY
LAST MONTH'S TEMPERATURES MEAN
2016 IS ON TRACK TO BE THE HOTTEST YEAR ON RECORD.
ACCORDING TO THEIR FIGURES 11
OF THE LAST 12 MONTHS SET NEW RECORDS FOR THE HIGHEST
TEMPERATURES.
AND SHIRI JOINS US WITH THE FORECAST.
I MEAN, YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO
KEEP TRACK OF ALL OF THIS STUFF, SO I AM SURE THEY ARE
WATCHING OCTOBER TOO.
&gt;&gt; Shiri:  WATCHING OCTOBER AND THE ONLY RECORD GETTING UP TO
IS PROBABLY UP TO PROVIDENCE,
RHODE ISLAND. THE REST OF THE A AREA I DON'T
THINK WE WILL GET INTO THE LOW
TO MID-80s EVERYWHERE TODAY. DO HAVE THE SLIGHT RISK OF
SHOWERS OUT THERE AS THE FRONT
DROPS SOUTHWARD TODAY. MOST OF THOSE SHOWERS WILL BE
NORTH OF BOSTON JUST A CUP OF
SPOT SPRINKLES. BOSTON ITSELF A 20% RISK OF AND
AN SHOWER.NOT THAT HIGH BUT NOT
ZERO. I WILL HAVE MY HIGH CONTINUE TO
PRETTY CLOSE.
HERE IS THE FRONT DRAPED ACROSS CENTRAL NEW HAMPSHIRE AND INTO
MAINE AND VERMONT AND DROPPING
INTO THE AREA. IT DOESN'T ALWAYS BRING IN
COOLER AIR, AND IN THIS CASE,
IT IS NOT GOING TO BE A COOLER DAY THAN YESTERDAY.
TEMPERATURES WILL BE WARMER IF
NOT COMPARABLE SOUTH OF BOSTON WHERE IT DID WARM INTO THE 80s
AND DID BECOME LESS MUGGY AS WE
GO. 6 A.M. SNAPSHOT.
TEMPERATURES IN THE 60s.
PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES. AND WE DO HAVE ONE OR TWO
SPRINKLES UP INTO SOUTHERN NEW
HAMPSHIRE. SAGGING SOUTHWARD AND
APPROACHING BOSTON AROUND 8
A.M. I THINK THE RAIN HERE IS A
LITTLE OVERDONE.
STILL YOU GET THE HINT OF WHERE IT IS POSSIBLE, AND THEN AS WE
GET INTO LATE MORNING AND
LUNCHTIME, WE WILL BE WATCHING WHERE WE HAVE SOME OF THE
THICKER CLOUDS OVER
SOUTHEASTERN MASSACHUSETTS. AND OVERALL, MOST OF US WILL BE
DRY, TURNING MOSTLY CLOUDY FOR
A TIME TODAY WITH TEMPERATURES AT NOONTIME IN THE MID- TO
UPPER 70s.
AND THEN WE CLEAR OUT FROM NORTH TO SOUTH.
A LITTLE BIT OF STRUGGLE WITH
THE CLOUDS FROM SOUTHEASTERN MASSACHUSETTS, AND IT IS NOT
GOING TO BE QUITE AS MILD AIR
AND WE GET POPS OF 80s. PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND ONE OF
MY WARMER STOPS.
WORCESTER AND NORTHWARD. AFTERNOON HIGH TEMPERATURE, 78
IN BOSTON AND IPSWICH.
81 IN NORWOOD. 8 IN PRELIMINARY MOUTH.
79 IN FRAMINGHAM.
WON'T TAKE MUCH. 73 IN WORCESTER AND 76 IN
MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE.
LOW TEMPERATURES TONIGHT WILL BE BACK INTO THE 40s AND THE
50s.
TONIGHT IT KIND OF QUIET NIGHT. IT IS GOING TO BE A LITTLE
CLEARER WHICH MEANS WE DO SEE
TEMPERATURES TAKING A LITTLE BIT OF A HIT HERE.
WE ARE WAKING UP TO COOLER
TEMPERATURES AND COOLER TEMPS IN THE AFTERNOON.
AFTERNOON HIGHS LOW TO MID-60s
WHICH IS NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF THE YEAR.
IT WILL BE ABOUT 10 DEGREES
COOLER THAN WHAT WE ARE GETTING OUT OF THE FORECAST.
FEELING LIKE A DIFFERENT SEASON
TOMORROW. WE START TOMORROW CLEAR AND IN
COME THE CLOUDS AT 5 P.M. MOST
OF US WILL STILL DRY AND A SYSTEM THAT IS WORKING ITS WAY
TOWARD US AND THAT WILL BOIL
DOWN INTO SCATTERED LATE-DAY SHOWERS ON THURSDAY.
THIS 110 TOM, AS YOU ARE GOING
TO BED YOU GET A LITTLE MORE ACTION OUT THERE AND FOR FRIDAY
MORNING.
NOT TOTAL WASHOUT BUT THE RISK OF SOME SHOWERS.
I SEE THE AFTERNOON BECOMING
WETTER AND WE WILL HAVE TO WATCH HOW THIS SYSTEM THAT IS
COMING UP FROM THE TROPICS
INTERACTS WITH THIS -- THIS COLD FRONT IN THIS AREA LOW
PRESSURE BECAUSE WE DO HAVE THE
OPPORTUNITY HERE FOR SOME HEAVY RAIN WORKING ITS WAY IN.
RAIN THAT WE KNOW WE CAN USE.
THE SEVEN-DAY FORECAST WITH THE WEEKEND FALLS VIEW.
TEMPERATURES CLOSE TO 80
DEGREES, PARTLY SUNNY, 64 TOMORROW WHICH DEVELOPS RAIN.
RAIN ON YOUR FRIDAY AT OVER 70
DEGREES AND ON THE WEEKEND DRY OUT ON SATURDAY TURNING BREEZY
AT 60.
COOLING DOWN ON SUNDAY AT ONLY 56 DEGREES.
BACK OVER TO YOU, GUYS.
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, SHIRI.</description>

      <description>IS GROWING UP.
&gt;&gt;&gt; A HIT-AND-RUN DRIVER NEARLY
RUNS OVER A LITTLE GIRL AND AS MARK OCKERBLOOM REPORTS, THE
CRASH KILLED THE FAMILY DOG AND
LEFT THE OTHER FAMILY PET WEARING A NECK BRACE.
&gt;&gt; IT WOULD HAVE MADE A BIG
DIFFERENCE. &gt;&gt; Reporter: HAS BEEN KEEPING
THIS PAW PRINT IMPRESSION CLOSE
BY, ALL SHE HAS LEFT OF BELLA, HER YOUNG ROW DEESH SHAN
RIDGEBACK.
23:30 IN NASHUA, A DRIVER HIT HER TWO DOGS AND TOOK OFF.
&gt;&gt; I WAS LOOKING TO SEE THE CAR
ON THE STREET YELLING AND SCREAMING AT THE DRIVER.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: BELLA AND DEACON A
5-YEAR-OLD WAS ON A LEASH HELD BY THE 8-YEAR-OLD NIECE JUST
ABOUT TO CROSS THE STREET.
&gt;&gt; MY NIECE WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO TAKE ONE STEP BACK BUT NOT
ENOUGH TIME TO PULL THE DOGS
BACK. &gt;&gt; Reporter: THE DRIVER OF A
LIGHT BLUE SUV DIDN'T STOP AND
BLEW RIGHT THROUGH THIS STOP SIGN.
&gt;&gt; MY ROW DEESH SHAN BELLA GOT
THE WORST PART OF IT. &gt;&gt; Reporter: SHE DIED ON THE
WAY TO THE VET.
&gt;&gt; DEACON SUFFERED A FRACTURED PELVIS.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: NOW SHE IS SADDLED
WITH ADDS 5,000 VET BILL TO REPAIR DEKE  'S INJURIES.
NOW NOW HE IS CONFINE TO THIS
STROLLER. THERE IS NO WAY THE DRIVER
DIDN'T NOTICE BUT THANKFUL THAT
HER NIECE STEPPED BACK. &gt;&gt; WHAT HAPPENED IF SHE WAS HIT
TOO?
HOW WOULD THIS PERSON FEEL? &gt;&gt; Reporter: THE FAMILY IS
HOPING THE DRIVER COME FORWARD.
IN STATE LAW IT IS A VIOLATION NOT TO.
McCARTHY'S CONSIDER, THE MOTHER
OF THAT YOUNG GIRL SAID HER DAUGHTER IS SHAKEN AND THEY ARE
ALL LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY. &gt;&gt; THAT IS THE RIGHT THING TO
DO.
NOT JUST LET OUR FAMILY SUFFER. &gt;&gt; Daniel:  THAT WAS MARK
OCKERBLOOM REPORTING.
THE FAMILY HAS A GO FUND ME PAGE.

&gt;&gt; Gene:  THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US ON THIS WEDNESDAY,
OCTOBER 19.
HOPE YOUR MORNING IS YOU OFF TO A GREAT START.

WEATHER CENTER WITH HOW THE CLOUDS COULD IMPACT OUR
WARM-UP.

FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE, AND THE
QUICKER THOSE CLOUDS CLEAR UP THIS AFTERNOON THE WARMER YOUR
THURSDAY ARE GOING TO BE.
66 IN BOSTON RIGHT NOW. ALSO IN LAWRENCE AND NORWOOD.
MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES THERE.
YOU START GETTING INTO THE CLOUDS AS YOU GET INTO NORTHERN
MASS AND SOUTHERN NEW
HAMPSHIRE. STILL DRY.
THOSE SHOWERS AMOUNTING TO A
CUP OF SPOT PROPOSALS. HOUR-BY-HOUR FORECAST IN BOSTON
WILL INVOLVE INCREASING CLOUDS
HERE THIS MORNING. TURNING PARTLY CLOUDY AT 7 A.M.
AT 67 DEGREES BY 9 A.M., 69
DEGREES. WE MIGHT DEAL WITH A LITTLE
SPRINKLE IN BOSTON AROUND 8
OFFER 9 A.M. I GOT US IN THE UPPER 70s THIS
AFTERNOON WITH THAT INCREASING
SUNSHINE, BUT SOME OF US WILL GET UP TO 80 DEGREES.
I WILL BREAK DOWN THOSE HOT
SPOTS COMING UP. JULIE GRAUERT IS BACK WITH LIVE
DRIVE TIME TRAFFIC AND A CHECK

      <description>&gt;&gt; OUCH, THAT HURTS.
&gt;&gt; LITTLE PUNK.
THE GUY WHO OWNS THIS CAR SAW THIS 15 YEAR OLD IN THE GYM
NEARBY, GETS LOTS OF ATTENTION,
ACCORDING TO REPORTS THE KID'S MOM SAW THE VIDEO, DRAGGED THE
KID BACK DOWN THERE TO
APOLOGIZE. &gt;&gt; THAT IS SO TERRIBLE.
PLAY IT AGAIN.
&gt;&gt; IMAGINE YOU ARE ON AN UNINHABITED ISLAND.
&gt;&gt; SOUNDS NICE.
&gt;&gt; AND THE ONLY TOOL YOU HAVE IS YOUR CELL PHONE AND CELL SIGNAL.
&gt;&gt; OH, MY GOSH.
CHRISTIAN'S DREAM. &gt;&gt; THAT SOUNDS LIKE PARADISE.
&gt;&gt; MACK HERE HAS BEEN DROPPED
OFF ON BRUNETTE ISLAND IN CANADA WITH NOTHING MORE THAN A FEW
THINGS HERE AND THERE, MOSTLY TO
MAKE SURE HE HAS JUICE FOR HIS CELL PHONE AND CELL SIGNAL. HEY,
CRYSTAL, WELCOME TO THE STREAM.
I'M HERE AND I'M LIVE. &gt;&gt; HERE'S THE THING, THIS IS ALL
BEING BROADCAST LIVE THROUGH
FACEBOOK. THIS VIDEO STREAMING HERE OF DAY
ONE OF THE BROADCAST IS HIM
BEING DROPPED OFF. GETTING ON TO A LITTLE DINGY AND
PEOPLE ARE TUNING IN, CHECKING
IN WITH MACK. &gt;&gt; HEY, RACHEL, I'M ON THE
ISLAND AND I'M STREAMING.
I'M LIVE. IT WORKS!
I'M THE ONLY PERSON ON THIS
WHOLE ISLAND. &gt;&gt; IS WILSON WITH HIM?
&gt;&gt; HE DOESN'T HAVE WILSON, BUT
HE HAS THIS. &gt;&gt; TOM HANKS HAS WILSON, WHAT'S
THE NAME OF THE CARIBOU REINDEER
ON FROZEN? SID.
THIS IS SID, HE'S MY FRIEND.
&gt;&gt; AND THEY FIGURED OUT A WAY TO MAKE SURE HE HAS SOME KIND OF
SIGNAL.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S THE STREAMING, THAT'S THE ANTENNA.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S IT, NO FOOD, NO WATER,
NO TOOLS. &gt;&gt; HARD FOR YOU TO SEE, BUT
THAT'S A BLUEBERRY.
OH, LOOK, A WATERFALL. THERE'S MY FRESH WATER.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS COOL, BUT IRRITATING.
I LIVE IN THE MIDDLE OF A MAJOR METROPOLITAN CITY AND I CAN'T
GET SIGNAL.
HE'S IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN FOLLOW HIS ADVENTURES
ON HIS FACEBOOK PAGE.
&gt;&gt; HERE'S A BERRY I'M NOT SURE ABOUT.
IT'S THIS LITTLE PURPLE BERRY.
&gt;&gt; HE CAN ASK QUESTIONS, HE CAN ASK FOR ADVICE.
&gt;&gt; HOW PREPARED IS HE?
&gt;&gt; WHY DON'T WE ASK HIM? HE'S JOINING US VIA SKYPE "RIGHT
THIS MINUTE" ALL THE WAY FROM
HIS DESERTED ISLAND. WELCOME TO THE SHOW, MACK.
SO HOW PREPARED ARE YOU?
&gt;&gt; WELL, I'VE GROWN UP HUNTING AND FISHING AND CANOEING AND WATCHED YOUTUBE VIDEOS BEFORE I
LEFT.
PROBABLY HELPED A LITTLE BIT. &gt;&gt; WHAT'S YOUR GOAL OF THIS
WHOLE EXPERIMENT?
&gt;&gt; SO, THE IDEA IS NEXT YEAR WE COME BACK WITH A LIVE 24/7 TRUE
SURVIVAL EXPERIENCE, THE
SURVIVOR, THE CASTAWAY, DOESN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE
EQUIPMENT, JUST HAS TO WORRY
ABOUT SURVIVING. CAN TAKE THE AUDIENCE WITH HIM
ON THE JOURNEY.
THIS IS AN EQUIPMENT TEST. DOES ANYBODY CARE I'M ON THIS
ISLAND, WHICH APPARENTLY SOME
PEOPLE DO. KIND OF A SURPRISE TO ALL OF US.
&gt;&gt; HOW LONG DO YOU ANTICIPATE
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO STAY OUT THERE?
&gt;&gt; THAT KIND OF DEPENDS ON HOW
MUCH I CAN SUPPLEMENT MY RATIONS, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO BE
HOME FOR MY DAUGHTER'S FIRST
HALLOWEEN. &gt;&gt; GOOD LUCK, HAVE FUN, AND STAY
SAFE OUT THERE.
&gt;&gt; I WILL, APPRECIATE YOU GUYS. &gt;&gt; WATCHING IN EL PASO, TEXAS,
IS THE LATEST WINNER IN THE
"RTM" iPAD MINI GIVEAWAY. YOU CAN WIN, TOO, YOU NEED THE
BUZZ WORD, BE AT LEAST 21 YEARS
OLD, AND A RESIDENT OF OF THE U.S. OR CANADA.
&gt;&gt; "RTM" BUZZ WORD COMING UP IN
A BIT.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt; STAND BY, EVERYONE, FOR THE
"RTM" iPAD MINI GIVEAWAY.
&gt;&gt;&gt; WHEN I THINK ABOUT SOCCER, I THINK ABOUT SOCCER HOOLIGANS.
IN THE 89th MINUTE OF A THIRD
DIVISION MATCH, WHICH ISN'T GOING THE WAY OF SOME FANS
HOPED.
THEY DECIDED THE BEST WAY TO EVEN OUT THE SCORE IS
COMMUNICATE ON THEIR FACE.
HOWEVER, THESE TWO DOZEN FIGHTERS ARE FACING OFF AGAINST
THREE MEN.
THESE THREE MEN UNDERCOVER POLICE OFFICER.
THEY WERE PUT IN THE CROWD AS
SPOTTERS TO KEEP AN EYE OUT AS TROUBLEMAKERS.
&gt;&gt; ARE THEY IDENTIFYING
THEMSELVES AS COPS OR NO? &gt;&gt; YOU MAY NOTICE IN THE RIGHT
HANDS THEY HAVE EXTENDABLE
BATONS, SO IF THEY HAVEN'T LITERALLY IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES
AS SUCH, THE BATONS ARE DOING IT
FOR THEM. ONE BY ONE, A BUNCH OF ANIMALS,
YOU CAN SEE IT AS THESE THREE
OFFICERS ARE DOING THEIR BEST TO HOLD THEM BACK, BEING PUSHED
FURTHER AND FURTHER.
AS THEY LOOK THEY ARE FINALLY GOING TO BE BROKEN, THESE THREE
OFFICERS DECIDE TO TURN THE
TIDE. THEY FINALLY START LASHING OUT
WITH THEIR BATONS.
EVERY TIME ONE GETS CLOSE, BAM! &gt;&gt; THIS IS LIKE GANDOLF, SHALL
NOT PASS.
&gt;&gt; FAVORITE PART OF THE VIDEO IS RIGHT AT THE END.
APPARENTLY THE ENTIRE GROUP OF
50 TROUBLE MAKERS WERE ROUNDED UP AND SENT BACK TO THE
NETHERLANDS.
THE HOOLIGAN-LIKE BEHAVIOR CONTINUED INTO RUSSIA.
THIS OLDER COUPLE GETTING INTO A
VERBAL ALTERCATION WITH THIS YOUNGER COUPLE.
IN PARTICULAR, THE GIRL RIGHT
HERE WITH THE PURPLE HAIR. WHAT'S LOOK LIKE IT'S ALSO
CALMED DOWN, THE CAMERA PANS OUT
AND WE SEE THE LADY PICKS UP A PIECE OF WOOD AND STARTS
SWINGING IT AT THE LADY.
&gt;&gt; NO! &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HIT AN OLD LADY
LIKE THAT.
&gt;&gt; THE GUY PUTS HIMSELF BETWEEN THE TWO LADY, TAKES ONE HIT
HIMSELF, AS SHE CONTINUES TRYING
TO SWING. EVENTUALLY, EVERYONE GOES THEIR
OWN WAY.
LET'S JUST SAY EVERYBODY CHILL,</description>

      <description>LEVEL THREE SEX OFFENDER SPENT
TIME IN PRISON FOR CRIMES
AGAINST CHILDREN IS BACK IN COURT DAYS AFTER HIS RELEASE.
&gt;&gt; Julie: POLICE SAY EARLIER
THIS MONTH THE MAN ENTERED A PUBLIC LIBRARY ILLEGALLY AND
THAT'S WHAT EVENTUALLY LED TO
THE ARREST. CATHERINE PARROTTA LIVE IN
BOSTON AND, CATHERINE, COURT
APPEARANCE EXPECTED TO START SHORTLY.
&gt;&gt; Catherine: IT IS DISCUSSION
WHAT COURT WOULD BE IN AND TURNS OUT THE COURT APPEARANCE IS
GOING TO BE MOVING BACK TO
ROXBURY AND HEAD THERE VERY SHORTLY TO BE ABLE TO BE THERE
WHEN THAT PROBATION VIOLATION
HEARING BEGINS. BUT AGAIN, THIS COMES JUST A
COUPLE WEEKS AFTER THIS MAN WAS
RELEASED FROM PRISON AND RESIDENTS IN ONE LOCAL
NEIGHBORHOOD FOUGHT TO GET HIM
OFF OF THEIR STREETS. &gt;&gt; HOPEFULLY THIS NEVER HAPPENS
AGAIN AND THIS IS A WAKE-UP CALL
TO JUST BE STRICTER ON REPEAT SEXUALLY DANGEROUS PERSON.
&gt;&gt; Catherine: RICHARD GARDNER
ARRESTED AT ROXBURY HOMELESS SHELTER FRIDAY ON FUGITIVE FROM
JUSTICE WARRANT OUT OF
RHODE ISLAND AND SUMMONED TO COURT FOR VIOLATION OF QUINCY
SEX OFFENDER ORDINANCE THAT
HAPPENED EARLIER THIS MONTH. ACCORDING TO QUINCY POLICE
REPORT INVESTIGATORS SAY GARDNER
WAS SEEN AT THE LIBRARY IN QUINCY WITHOUT WRITTEN
PERMISSION AND LIBRARIAN THOUGHT
SHE SAW HIM LOOKING AT PIX OF -- PICTURES OF CHILD WITHOUT A
SHIRT BUT THEN HE WAS LOOKING AT
E-MAILS LATER. HE WAS MOVING INTO HIS MOTHER'S
HOME IN WEYMOUTH.
&gt;&gt; COMMUNITY CAN SLEEP A LITTLE BIT BETTER KNOWING HE IS NOT ON
THE STREETS.
&gt;&gt; Catherine: GARDNER SENTENCED TO SERVE 190 YEARS IN
PRISON FOR KIDNAPPING AND SEXUAL
ABUSING CHILDREN AND WON SHORTER SENTENCE ON APPEAL.
HILL WAS AMONG THOSE TO HAVE
GARDNER REMOVED FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND ALSO WORKING
WITH LOCAL LAWMAKERS ON TOUGHER
LEGISLATION ON SEX OFFENDER PRISON SENTENCES AND PAROLE
CONDITIONS.
SOMETHING SHE HOPES WILL PUT THE MINDS OF THE COMMUNITY IN EASE.
&gt;&gt; I FEEL LIKE IT IS THE ONLY
OPTION. &gt;&gt; Catherine: LOCAL LAWMAKER
WANTS LAWS ON BOOKS AND ALSO
WANT TRACKING DEVICE THAT'S REQUIRED ONCE THEY COME OUT.
SOMETHING NOT REQUIRED IN
GARDNER'S CASE AND HE IS GOING TO HAVE PROBATION VIOLATION
HEARING TODAY AT THE COURTHOUSE
IN ROXBURY AND KEEP YOU POSTED. LIVE HERE IN SOUTH BOSTON,
CATHERINE PARROTTA, FOX25 NEWS.
&gt;&gt; Heather: THIS IS NEW THIS MORNING, FOX25 WORKING TO GET
MORE INFORMATION ABOUT A
SHOOTING INVESTIGATION OVERNIGHT IN LAWRENCE.
YOU COULD SEE THROUGH THIS VIDEO
POLICE COMBING HAVERHILL STREET FOR EVIDENCE LATE LAST NIGHT.
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY CONFIRMING
TO FOX25 THE MAN WAS FLOWN TO BOSTON HOSPITAL WITH A GUNSHOT
WOUND.
RIGHT NOW WE ARE WORKING TO GET UPDATE ON THAT MAN'S CONDITION.
&gt;&gt; Heather: RHODE ISLAND MAN
IN COURT TODAY ACCUSED OF STABBING THREE MEN NEAR PLYMOUTH
STATE UNIVERSITY IN
NEW HAMPSHIRE. THIS HAPPENED EARLY YESTERDAY
MORNING.
19-YEAR-OLD TERENCE SIMMONS JUNIOR WAS ARRESTED HOURS LATER.
ONE OF THEM IS HOSPITALIZED IN
STABLE CONDITION RIGHT NOW AND TWO OF THE VICTIMS ARE PSU
STUDENTS.
SIMMONS NOT A STUDENT AT THE SCHOOL.
&gt;&gt; Julie: TWO-YEAR-OLD GIRL IS
LATEST VICTIM OF GUN VIOLENCE IN ROXBURY.
THE TODDLER WAS SITTING IN CAR
SEAT SATURDAY WHEN SHE WAS STRUCK BY TWO BULLETS INTENDED
FOR HER FATHER.
LUCKILY SHE IS GOING TO BE OKAY BUT AS FOX25 STEPHANIE
COUEIGNOUX SHOWS US THE DRIVE-BY
SHOOTING GROWING STRONG REACTION FROM THE GIRL'S GRANDMOTHER AND
THE CITY'S MAYOR.
&gt;&gt; Stephanie: MAYOR MARTY WALSH CALLING THIS DEEPLY
TROUBLING AND NEW THIS MORNING
THE LITTLE GIRL'S GRANDMOTHER IS SPEAKING OUT TELLING THE BOSTON
GLOBE THAT PEOPLE NEED TO COME
FORWARD WITH VITAL INFORMATION. OTHERWISE THIS VIOLENCE JUST
WON'T END.
HOWEVER, POLICE HAVEN'T ARRESTED ANYONE IN CONNECTION TO
SATURDAY'S SHOOTING AND THEY SAY
ONE REASON IS THAT WITNESSES SIMPLY AREN'T COOPERATED
INCLUDING THE TWO-YEAR-OLD'S
FATHER. THE SHOOTER WAS ACTUALLY AIMING
FOR THE GIRL'S FATHER WHO THEY
SAY IS WELL-KNOWN GANG MEMBER. SHOOTER MISSED AND ENDED UP
HITTING GIRL IN THE HAND AND
LEG. SHE IS EXPECTED TO BE OKAY AND
THE GRANDMOTHER SAYS SHE IS AN
ABSOLUTE TROOPER BUT THIS SHOOTING COMES JUST ABOUT A WEEK
AFTER NINE-YEAR-OLD GIRL WAS
SHOT ALSO IN ROXBURY AND POLICE SAY THERE THE GIRL WAS ALSO AN
INNOCENT BYSTANDER.
NO ARRESTS HAVE BEEN MADE IN THAT CASE EITHER.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; THIS PARTICULAR CASE HERE, FATHER NOT WILLING TO STEP UP.
I THINK THAT QUESTIONS HIS
CHARACTER AND JUDGMENT IN LIFE. WHICH IS VERY DISAPPOINTING.
&gt;&gt; Stephanie: MAYOR WALSH SAYS
MOST PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS WORKING TO CREATE A SAFER
COMMUNITY AND ON THE PART OF
POLICE THEY SAY THAT THEY ARE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH
NEIGHBORS TO MAKE SURE THAT
EVERYONE STAYS SAFE. NOW, I HAVE REACHED OUT TO
POLICE ON BOTH THESE
INVESTIGATIONS AS SOON AS I HEAR BACK I WILL LET YOU NOY.
OUTSIDE BOSTON POLICE
HEADQUARTERS, I'M STEPHANIE COUEIGNOUX, FOX25 NEWS.
&gt;&gt; Julie: SEE THE PRU LIT UP
BLUE IN HONOR OF POLICE OFFICERS SHOT AND THERE WILL BE A MASS
FOR ALL BOSTON OFFICERS.
MATT MORRIS AND RICHARD CINTOLO CONTINUES TO RECOVER.
BOTH MEN ARE IN CRITICAL BUT
STABLE CONDITION. COMMISSIONER BILL EVANS SAY THEY
ARE TALKING AND ALERT.
&gt;&gt; Heather: TODAY LAWYERS FOR BILL COSBY WILL BE IN COURT
RELATED TO THE DEFAMATION
LAWSUIT AGAINST COSBY. SEVEN WOMEN SAY THE COMEDIAN
RUINED THE NAMES BY ACCUSING
THEM OF MAKING UP STORIES OF ASSAULT.
NOW COSBY'S LAWYERS WANT TO
ACCESS -- WANT ACCESS TO COUNSELING RECORDS FOR ONE OF
THE WOMEN INVOLVED.
JUDGE WILL NEED TO DECIDE WHETHER COSBY'S TEAM HAD ACCESS
TO MEDICAL RECORDS AS WELL.
COSBY'S LAWYERS ALSO WANT THE DEFENSE TO TURN OVER STATEMENTS
FROM DOZEN POTENTIAL WITNESSES.
&gt;&gt; Julie: TOM BRADY TALKING ABOUT RELATIONSHIP WITH DONALD
TRUMP ABOUT THE TRIUMPHANT
RETURN TO GILLETTE STADIUM. FANS GOING WILD AS BRADY TOOK
THE FIELD IN FAUX FOR -- FOXBORH
FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS SEASON. HE WAS ON A-GAME PUT NEW ENGLAND
IN FRONT TEN-SEVEN AT BREAK.
BRADY AND GRONK UNSTOPPABLE. CAREER HIGH AND PATS TOOK HOME
THE WIN AND BRADY'S RETURN ISN'T
AT ONLY THING THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT AND THIS MORNING HE SPOKE
WITH WEEI KIRK AND CALLAHAN
ABOUT REFUSAL TO TALK ABOUT DONALD TRUMP LAST WEEK.
&gt;&gt; OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF HEADLINES
TO MAKE AND SO FORTH, SO -- TRIED NEVER TO MAKE A LOT OF
HEADLINES.
&gt;&gt; Julie: HE MET TRUMP YEARS AGO AND HE WILL DISCUSS WHO HE
VOTED FOR DURING THE ELECTION.
CURRENT BREAST CANCER PATIENTS ALSO INVITED TO THE GAME SPECIAL
GUEST OWNER BOB KRAFT.
DOZEN LADIES GOT THE INVITE LAST WEEK WHILE THEY TOOK PART IN
SECOND ANNUAL DAY OF PAMPERING.
ON THURSDAY THEY WERE TREATED TO BREAKFAST, MANICURES MANICURES T
AND GREET WITH GRONK AND TOM
BRADY AND HITS HOME FOR BRADY A FEW WEEKS AGO AND THEY REVEALED
SOMEONE IN THE FAMILY IS
BATTLING THE DISEASE. &gt;&gt; Julie: WE TRACK TRAFFIC AND
WEATHER TOGETHER EVERY TEN
MINUTES. RIGHT NOW ON 93 SOUTH STILL
PRETTY SLOW OUT THERE, 51, 50
MINUTE MARK 495 IN ANDOVER TO THE ZAKIM BRIDGE.
SHIRI?
&gt;&gt; Shiri: I HAVE TEMPERATURES RIGHT NOW IN THE 60s ALONG
WITH MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES HEADED
MOMENT FROM WORK LATER TODAY. PLAN ON THE 70s.
I HAVE ALSO GOT A FEW SHOWERS
EXPECTED ON FUTURE CAST. I WILL GIVE YOU THE TIMELINE IN
LESS THAN TEN.
&gt;&gt; Heather: ONE WOMAN SPENDING BIG BIRTHDAY GIVING BACK TO
OTHERS.
COMING UP HOW SHE WAS ABLE TO FEED THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE FOR A
FEW HUNDRED DOLLARS.
THIS POLITICAL SEASON FEW THINGS LEFT THAT MAY SURPRISE VOTERS.
THERE ARE STILL SURPRISES OUT
THERE.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt; Julie: APP FOR CUSTOMERS
CALLED IDENTITY CHECK MOBILE FOR
CUSTOMERS AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK IN CAMERA PHONE AND
BLINK.
THE BLINKING PREVENTS SOMEONE FROM JUST USING A PICTURE OF
YOUR FACE.
TESLA PUSHING BACK AND SURPRISE ANNOUNCEMENT UNTIL WEDNESDAY.
CEO ORIGINALLY HINTED UNEXPECTED
PRODUCT WILL BE REVEALED TODAY. THE DELAY HASN'T STOPPED RUMORS
FROM FLYING AND MANY SPECULATING
WHAT THE ANNOUNCEMENT WILL BE AND WONDERING IF THERE WILL BE A
NEW CAR AND IMPROVEMENT TO NEXT
MODEL. &gt;&gt; Julie: HOW DO YOU PLAN TO
SPEND THE NEXT BIRTHDAY AND
SPECIAL GOAL FOR CELEBRATION. WARN WANTS TO FEED 30,000 PEOPLE
BY HER THIRTIETH BIRTHDAY.
WHAT AN AMAZING GOAL. SO SHE HAS BEEN FEEDING NEEDY
FOR YEARS AND IT IS COUPONING
THAT MAKES IT ALL POSSIBLE. &gt;&gt; I WAS ABLE TO GET BOTH ITEMS
FOR FREE AND GOING TO COUPON
LIKE CRAZY FOR THE MEATBALLS. I THINK PROBABLY CLOSE TO 50
BOXES DOWN IN HERE.
&gt;&gt; Heather: NEIGHBORS HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY SUPPORTIVE AND
NICE TO HEAR AND HOPING TO CUT
ON THE HUNGER ONE SNIP AT THE TIME.
MAKING BIG DENT THERE.
&gt;&gt; Julie: OFFICER TREATED TO SURPRISE SHOW.
CAN'T HELP BUT ROCK BACK AND
FORTH AND DANCING TO SONG MY GIRL AND ASKED THE OFFICER IF

THEM IN THE AIR. GATHERED AT NEW HAMPSHIRE MOTOR
SPEEDWAY IN LOUDON AND
CELEBRATING WEEKEND LONG EXTREME CONTEST AND CLAIMS THE GROUP
BROKE A WORLD RECORD WITH LAUNCH

SOARING THROUGH THE AIR AND THIS YEAR EXTREME CONTEST MARKED THE
EVENT SECOND YEAR.

DAMAGE INSIDE NEW BEDFORD -- NEWBURY STREET BROWNSTONE AND
SMOKE POURING FROM THE BUILDING
YESTERDAY AND HARD TO SEE BUT THERE ACTUALLY IS MAN SITTING ON
SECOND FLOOR SEEMINGLY UNAWARE
THERE'S A FIRE BELOW HIM. PEOPLE ON THE STREET SPENT
MINUTES YESTERDAY TRYING TO GET
THE MAN'S ATTENTION ANY WAY THEY COULD.
&gt;&gt; STARTED THROWING STONES TO
GET HIS ATTENTION AND EVERYONE WAS ACTUALLY YELLING AT THAT
POINT TO GET OUT BECAUSE SMOKE
JUST GOT -- IT WAS INCREASEING. &gt;&gt; Gene: MOMENTS BEFORE
BYSTANDER RUN IN AND ABLE TO
SHUT OFF THE GAS AND PREVENTED EXPLOSION.
&gt;&gt; Sara: 40,000 STATE
EMPLOYEES BUYOUT. MICHAEL HENRICH LIVE AT THE
STATEHOUSE THIS MORNING AND,
MICHAEL, IF THIS DOESN'T CLOSE THE BUDGET DEFICIT THEN LAYOFFS
COULD BE COMING.
&gt;&gt; Michael: HOPING VOLUNTARY BUYOUT PROGRAM WILL DO THE TRICK
BUT RIGHT NOW IT IS A BIG BUDGET
SHORTFALL, CLOSE TO $300 MILLION.
GOVERNOR BAKER'S PLAN TO CLOSE
294 MILLION-DOLLAR BUDGET STARTS WITH BUYOUTS OFFERED TO 42,000
STATE EMPLOYEES.
&gt;&gt; WHILE THIS WILL CERTAINLY BE AS IT ALWAYS IS, DIFFICULT
EXERCISE, PEOPLE SHOULD REMEMBER
BASICALLY REPRESENTS 1% OF EXECUTIVE BRANCH SPENDING.
&gt;&gt; Michael: IF NOT ENOUGH
STATE EMPLOYEES TAKE THE BUYOUT OPTION THERE COULD BE LAYOFFS.
STATE OFFICIAL SAY LOWER TAX
REVENUES CAUSE THAT BUDGET SHORTFALL.
THAT SAID, GOVERNOR BAKER
INSISTS THE, QUOTE, STUFF THAT MATTERS MOST TO PEOPLE WON'T BE
IMPACTED.
&gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT GOING TO TOUCH LOCAL AID TO CITIES AND TOWNS,
TOUCH HIGHER ED AND COURTS AND
DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES AND NOT GOING TO TOUCH
THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH.
&gt;&gt; Michael: SEM KNELTIC TO THE VOLUNTARY BUYOUT PROGRAM AND
STATE AGENCIES OPERATING
DANGEROUSLY LOW STAFFING LEVEL, BARE BONES AS PUT IT AND UPDATE
YOU AS SOON AS WE HEARD BACK.
MEANTIME THE COMMONWEALTH DOES OFFER BUYOUTS TODAY.
LIVE AT STATEHOUSE, I'M MICHAEL
HENRICH, FOX25 NEWS. &gt;&gt; Gene: RECORD SNOWFALL LEFT
THOUSANDS STRANDED AND NOW
LEARNING GET OUT OF PAYING SOME OF THEM.
THIS MORNING APPROACH "T" HAS
CONFIRMED WAVED SOME OF THE FINES FOR KEOLIS DUE TO CLAUSE
FOR UNFORESEEABLE CIRCUMSTANCES.
PASSENGERS TOLD FOX25 THEY DON'T COMPLETELY BLAME KEOLIS FOR THE
2015 PROBLEMS SAYING IT WAS
AMOUNT OF SNOW THAT CAUSED SO MANY DELAYS.
GOVERNOR BAKER ALSO DEFENDED THE
DECISION TO WAVE SOME OF THE FINES SAYING KEOLIS DID END UP
PAYING MORE THAN $6 MILLION IN
PENALTIES. &gt;&gt; Gene: DURING TONIGHT'S
MEETING MASS DOT WILL EXPLAIN
HOW THE TOLLS WORK AND THE CONSTRUCTION PLAN TO REMOVE THE
CURRENT BOOTHS.
MEETING HAPPENING AT EAST BOSTON HIGH SCHOOL.
THE TOLL SWITCHOVER WILL TAKE
EFFECT A WEEK FROM FRIDAY. &gt;&gt; Sara: IT IS NOW SAFE TO
EAST HARVEST SHELLFISH AND STILL
BANNED ON THE CAPE. RHODE ISLAND'S BAN HAS LIFTED
MORE THAN A WEEK AFTER THEY
FOUND HARMFUL ALLERGY. WATER TESTED THIS WEEKEND SHOWED
IT WAS GOOD FOR FISHING FISHINGD
EATING ONCE AGAIN. MASSACHUSETTS OFFICIALS RECALLED
SHELLFISH HARVESTED IN PARTS OF
THE CAPE AFTER DOZENS OF PEOPLE THAT ATE IT GOT SICK.
MEANT THAT ANNUAL WELLFLEET
OYSTER FEST HAD TO DO OVER THE WEEKEND.
&gt;&gt; MOVED INLAND TO PREVENT
DAMAGE AND LIGHT COULD MEAN MORE THAN MILLION DOLLARS IN REPAIRS.
WHITE HOUSE ADVISORY BOARD WILL
MEET TOMORROW TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PAY FOR THE RESTORATIONS.

FIRST STEP WILL FIX STRUCTURAL AND SAFETY ISSUES AND COST
AROUND $300,000.
&gt;&gt; Gene: FRAMINGHAM COUPLE HAS REASON TO SMILE THIS MORNING

ALLSTON-BRIGHTON TOLLS NEAR THE PIKE YESTERDAY.
ACCORDING TO POLICE MOM AND BABY

TRAFFIC BEFORE BUT THIS IS AN
ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SORT OF DEAL. &gt;&gt; Julie: ONE UPPED ALL OF US.
I KNOW TRAFFIC IS BAD BUT
DOESN'T LEAD TO PEOPLE HAVING CHILD OVER IT.
128 SOUTHBOUND IN WOBURN,
WOULDN'T SAY IT IS SO SLOW YOU REALLY NEED TO HAVE A BABY BUT A

&gt;&gt; Sara: FOUR MOTHERS OVERDOSE ON HEROIN WHILE HOSTING A

      <description>&gt;&gt; Heather: ANOTHER REMINDER
HOW PERVASIVE THE OPIOID
EPIDEMIC RIGHT NOW AND 12-YEAR-OLD GIRL WENT DOWNSTAIRS
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND
STUMBLED ON FOUR WOMEN THAT WERE UNRESPONSIVE.
THE 12-YEAR-OLD CALLED 911.
&gt;&gt; ALPHA. HAPPENING MORE AND MORE
EVERYDAY.
PRETEENS AND TEENS UPSTAIRS BEDROOM AT SPRINGFIELD HOME
WHILE THE WOMEN WENT OUT TO
PURCHASE DRUGS CAME HOME AND ODED.
SPRINGFIELD POLICE TELL ME THE
MOTHERS THOUGHT THEY WERE SNORTING COCAINE BUT THE DRUGS
FIELD TESTED POSITIVE FOR
HEROIN. WHEN EMERGENCY CREWS ARRIVED TWO
OF THE WOMEN HAD PULSES BUT TWO
DID NOT. ALL FOUR GIVEN OPIOID REVERSAL
DRUG NARCAN AND QUICKLY BECAME
ALERT AND ABLE TO WALK IN AMBULANCES.
&gt;&gt; HOW MANY CASES HAVE BEEN WHEN
PARENTS PASSED OUT AND KIDS ARE SITTING BEHIND THEM.
&gt;&gt; NEIGHBORS NEVER EXPECT
ANYTHING LIKE THIS. &gt;&gt; NOT FOR EVERYBODY.
SOMETIME PROBABLY NOTHING ABOUT
IT. &gt;&gt; Heather: THEY WILL TEST THE
PURITY OF HEROIN TO SEE IF IT
MIGHT BE MIXED WITH ANOTHER DRUG.
DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN AND
FAMILIES HAS NOW BEEN NOTIFIED. SPRINGFIELD POLICE CAPTAIN TELLS
ME THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT OF
THE DEPARTMENT IS NOW INVESTIGATING.
LIVE IN THE STUDIO, I'M HEATHER
HEGEDUS, FOX25 NEWS. &gt;&gt; Gene: HEALTHCARE WORKERS
AND POLICE BRACING FOR DEADLY
TREND IN THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC. ELEPHANT TRANQUILIZER 10,000
STRONGER THAN MORPHINE.
IT IS NOT IN MASSACHUSETTS YET BUT ALREADY GETTING TRAINING ON
HOW TO HANDLE IT AND POLICE
URGED TO NOT FIELD TEST THE DRUGS SO THAT THEY DON'T COME IN
CONTACT WITH THEM.
INSTEAD, OFFICERS ARE SUPPOSED TO SECURE THE DRUG AND TURN IT
OVER TO THE LAB.
PRESCRIPTION RULED TO HELP CRACKDOWN ON OPIOID EPIDEMIC NOW
IN EFFECT.
BEFORE DOCTORS DESCRIBE OPIOID THE WEBSITE SEE WHAT OTHER
PRESCRIPTIONS THE PATIENTS HAVE
FILLED. THE STATE SPENT $6 MILLION TO
MAKE IT MORE USER FRIENDLY AND
FOR THE FIRST TIME DOCTORS CAN NOW SEE PRESCRIPTIONS FILLED OUT
OF STATE.
&gt;&gt; Julie: WE TRACK TRAFFIC AND WEATHER TOGETHER EVERY TEN
MINUTES.
SLOWING DOWN ON 128 SOUTHBOUND RIGHT AFTER YOU PASS ROUTE 3 IN
THE BURLINGTON AREA AND WORK
YOUR WAY SOUTHBOUND THROUGH LEXINGTON.
93 SOUTH STILL STEADY HEAVY
VOLUME IN MEDFORD AND COULD NOTUING INTO SOMERVILLE AND ROCK
AROUND 109 AND HEAD NORTHBOUND
UP TO ROUTE 9 AND JUST THIS SPOT IN GENERAL ON 128 FIND ALWAYS
SLOW DOWN IN ACCIDENT OR STALL
OR CRASH AND LIVE LOOK AT EXPRESSWAY WHERE THINGS COULD BE
WORSE AND ACTUALLY MOVING ALONG
AT DECENT PACE ON THE EXPRESSWAY RIGHT NOW.
29 MINUTE RIDE FROM THE INTRANET
PILOT TO THE EXIT FOR THE PIKE AND HOUR AND TEN MINUTES ON 93
SOUTH FROM 495 TO THE LEVERETT
CONNECTOR. 35 MINUTES ON 128 NORTHBOUND IN
THAT SEGMENT I POINTED OUT AS
YOU HEAD FROM WESTWOOD UP TO THE WESTON TOLLS.
BACK TO YOU.
&gt;&gt; Shiri: BUMP ONCE IN AWHILE OUT THERE, NOT THE KIND OF BUTCH
HAVE YOU OPENING UP AGAIN.
&gt;&gt; Gene: KEEP THE WINDOWS OPEN.
GOING TO BE ATTEMPTING AND
SOMEONE WILL WANT TO TURN THE ON AC AGAIN.
&gt;&gt; Shiri: SHUT WINDOWS AND
TRANSITION INTO NEXT WEEK IT WILL BE GET COLDER AGAIN AND 15Â°
WARMER IN BOSTON THAN YESTERDAY
AND HEY, BOSTON, HOW DO YOU LIKE THE 64, I KNOW WE ARE LOOKING
NICE AND BRIGHT OUT THERE.
WE HAVE ALSO GOT DEW POINT TEMPERATURES SNEAKING AND UP
HIGHER THE NUMBER THE MORE
MOISTURE WE HAVE IN THE AIR. WE GET THE NUMBER CLOSE TO 60Â°.
IT STARTS FEELING PRETTY HUMID
OUTSIDE AND WE DO HAVE THE ELEMENT OF HUMIDITY THAT WE BE
DEALING WITH THE NEXT COUPLE
DAYS. BOSTON 67Â° HERE AT 10:00 A.M.
NOON TIME 70s, HANG OUT IN THE
MID-70s FOR MOST OF THE AFTERNOON AND PROBABLY GOING TO
FALL BACK INTO THE SIXTIES HERE
DURING THE EVENING COMMUTE AND WHAT YOU WILL FIND WE START OUT
NICE AND BRIGHT ONCE WE HIT THE
AFTERNOON AND CLOUDS DO SLOWLIY START TO ROLL BACK IN AND IT IS
BECAUSE WE HAVE A FRONT NEARBY
AND IT IS GOING TO TRIGGER NOT JUST THE CLOUD COVER BUT
POTENTIALLY A COUPLE SPOT
SHOWERS HERE. AND PLANS OUTSIDE, PACK
UMBRELLA, HAVE A FEELING MOST OF
YOU WON'T NEED IT BY 9:00 P.M. AND SEE WE HAVE REALLY LIMITED
COVERAGE FROM THOSE SHOWERS AND
EVEN OVERNIGHT TONIGHT MOSTLY DRY CONTINUES TO BE THE THEME.
WE GOT 73 IN BOSTON, 75 IN
LAWRENCE TODAY, 76 IN FOXBOROUGH, 72 IN WORCESTER.
THESE TEMPERATURES GOOD TENÂ°
ABOVE AVERAGE TONIGHT. YOU'RE GOING TO FIND MORE 50s
AND 60s SO WHEN YOU WAKE UP
TOMORROW MORNING TO THESE TEMPERATURES IT IS A LOT LIKE
TODAY, IT IS GOING TO BE A WARM
ONE, IT IS GOING TO BE A WARMER ONE, IN FACT, AS WE GET
TEMPERATURES POPPING INTO THE
80s HERE IN NORWOOD, FRAMINGHAM, LAWRENCE, UP TO
MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE, UPPER
70s ALONG THE COASTLINE, SO TONIGHT BECAUSE WE GOT THE FRONT
STILL KIND OF NEARBY AT
MIDNIGHT, THAT'S WHY I'M GOING TO HOLD THE CHANCE FOR OVERNIGHT
SHOWER AND BY THE TIME YOU WAKE
UP TOMORROW MOANING, PARTLY -- , PARTLY CLOUDY HUMIDITY AND STAY
ON THE WARM SIDE OF THIS WHOLE
SYSTEM AS WE TRAVEL TOWARD THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK BY FRIDAY.
THAT'S THE FRONT THAT'S
EVENTUALLY GOING TO BRING IN RAIN AND CAUSE COOLDOWN OVER THE
WEEKEND.
7-DAY FORECAST WITH WEEKEND ALWAYS IN VIEW HAS PARTLY CLOUDY
SKIES, 80s TUESDAY WEDNESDAY,
BY THURSDAY 68Â° LATE SHOWER RISK FRIDAY.
I HAVE RAIN AROUND AT 70Â° AND WE
ARE GOING TO SINK THROUGH THE SIXTIES HERE OVER THE WEEKEND AS
WE VERY SLOWLY CLEAR OUT.
BACK OVER TO YOU. &gt;&gt; STRONG PASSWORD CAN KEEP THE
COMPUTER SAFE BUT ALL IT SAKES
FOR SOMEONE TO STEAL THE LOG-IN INFORMATION IS APP AND $50.
&gt;&gt; IT WILL BE A BIG PROBLEM.
WRONG HAND THIS IS DAYCARE -- DANGEROUS AND ALL THE MONEY AND
FINANCES CAN BE LIQUIDATED.

ABLE TO PULL DRIVER AWAY FROM
THE FLAMES AND MAN FOUGHT BACK AGAINST THE HELP AND TAKEN TO
THE HOSPITAL AND CONDITION STILL
UNKNOWN. SCARY BOAT CRASH CAUGHT ON
CAMERA.
THE BOAT WAS CARRYING A FATHER AND TWO SONS WHEN OVERTURNED OFF
THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA.
SURFERS JUMPED INTO ACTION AND HELPING THE TWO BOYS BACK TO
SHORE.
&gt;&gt; WE WERE ON SHORE. &gt;&gt; Sara: NO ONE WAS
HURT.
&gt;&gt; Gene: STOPPING DRESSING AS CLOWNS TO SCARE PEOPLE.
HERO HAS EMERGED AND PROMISING
KIDS HE WILL CLEAN UP THE STREETS.
&gt;&gt; KIDS THAT HAVE BEEN SCARED
AND AFFECTED BY THE CLOWNS. NO NEED TO WORRY ANY MORE.
BATMAN IS TAKING CARE OF IT.
WANT TO SCARE SOMEONE, WHY YOU SCARE ME.
&gt;&gt; Gene: MANY CHILDREN WERE
SCARED BY CLOWN SIGHTINGS AND BATMAN CHASING CLOWNS OUT OF
NEIGHBORHOOD AND VISITING A
SCARED LITTLE BOY. NOT ALL HEROES.
SOME HAVE TRUNKS.
PARTICULAR LOOK AT VIDEO FROM THAILAND.
PRETTY REMARKABLE.
SAVE THE ELEPHANT FOUNDATION WAS IN RIVER WHEN CURRENT PICKED UP.
SEE STARTS TO SPLASH AROUND.
COULD SEE AFTER HE DOES THAT YOUNG ELEPHANT SWAM INTO THE
WATER TO SAVE HIM AND MAN WASN'T
ACTUALLY IN DANGER. BUT HE WAS ABLE TO SWIM TO THE
EDGE WITH THE ELEPHANT BY HIS
SIDE. THAT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.
&gt;&gt; Sara: THAT IS REALLY COOL.
&gt;&gt; Gene: EVER RIDE AN ELEPHANT STANDARD PRACTICE WHEN CIRCUS
COMES TO TOWN.

ACCIDENT ON 128 NORTH AT 24 HAS
CLEARED. THIS ACCIDENT ON ROUTE 3
NORTHBOUND RIGHT AT THE
EXPRESSWAY IS IN THE CLEARING STAGES.
WE ARE JUST ABOUT TO SEE IT
TOWED OFF IN OUR PICTURES I HAVE BEEN WATCHING FROM SKY FOX.
WE HAVE A NEW ACCIDENT ON 93
SOUTH BEFORE CAMBRIDGE STREET, THAT'S CONTRIBUTING TO LONGER
DRIVE TIMES ON 93 SOUTH.
RIGHT NOW 38 MINUTES ON ROUTE 1 FROM 128 TO THE TOBIN.
AN HOUR AND TEN MINUTES ON 93
SOUTH AS YOU APPROACH THE LEVERETT CONNECTOR, HOUR ON 128
SOUTHBOUND FROM ROUTE 1 IN
PEABODY TO THE WESTON TOLLS. BACK TO YOU.
&gt;&gt; Gene: MAN THAT WAS
SENTENCED TO 190 YEARS IN PRISON FOR KIDNAPPING AND RAPING BOYS
IS BACK BEHIND BOYS.
HE WAS RELEASED ON APPEAL AFTER SERVING 30 YEARS.
&gt;&gt; Sara: ORIGINALLY NEIGHBORS
IN WEYMOUTH WERE OUTRAGED TO THE PARENTS HOME AND LIVE IN SOUTH
BOSTON WHERE HE WILL FACE CHARGE
OF VIOLATING THE PAROLE. CATHERINE?
&gt;&gt; Catherine: HE WILL APPEAR
HERE AT COURTHOUSE IN SOUTH BOSTON FOR THAT PROBATION
VIOLATION HEARING TODAY.
THIS, OF COURSE, COMING AS HE WAS JUST RELEASED FROM PRISON A
FEW WEEKS AGO, A LITTLE BIT
EARLIER THIS MONTH AND NEIGHBORS IN ONE LOCALHEY
FOUGHT TO GET THEM OFF THE
STREETS THERE. HOPEFULLY THIS NEVER HAPPENS
AGAIN AND WAKE-UP CALL TO JUST
BE STRICTER, REPEAT SEXUALLY DANGEROUS PERSON.
&gt;&gt; Catherine: AMANDA HILL
TALKING ABOUT RICHARD GARDNER. HE WAS ARRESTED ARRESTED ON
FUGITIVE AFTER QUINCY SEX
OFFENDER ORDINANCE THAT HAPPENED EARLIER THIS MONTH AND GARDNER
SEEN AT THE LIBRARY WITHOUT
WRITTEN PERMISSION WHICH IS REQUIRED FOR SEX OFFENDERS AND
LIBRARIAN THOUGHT SHE SAW HIM
TAKING PICTURE OF CHILD AND ONLY SAW HIM LOOKING AT E-MAIL WHEN
LOOKED AGAIN.
HE WAS MOVING INTO HIS MOTHER'S HOME IN WEYMOUTH.
&gt;&gt; SHOULD NEVER BEEN RELEASED IN
THE FIRST TIME AND COMMUNITIES CAN SLEEP BETTER.
&gt;&gt; Catherine: SERVING 190
YEARS IN PRISON FOR KIDNAPPING AND SEXUALLY ABUSING CHILDREN
AND WON SHORTER SENTENCE ON
APPEAL. HILL WAS AMONG THOSE THAT
STARTED PETITION TO HAVE GARDNER
REMOVED FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND WORKING WITH LAWMAKERS ON
PAROLE CONDITIONS, SOMETHING SHE
HOPES WILL PUT THE MINDS OF THOSE IN THE COMMUNITY AT EASE.
&gt;&gt; I HAVE LIKE THIS IS THE ONLY
OPTION. &gt;&gt; ONE LAWMAKER DOES BELIEVE
THERE SHOULD BE TOUGHER
RESTRICTIONS FOR SEX OFFENDER. I WILL EXPLAIN THAT COMING UP
APPROXIMATE, CATHERINE PARROTTA,
FOX 25 NEWS. &gt;&gt; Sara: NEW THIS MORNING FOX
25 WORKING TO GET MORE
INFORMATION ABOUT SHOOTING INVESTIGATION IN LAWRENCE.
YOU COULD SEE POLICE COMBING
HAVERHILL STREET FOR EVIDENCE LATE LAST NIGHT.
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY CONFIRMS
FOX25 THAT MAN WAS FLOWN TO BOSTON WITH A GUNSHOT WOUND.
WE ARE WORKING TO GET AN UPDATE
ON HIS CONDITION. &gt;&gt; NEXT THING YOU KNOW IT RANG
OUT, IT WAS CONSISTENT.
BANG, BANG, BANG. &gt;&gt; Gene: NEIGHBORS CALLING FOR
CHANGE IN ROXBURY.
FOUR SHOOTINGS IN LESS THAN TWO WEEKS, THIS TIME TWO-YEAR-OLD
GIRL WAS HIT IN THE HAND AND LEG
WHILE SITTING IN BACK SEAT OF THE CAR.
POLICE SAY THE GIRL IS EXPECTED
TO BE FINE AND THEY BELIEVE HER FATHER WAS THE INTENDED TARGET.
FOX25 STEPHANIE COUEIGNOUX IS IN
ROXBURY THIS MORNING WHERE POLICE SAY THE FATHER HAS GANG
CONNECTIONS AND IS NOT
COOPERATING. &gt;&gt; Stephanie: LITTLE GIRL'S
GRANDMOTHER SPEAKING OUT TELLING
THE BOSTON GLOBE THEY NEED TO COME FORWARD WITH VITAL
INFORMATION, OTHERWISE THE
VIOLENCE JUST WON'T END. HOW FAR, POLICE HAVEN'T ARRESTED
ANYONE IN CONNECTION TO
SATURDAY'S SHOOTING AND THEY SAY ONE REASON IS THAT WITNESSES
SIMPLY AREN'T COOPERATING,
INCLUDING THE TWO-YEAR-OLD'S FATHER.
POLICE SAY THE SHOOTER WAS
ACTUALLY AIMING FOR THE GIRL'S FATHER WHO THEY SAY IS
WELL-KNOWN GANG MEMBERS.
THE SHOOTER MISSED AND ENDED UP HITTING THE GIRL IN THE HAND AND
THE LEG.
NOW, SHE IS EXPECTED TO BE OKAY AND THE GRANDMOTHER SAYS SHE IS
ABSOLUTE TROOPER.
BUT THIS SHOOTING COMES JUST ABOUT A WEEK AFTER NINE-YEAR-OLD
GIRL WAS SHOT, ALSO IN ROXBURY,
AND POLICE SAY THERE THE GIRL WAS ALSO AN INNOCENT BYSTANDERS.
NO ARREST HAVE BEEN MADE IN THAT
CASE EITHER. &gt;&gt; CASE A WEEK BEFORE WAS AWFUL.
THIS PARTICULAR CASE HERE,
FATHER NOT WILLING TO STEP UP. THAT QUESTIONS HIS CHARACTER AND
JUDGMENT IN LIFE.
SO WHICH IS VERY DISAPPOINTING. &gt;&gt; Stephanie: PART OF POLICE
THEY SAY THAT THEY ARE
CONTINUING TO WORK WITH NEIGHBORS TO MAKE SURE THAT
EVERYONE STAYS SAFE.
NOW, I HAVE REACHED OUT TO POLICE ON BOTH THESE
INVESTIGATIONS AS SOON AS I HEAR
BACK I WILL LET YOU NOY. OUTSIDE BOSTON POLICE
HEADQUARTERS, I'M STEPHANIE
COUEIGNOUX, FOX25 NEWS. &gt;&gt; Gene: TWO BOSTON POLICE

COSBY'S LAWYERS ALSO WANT DID
THE FENCE TO TURN OVER STATEMENTS TO DOZEN POTENTIAL
WITNESSES.
&gt;&gt; Gene: TOM BRADY TALKING ABOUT RELATIONSHIP WITH DONALD

ONLY THING TALKING ABOUT AND
KIRK AND CALLAHAN ABOUT HIS REFUSAL TO COMMENT ON DONALD

KNOW, HEADLINES TO MAKE, AND I
TRIED NEVER TO MAKE A LOT OF HEADLINES.
&gt;&gt; Gene: HE MET TRUMP 15 YEARS
OLD AND HE WILL DISCUSS WHO HE VOTED FOR AFTER THE ELECTION.
&gt;&gt; Sara: OCTOBER IS BREAST

&gt;&gt; GOOD MORNING, EVERYBODY. 8:16, WE TRACK TRAFFIC AND
WEATHER TOGETHER EVERY TEN
MINUTES. I'M SEEING THINGS SLOW DOWN ON
128 NORTHBOUND.

LOSING TWO AND A HALF MINUTES OF
DAYLIGHT AND TODAY ON THE NOSE, BOSTON SUNRISE 7:00.
SUN SETS BEFORE 6:00 P.M. AT
5:58 AND WE ARE LOSING SIGNIFICANT DAYLIGHT EACH DAY.
NORMAL HIGH TEMPERATURE 61Â° AND
WE STARTED WARMER THAN THAT THIS MORNING, SO IF THE STARTING
POINT HIGH TEMPERATURES ARE, YOU
KNOW IT IS GOING TO BE A REALLY WARM DAY HERE.
64 ALREADY IN BOSTON, 58Â° IN
LAWRENCE, 54 IN NORWOOD, WE ARE GOING TO TAKE THINGS OUT TO
PLYMOUTH, TEMPERATURE THERE ARE
GOING TO BE WORKING THEIR WAY INTO THE 70s BY LUNCHTIME.
SO I GOT PLYMOUTH AT 74Â°, I GOT
BOSTON AT 73, MID-70s UP TO BEVERLY, 76 BEDFORD.
HOW ABOUT THAT 77 IN NORWOOD
WHICH I KNOW IS GETTING CLOSE TO 80Â°.
TOMORROW WE HAVE A BETTER CHANCE
OF ACTUALLY MAKING IT TO 80Â°. AFTER NICE BRIGHT START TO THE
DAY, FRONT THAT'S PRETTY CLOSE
BY THIS AFTERNOON. I ANTICIPATE THAT'S GOING TO
DRAW IN SOME EXTRA AFTERNOON
CLOUDS. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLY GOING TO
TRIGGER JUST A COUPLE ISOLATED
SHOWERS. TALKING KIND OF LONELY SHOWERS
OUT THERE.
I WOULD SAY MOST OF YOU STAI DRY BUT WE HAVE THE RISK STARTING
AROUND THE EVENING COMMUTE OUT
TOWARD CENTRAL MASS, SOUTHERN NEW HAMPSHIRE, MERRIMACK VALLEY

MORNING -- THE EVENING COMMUTE HERE.
METEOROLOGIST JASON BREWER
BREAKING THEM DOWN AND OVERNIGHT TONIGHT FRONT STILL NEARBY FOR A
LITTLE SHOWER BUT BY THE TIME
YOU WAKE UP TOMORROW MORNING THE FRONT WILL BE LIFTING NORTHWARD.
THAT'S REALLY GOING TO PULL IN
THE HEAT, THE HUMIDITY FOR THE DAY TOMORROW AND IT WILL GET
BRIGHTER AS THE DAY GOES ON FOR
TUESDAY. TUESDAY'S HIGHS WELCOME BACK TO
THE 80s, MY FRIENDS, A LITTLE
BIT BREEZY AND GUSTS FROM THE SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST AT 20,
25 MILES PER HOUR, SO IT IS HOT,
GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT BREEZY HERE ON TUESDAY.
WEDNESDAY ANOTHER 80 DEGREE DAY,
INCREASE CLOUDS, 68 AND CHANCE THURSDAY ON SHOWERS BEST BET FOR
RAIN WILL ACTUALLYOB FRIDAY AND
WE SHOULD DRY OUT WITH SIXTIES OVER THE WEEKEND.
BACK OVER TO YOU.
&gt;&gt; Sara: NIGHT SKY MAY HAVE SEEMED BRIGHTER THIS WEEKEND
BECAUSE THE SUPER MOON TOOK TURN

UBER AND MASTERCARD USING A SELFIE IN PLACE OF A PIN AND FOR

      <description>TO THE ELECTRON.
BACK TO YOU.
&gt;&gt; Gene: HAPPENING TODAY LEVEL THREE AND ENDSPENT DECADES FOR
CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN, IS BACK
IN COURT. &gt;&gt; Sara: THE MAN ENTERED A
PUBLIC LIBRARY ILLEGALLY AND NOW
GETTING A BETTER IDEA WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN DOING THERE.
FOX25 CATHERINE PARROTTA HAS A
LOOK AT THE NEW ALLEGATIONS. GOOD LUCK THIS CONVICTED HELL
THREE SEX OFFENDER WILL BE IN
COURT FOR PROBATION VIOLATION HEARING.
HE WAS JUST RELEASED FROM PRISON
A LITTLE EARLIER THIS MONTH. MEANTIME NEIGHBORS IN ONE LOCAL
COMMUNITY WERE FIGHTING TO GET
HIM OFF OF THEIR STREET. &gt;&gt; HOPEFULLY THIS NEVER HAPPENS
AGAIN AND THIS IS A WAKE-UP CALL
TO JUST BE STRICTER ON REPEAT SEXUALLY DANGEROUS PERSON.
&gt;&gt; Catherine: AMANDA HILL
TALKING ABOUT RICHARD GARDNER, CONVICTED SEX OFFENDER.
HE WAS ARRESTED ON FUGITIVE FROM
WARRANT OUT OF RHODE ISLAND OUT A QUINCY SEX OFFENDER ORDINANCE
HAPPENED EARLIER THIS MONTH.
GARDNER SEEN AT THE LIBRARY IN QUINCY WITHOUT WRITTEN
PERMISSION WHICH IS REQUIRED FOR
SEX OFFENDERS. WE HAVE ALSO LEARN THE LIBRARIAN
TOLD POLICE SHE SHOT SHE THOUGHT
HIM LOOKING AT CHILD WITHOUT A SHIRT BUT ONLY SAW THE E-MAIL
WHEN SHE LOOKED AGAIN.
THE ARREST COMES AFTER GARDNER WAS RELEASED FROM PRISONER
EARLIER THIS MONTH MOVING INTO
HIS MOTHER'S HOME IN WAITING. &gt;&gt; SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN
RELEASED IN THE FIRST PLACE, SO
THE COMMUNITY CAN SLEEP A LITTLE BETTER KNOWING THAT HE IS NOT ON
THE STREETS.
&gt;&gt; Catherine: 1989 SERVING 190 YEARS IN PRISON FOR KIDNAPPING
AND SEXUAL ABUSING PRISON AND
WON SHORTER SENTENCE ON APPEAL AND HILL WAS ONE OF THOSE TO
REMOVE HIM FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD
AND WORKING WITH LOCAL LAWMAKERS ON TOUGHER LEGISLATION ON SEX
OFFENDER PRISON SENTENCES AND
POREAL CONDITIONS. SOMETHING SHE HOPES WILL PUT THE
MINDS OF THOSE IN THE COMMUNITY
AT EASE. &gt;&gt; I FEEL LIKE THIS IS THE ONLY
OPTION.
&gt;&gt; ONE LOCAL LAWMAKER DOES WANTED TO SEE SOME OTHER
RESTRICTIONS IN PLACE FOR LEVEL
THREE SEX OFFENDERS LIKE GARDNER AND EXPLAIN MORE NEXT HALF HOUR.
CATHERINE PARROTTA, FOX25 NEWS.
&gt;&gt; Gene: NEW THIS MORNING FOX25 IS WORKING TO GET MORE
INFORMATION ABOUT A SHOOTING
INVESTIGATION IN LAWRENCE. YOU COULD SEE POLICE COMBING

THAT OFTENTIMES PEOPLE ARE TOO
AFRAID TO COME FORWARD. SO FAR POLICE HAVEN'T MADE ANY
ARREST IN SATURDAY AFTERNOON'S
SHOOTINGS. IS AND THEY SAY ONE REASON IS
BECAUSE WITNESSES AREN'T
COOPERATING, INCLUDING THE TWO-YEAR-OLD GIRL'S FATHER.
POLICE SAY THE SHOOTER WAS
ACTUALLY AIMING FOR THE GIRL'S FATHER AND THEY SAY IS A
WELL-KNOWN GANG MEMBER.
ENDED UP HITTING GIRL IN LEG AND HAND.

SHOOTING COMES AFTER A WEEK

AN INNOCENT BYSTANDER. NO ARREST IN THAT CASE EITHER.
&gt;&gt; NINE-YEAR-OLD GIRL THAT GOT
SHOT A WEEK BEFORE IS AWFUL. THIS PARTICULAR CASE HERE, THE
FATHER IS NOT WILLING TO STEP
UP. QUESTIONS IS CHARACTER AND
JUDGMENT IN LIFE WHICH IS VERY
DISAPPOINTING. &gt;&gt; Sara:

      <description>&gt;&gt; Sara: U.S. DEPARTMENT OF
TRANSPORTATION WORKING ON NEW
RULES TO REGULATE SERVICE ANIMALS ON AIRPLANES.
RIGHT NOW THERE ARE NO CLEAR
GUIDELINES HOW TO IDENTIFY A SERVICE ANIMAL.
PEOPLE ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE
PASSING OUT THEIR PATS TO SPECIALLY TRAINED HELPER.
IT IS A SAFETY CONCERN SINCE
THEY DON'T GET THE SAME IN DEPTH TRAINING AS SERVICE ANIMALS.
ONE WOMAN THAT RELIES ON SERVICE
DOG SAYS SHE CAN IMMEDIATELY TELL WHEN SOMEONE IS CHEATING.
&gt;&gt; DON'T INTERACT SO KIND OF
TELL THEY ARE GUILTY, KIND OF. I THINK THEY ARE MAKING IT MORE
DIFFICULT FOR LEGITIMATE SERVICE
DOGS. &gt;&gt; ANOTHER BIG ISSUE THE DOT IS
TACKLING IS WHETHER OR NOT THERE
SHOULD BE A RULE ABOUT WHAT KIND OF ANIMAL CAN BE CERTIFIED.
WE SHOWED YOU THIS VIDEO BACK IN
AUGUST, PERSON STROLLING THROUGH SECURITY WITH MONKEY.
THEY EXPECT TO HAVE THE NEW
RULES READY FOR PUBLIC COMMENT</description>

THESE SMARTPHONES TO CATCH FIRE.
SAMSUNG ESTIMATES IT HAS LOST MORE THAN $5 BILLION BECAUSE OF
THE BATTERY PROBLEM.
&gt;&gt; Gene: TWO MAJOR COMPANIES LOOKING INTO FUTURE OF PASSWORD
PROTECTION.
UBER USING A SELFIE IN PLACE OF A PIN.
SO UBER IT IS A SPECIAL APP
AVAILABLE ONLY TO DRIVERS AND APP CALLED IDENTITY CHECK MOBILE
FOR CUSTOMERS.
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AT PHONE CAMERA AND BLINK.
THE BLINKING PREVENTS SOMEONE
FROM USING PICTURE OF YOUR FACE. &gt;&gt; Gene: TESLA PUSHING BACK
SURPRISE ANNOUNCEMENT UNTIL
WEDNESDAY. CEO OF THE CAR COMPANY
ORIGINALLY HINTED ABOUT
UNEXPECTED PRODUCT THAT WOULD BE REVEALED TODAY.
THE DELAY NOT STOPPED RUMOR FROM
FLYING AND MANY SPECULATING WHAT THE ANNOUNCEMENT WILL BE,
WONDERING IF THERE WILL BE A NEW
CAR AND IMPROVEMENTS TO EXISTING MODEL.
&gt;&gt; Sara: HOUSE IN CONNECTICUT
IS SCARING THE INTERNET JUST IN TIME FOR HALLOWEEN.
MANY SAY THE HOME IN AVON,
CONNECTICUT LOOKS LIKE A HOUSE OF HORROR SAYING THE RED ON WALL
LOOKS LIKE BLOOD SPLATTER AND
HOUSE LOOKS LIKE A CRIME SCENE. CRITICS SAY THE WHOLE HOUSE IS
LIKE WALKING INTO A HAUNTED
PANCREAS AND NO SURPRISE. THE PRICE DEPRECIATED WITH THE
NEW DECOR.
2013 IT WAS LISTED $1.4 MILLION AND NOW IT IS GOING FOR JUST
$399,000.
&gt;&gt; Gene: NO THANKS. &gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK SO.
THERE ARE WACKY WALLPAPERS OUT

SNOW, I'M AGO FOR IT. &gt;&gt; Shiri: NOT THAT I'M GOING

&gt;&gt;&gt; AND HAPPENING TODAY,
THOUSANDS OF STATE WORKERS ARE GETTING THE OPTION OF A BUYOUT
TO LEAVE THEIR JOBS ALL IN THE
HOPES OF CLOSING A MULTIMILLION DOLLAR BUDGET DEFICIT.
FOX25'S HEN THEN LIVE AT THE
STATE HOUSE THIS MORNING WITH THE BIG -- MICHAEL HENRICH IS
LIVE AT THE STATEHOUSE THIS
MORNING WITH A BIG SAVINGS FOR TAXPAYERS.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: TAXPAYERS GAVE UP
THEIR TAX-FREE SHOPPING WEEKEND TO AVOID A BUDGET DEFICIT LIKE
THIS, BUT WE ARE TALKING A $300
MILLION SHORTFALL AND THE GOVERNOR HAS A PLAN THAT
INCLUDES BUYOUT OFFERS FOR TENS
OF THOUSANDS OF STATE EMPLOYEES.
&gt;&gt; I MEAN,  WE ARE GOING TO
MAKE SURE WE BALANCE THE BUDGET.
ER UNDER CONSTITUTIONAL
REQUIREMENT TO DO THAT, AND WE WILL.
AND WE HAVE SINCE WE TOOK
OFFICE. &gt;&gt; Reporter: GOVERNOR CHARLIE
BAKER'S PLAN TO CLOSE A
PROJECTED $294 MILLION BUDGET DEFICIT STARTS WITH BUYOUTS.
OFFERED TO ROUGHLY 42,000 STATE
EMPLOYEES. &gt;&gt; WHILE THIS WILL CERTAINLY BE
AS IT ALWAYS IS A DIFFICULT
EXERCISE, PEOPLE SHOULD REMEMBER BASICALLY REPRESENTS
1% OF SPENDING.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: IF NOT ENOUGH EMPLOYEES TAKE THE BUYOUT
OPTION THERE COULD BE LAYOFFS.
STATE OFFICIALS SAY LOWER TAX REVENUES CAUSED THAT SHORTFALL
WITH THAT SAID GOVERNOR BAKER
INSISTS THAT THE STUFF THAT MATTERS MOST TO PEOPLE WON'T BE
IMPACTED.
&gt;&gt; WE WON'T TOUCH LOCAL AID TO CITIES AND TOWNS.
NOT TOUCH K-12 FUNDING.
NOT TOUCH HIGHER ED. NOT TOUCH THE COURTS.
AND NOT THE DEPARTMENT OF
CHILDREN AND FAMILY. WE WILL NOT TOUCH THE
DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: A LEADER IN THE UNION REPRESENTING THOUSANDS OF
STATE WORKERS IS QUOTED BY "THE
GLOBE" AS BEING SYMPATHETIC TO THE VOLUNTARY PROGRAM BUT DID
CAUTION THAT STATE GOVERNMENT
IS ALREADY OPERATING AT A DANGEROUSLY LOW STAFFING LEVEL,
BARE BONES IS HOW THE UNION
LEADER PUT IT. I REACHED OUT DIRECTLY TO THE
UNION TO GET COMMENT TO FOX25.
MEANWHILE, THE COMMONWEALTH STARTS OFFERING THOSE BUYOUTS
TODAY.

RALEIGH.
EVERY ROAD IN THE TOWN IS OFF LIMITS, AND OFFICIALS SAY MOST
OF THE 2,000 RESIDENTS HAVE
EVACUATED. ONE EVACUEE SAYS IT IS HARD TO
EXPLAIN TO HER DAUGHTER WHY SHE
CAN'T GO TO SCHOOL. &gt;&gt; SHE GOES TO PRINCEVILLE
SCHOOL.
I TOLD HER THIS MORNING THAT PRINCEVILLE SCHOOL GOT FLOODED
HER REACTION ON HER FACE
TOTALLY BROKE MY HEART, BUT I COULDN'T BREAK DOWN IN FRONT OF
HER.
I STAYED STRONG FOR HER. &gt;&gt; Gene:  THERE ARE THREE OTHER
TOWNS STILL UNDER WATER.

      <description>A BREAK BEFORE REPAIRING THEIR
HOME AND STARTING A FAMILY.
&gt;&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, NOW 6:50 ON THIS MONDAY MORNING AND WE ARE
REALLY -- A NICE SUMMER-LIKE
TEMPERATURES AROUND HERE. &gt;&gt; Sara:  IT WILL BE GREAT ONE
MORNING EARLY IN THE MORNING I
HAD ON MY BIG LONG COMFY COAT. &gt;&gt; Shiri:  WENT OUT THE DOOR IN
THE AFTERNOON.
&gt;&gt; Sara:  IT WILL BE GONE. &gt;&gt; Shiri:  HEATHER HEGEDUS WORE
HER UGGS INTO WORK.
MAYBE SANDALS THE NEXT CONSULTANT OF DAYS.
MAN-D ALS GENE?
WHY NOT DO IT. TEMPERATURES THAT ARE
SIGNIFICANTLY WARMER THAN
YESTERDAY AT THIS TIME. TALKING 20 TO 30 DEGREES WARMER
IN NORWOOD.
16 DEGREES WARMER IN BOSTON AND SETHING UP THINGS THIS MORNING
BEGINNING IN THE UPPER 50s AND.
BOSTON, 63 DEGREES  A EARLY MORNING CLOUD COVER.
DEW POINT 57.
THE HIGHER THAT NUMBER THE MORE MOISTURE IN THE AIR STARTS
FEELING HUMID, RIGHT.
HUMIDITY WILL BE ON THE RISE EARLY THIS WEEK.
ALSO LENDING TO THAT FEEL OF
SUMMER IN THE AIR. 8 A.M. TEMPERATURE 63 DEGREES.
WE HAVE PATCHY CLOUDS.
THOSE ARE OUT. THE SUN IS IN LATE MORNING AND
INTO THE EARLY AFTERNOON.
AND BY LUNCHTIME 70 DEGREES IN BOSTON.
MID-70s LATER TODAY AND BY 4
P.M., 6 P.M. YOU CAN SEE TEMPERATURES SINKING BACK INTO
THE 60s THERE THE BRIGHT
MORNING FORECAST AND ONCE WE HIT THE AFTERNOON CLOUDS WILL
THICKEN UP.
BETWEEN 3 AND 4 WE START TO SEE POPS OF ISOLATED SHOWERS IN THE
CENTRAL MASS, THE MERRIMACK
VALLEY, SOUTHERN NEW HAMPSHIRE. I THINK THOSE ARE SPOTS TO
WATCH OUT FOR AND AN AFTERNOON
SHOWER AS WE GET CLOISTER TO THE EVENING AND THE EVENING
COMMUTE.
A CUP OF THOSE SHOWERS COULD GET CLOSE TO BOSTON OR THE MASS
PIKE.
KEEP IN MIND, THEY ARE SO WIDELY SCATTERED THAT THEY WILL
HAVE VERY LOW IMPACT ON ANY OF
YOUR TRAVEL PLANS LATER TODAY. MID-70s TODAY FOR THE DAY
AHEAD.
TOMORROW IT IS MORE LIKE 80s. TOMORROW IT IS GOING TO BE A
BRIGHT DAY.
I DON'T THINK THAT WE ARE QUITE GOING TO MAKE THE RECORD HIGHS
IN THE MIDDLE 80s FOR THE DAY
TOMORROW, BUT I CAN WEDNESDAY WITH RECORD HIGHS IN THE LOWER
80s.
ACTUALLY GOT THE SHOT OF MATCHING SOME OF THOSE RECORDS.
BY THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY.
BATCH OF SHOWERS ON FRIDAY. AND 60s OVER THE WEEKEND AND WE
SLOWLY CLEAR OUT THOSE CLOUDS.
GET YOU OVER TO JULIE GRAUERT WITH LIVE DRIVE TIME TRAFFIC.
JULIE, YOU HAVE AN EYE ON AN
ACCIDENT?  NATICK.
A LITTLE BIT OF A BACKUP
APPROACHING THAT AREA. IF IT GETS REALLY BAD WE WILL
SECOND OUT A PUSH ALERT SO IT
IS ON YOUR RADAR. FROM MEDFORD INTO SOMERVILLE.
ROUTE 1 IN SAUGUS SLOWER THAN
THE LAST TIME WE CHECKED IN. 49 MINUTES ON THE PIKE
EASTBOUND FROM 495 TO MASS
AVENUE. LIKE I MENTIONED, IF THAT DRIVE
TIME ALL OF A SUDDEN POPS UP
BECAUSE OF THAT ACCIDENT, WE WILL LET YOU KNOW.
33 MINUTES ON THE EXPRESSWAY.
42 MINUTES ON 128 SOUTHBOUND FROM ROUTE 1 IN PEABODY TO THE
WESTON TOLLS.
BACK TO YOU.</description>

NEW TREND IN THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC CALLED KERFENTANYL.
AN ELEPHANT TRANQUILIZER THAT
IS 20,000 TIMES STRONGER THAN MORPHINE.
THE DRUG ISN'T IN MASSACHUSETTS
YET, BUT THE STATE CRIME LAB IS GETTING TRAINING ON HOW TO
HANDLE IT AND POLICE ARE BEING
URGED NOT TO TEST THE DRUGS SO THEY DON'T COME IN CONTACT WITH
THEM.
INSTEAD OFFICERS ARE SUPPOSED TO SECURE THE DRUG AND TURN IT
OVER TO THE LAB.

      <description>OUT THE BATON.
&gt;&gt; HE'S NOT GOING TO TWIRL IT,
IS HE? &gt;&gt; DOESN'T GET A CHANCE TO USE
IT BECAUSE HE HEARS SOMETHING IN
THE BACKGROUND. &gt;&gt; WHAT'S THAT GUY GOT?
&gt;&gt; IS THAT A GUN?
&gt;&gt; STABBING THE CAR. &gt;&gt; SO VERY PROPER ABOUT IT.
&gt;&gt; PROPER GOES OUT THE WINDOW
RIGHT ABOUT HERE. THE GUY STABBING AT THE OTHER
CAR NOW TAKES HIS CAR AND RAMS
IT INTO THE PERSON HE'S ARGUING WITH.
&gt;&gt; OH!
&gt;&gt; NOT SURE WHAT CAUSED THE ROAD RAGE.
DOESN'T MATTER.
IT'S ALL OUT OF CONTROL. THE GUYS IN THE NEXT VIDEO NEEDS
TO TAKE A CHILL PILL, TOO.
HERE WE ARE AT A BUS STOP IN RUSSIA.
HAS HIS FOOT PROPPED UP ON THE
STEPS. LOOKS LIKE HE'S TALKING TO HIS
BUD BEHIND HIM.
DOOR CLOSES, FOOT IS STILL IN THERE.
AT THIS POINT HE'S BEATING ON
THE DOOR TO LET THE DRIVER KNOW WHEN HIS FRIEND ROLLS UP.
&gt;&gt; HOLY COW!
&gt;&gt; PULLS OUT A STRAP. HEY, STOP THE BUS!
&gt;&gt; SHOULDN'T OPEN THE DOOR.
&gt;&gt; TALK ABOUT OVERREACTING A LITTLE BIT.
&gt;&gt; YOU THINK?
&gt;&gt; YOU SEE ANOTHER GUY WALK UP, BACK UP, IT'S COOL, IT'S COOL.

WOBBLES. &gt;&gt; THEY ARE WEEBL WOBBLING ALL
RIGHT.
&gt;&gt; THIS TIME YOU CAN SEE THE DRIVER.
&gt;&gt; NICE CUBBY HOLE THERE.

PROOF.

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; ONE THING I'VE LEARNED
DURING MY TIME AT "RIGHT THIS
MINUTE" IS ELEPHANTS LOVE BATH TIME.
YOU SEE THREE OF THESE ELEPHANTS
IN THIS MANMADE POND HAVING A GOOD TIME, AT LEAST THEY WERE,
UNTIL THEY TRIED TO GET OUT.
THESE ELEPHANTS ARE STUCK AND IT BECAME QUITE THE ANIMAL RESCUE
TO GET THEM OUT, BECAUSE AS YOU
SEE HERE, THE HERD IS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR BUDDY.
&gt;&gt; DRINK THE WATER DOWN.
THEY WANT PEOPLE TO GET OUT. &gt;&gt; I WAS THINKING THE SAME
THING.
&gt;&gt; HUMAN RESCUERS WERE CALLED IN AND YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE THE
RESPONSE.
60 POLICEMEN WERE CALLED IN, BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THE
ELEPHANTS WERE AGITATED ABOUT
WHAT WAS GOING ON AND THE FRIENDS WERE IN DISTRESS, THEN
THEY BROUGHT IN A TRACTOR AND
HELICOPTER AND THERE YOU CAN SEE THEM STARTING TO DIG AROUND THIS
POND TO HELP GET THEM OUT.
SEE THAT? THAT ELEPHANT, HEY, COMING TO
GET ME, BUT THEY KNOCKED THE
WALL DOWN, WATER COMES OUT, AND THE ELEPHANTS ARE ABLE TO WALK
OUT TO SAFETY.
&gt;&gt; ANOTHER RESCUE, THIS IS IN THAILAND AT THE ELEPHANT NATURE
PARK, BUT THE ROLES ARE
REVERSED. RIGHT THERE IS DEREK, WE'VE SEEN
HIM ON THE SHOW BEFORE.
DEREK HAS A VERY COOL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ELEPHANT
RIGHT THERE.
HE THINKS DEREK IS DROWNING, IS IN TROUBLE, SO HE JUMPS INTO THE
WATER, GOES ON A RESCUE MISSION
TO SAVE THE HUMAN. &gt;&gt; ELEPHANT BAY WATCH.
âª I'LL BE THERE âª
âª I'LL BE THERE âª &gt;&gt; WATCH THIS, GETS CLOSE TO
DEREK.
PUTS THE TRUNK AROUND HIM. &gt;&gt; I WANT AN ELEPHANT BEST
FRIEND.
&gt;&gt; LOOK AT THIS, KIND OF PUTS HIM BETWEEN HER FRONT LEGS.
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT GOING NOWHERE.
&gt;&gt; THAT IS SO COOL, MAN. &gt;&gt; ISN'T THAT COOL?
PROTECTS HIM LIKE HER LITTLE
BABY. &gt;&gt; SO CUTE.
&gt;&gt; IT IS.
ROLES REVERSED.</description>

      <description>ADORABLE.
&gt;&gt;&gt; WE HAVE TWO VERY BEAUTIFUL
REUNION STORIES. THIS ONE IS SO INCREDIBLY
SPECIAL.
DAD COMES HOME AFTER A SEVEN-MONTH DEPLOYMENT TO SEE
HIS SON, 5-YEAR-OLD ETHAN, IN
THE HOSPITAL. AT THIS MOMENT WHEN DAD GETS
THERE, DAD CAN'T WAIT TO SAY
HELLO TO HIS SON, SO HE GENTLY STARTS WAKING HIM UP.
HE BARELY OPENS HIS EYES.
&gt;&gt; FIVE MORE MINUTES. &gt;&gt; ETHAN, LOOK WHO IT IS.
&gt;&gt; HE'S LIKE --
&gt;&gt; IT'S NOT A DREAM? IT'S SUPER SWEET.
YOU SEE THE SMILE THAT STARTS TO
FORM IN LITTLE ETHAN'S FACE. THIS HAPPENED BACK IN APRIL IN
CHICAGO, BUT THE VIDEO WAS JUST
NOW POSTED. HE WAS HOSPITALIZED BECAUSE OF
RESPIRATORY INFECTION CAUSED
BECAUSE OF A CONGENITAL DISEASE. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS LIFE
EXPECTANCY WILL BE, ESPECIALLY
AS HE NEARS HIS SIXTH BIRTHDAY, SO THEY WERE REALLY HAPPY THEY
WERE ABLE TO HAVE THIS MOMENT
WITH DAD AS HE CAME HOME. &gt;&gt; DADDY SURPRISED YOU.
&gt;&gt; OVER TO THIS HOMECOMING IN
OHIO. MOM IS HIDING IN THE CAR.
THE CAR BELONGS TO HER DAUGHTER.
SHE'S GOING TO GET INTO SO SHE CAN DRIVE HOME.
&gt;&gt; CREEPY CLOWN MASK?
&gt;&gt; OH, GOD. &gt;&gt; WHAT'S MY GIRL DOING?
&gt;&gt; OH, MY GOD.
THAT EMOTIONAL CURVE. &gt;&gt; NOW MOM'S BEEN IN KANSAS AS
HER HUSBAND PREPARES TO RETIRE
FROM THE AIR FORCE. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THEY GET
TO SEE THEIR MOM SINCE SHE'S
COME BACK TO OHIO, BUT THEY STILL HAVE TO GO DO THE SAME
THING BASICALLY TO THEIR OTHER
DAUGHTER. YOU SEE THE OTHER DAUGHTER OPENS
THE TRUNK, SO MOM GETS OUT OF
THE CAR.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED
KINGDOM HAVE LOST THEIR
COLLECTIVE MINDS. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT BREXIT.
WELL, I KIND OF AM.
IF YOU WATCHED THE NEWS YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THE POUND HASN'T
HAD A GOOD WEEK.
AS SUCH HAS CAUSED ALL SORTS OF PROBLEMS.
&gt;&gt; GO DOWN TO THE MEGA STORE,
THE MEGA STORE. I WENT IN THERE, THEY'VE GOT
NONE!
&gt;&gt; THE MARMA IS GONE! &gt;&gt; YOU CAN TAKE YOUR BREXIT.
YOU WANT THE MARMITE?
&gt;&gt; ONE OF THE HUGE COMPANIES THAT OWNS A LOT OF PRODUCTS
BASED IN EUROPE.
AS SUCH THEY SAID THEY WANTED A 10% SURCHARGE ACROSS THE BOARD.
ONE OF THE BIGGEST RETAILERS IN
THE UK SAID NO. SO THEY STOPPED SENDING
EVERYTHING.
&gt;&gt; MARMITE IS ESSENTIALLY A YEAST PRODUCT THAT IS A
BY-PRODUCT OF THE BEER MAKING
PROCESS. &gt;&gt; I CAN BOIL IT DOWN FOR YOU,
IT'S GROSS.
&gt;&gt; THE BLACK MARKET HAS REARED ITS UGLY HEAD.
&gt;&gt; NO WAY.
HE'S KIDDING, RIGHT? &gt;&gt; WHERE'S THE MARMITE!
&gt;&gt; GOES UP, FOR HOW MUCH?
&gt;&gt; FAST AND QUICK! &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT KIDDING.
IF YOU GO TO eBAY, I FOUND ONE
FOR SALE, $6,100 U.S. DOLLARS. YOU KNOW WHAT, WHY DON'T WE TRY
IT?
&gt;&gt; NO. NO!
&gt;&gt; MARMITE WITH US RIGHT NOW,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. &gt;&gt; CAN I CONFESS I'VE HAD THIS
BEFORE?
&gt;&gt; WANT TO ENJOY THE BEAUTIFUL SMELL OF THIS YEAST EXTRACT.
&gt;&gt; THIS SMELLS LIKE A BAD BOTTLE
OF MEDICINE. &gt;&gt; YEAH.
&gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO EAT IT, THOUGH.
&gt;&gt; EVERYONE'S GOT TO TRY SOME. &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO BE
DISRESPECTFUL.
&gt;&gt; DON'T BE DISRESPECTFUL, JUST MAKE GREAT TELEVISION.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS THE KIND OF THING UK
IS LOSING THEIR MINDS OVER. &gt;&gt; THIS IS DISGUSTING.
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE EATING
CONDENSED -- &gt;&gt; GAYLE'S GOING FOR IT.
SHE'S DIGGING IT.
&gt;&gt; I'VE BEEN TO THE UK FOUR TIMES.
I'VE HAD THIS, IT'S TERRIBLE
STUFF. &gt;&gt; MY MOUTH IS WATERING LIKE I'M
GOING TO VOMIT.
&gt;&gt; MARMITE, IT'S DISGUSTING.</description>

SITUATIONS LIKE THIS.
&gt;&gt; WHOA! &gt;&gt; ACCIDENTS, THIS IS AN
ACCIDENT YOU HAVE TO SEE TO
BELIEVE. WHAT WE SEE UP AHEAD IS A CAR GO
SMASHING INTO A BOWL.
AND HERE WE SEE WHERE THE CAR HAS LANDED ON ITS TOP.
&gt;&gt; EVERYONE'S STAYING AWAY.
&gt;&gt; SURE. &gt;&gt; OF COURSE IT IS.
&gt;&gt; YEAH.
&gt;&gt; OTHER PEOPLE ARE PULLING OVER, AS WELL, AND AT FIRST THEY
KIND OF STAY BACK, BUT NOW THEY
ARE APPROACHING THE CAR BECAUSE THEY REALIZE THERE'S A PERSON IN
THERE AND THEY'VE GOT TO HELP
THAT PERSON. &gt;&gt; WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
COULD BE, YOU HAVE NO IDEA.
&gt;&gt; THIS GUY'S APPROACHING WITH CAUTION.
LOOKS LIKE HE'S TRYING TO GIVE
IT A GOOD LOOK, WHAT'S ON THE GROUND ARE THE WIRES TOUCHING
THE CAR.
&gt;&gt; AND HERE'S THE MOMENT WHERE PEOPLE ALL COME TOGETHER TO
RESCUE THE PERSON IN THAT CAR.

      <description>NOT IN THIS CASE.
THIS IS COMPLICATED.
&gt;&gt; A HOMEMADE DEVICE. &gt;&gt; THIS BABY REVEALING DEVICE IS
ENLISTING THE HELP OF THE
ALREADY EXISTING TWO BABIES. &gt;&gt; GO, BUDDY.
&gt;&gt; GREAT WAY TO GET THE KIDS
INVOLVED IN THIS, TOO, RIGHT? &gt;&gt; RIGHT, AND GET THEM EXCITED
ABOUT IT.
THEY PARTICIPATED IN THE SETUP OF THIS WHOLE THING.
&gt;&gt; IRONICALLY, THIS IS HOW DIRTY
THE HOUSE IS GOING TO BE WHEN YOU HAVE TWO KIDS.
THAT'S AWESOME.
&gt;&gt; I HAVE TO SAY, I'M SO IMPRESSED BY EVERYTHING THAT
THEY USE, THE TOYS, THE DOMINOS,
ALL OF IT. &gt;&gt; THAT IS AMAZING.
&gt;&gt; SO GOOD.
&gt;&gt; WOW. WHAT IS IT?
&gt;&gt; WHO CARES!
WHO CARES! &gt;&gt; WE'RE SO EXCITED WE'RE HAVING
A BOY, BUT WE'RE MORE EXCITED
THAT THIS THING FREAKING WORKS. &gt;&gt; IT'S A BOY!
&gt;&gt; THIS ONE IS A LITTLE MORE
SIMPLE. WE GO TO AMERICA'S PASTIME,
BASEBALL.
&gt;&gt; AH, YES. &gt;&gt; WE LEARN WE HAVE ANOTHER BOY
COMING TO THIS EARTH.
&gt;&gt; WEIRDLY ENOUGH, WE'VE SEEN THESE REVEALS GO WRONG.
THE OTHER GUY IS TOO CAUGHT UP.
&gt;&gt; SO COMPLICATED, YET SO SIMPLE.
CONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYBODY.
&gt;&gt; THIS LOOKS LIKE THE KIND OF STUFF YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN ON A
VELVET PAINTING WITH SOME BLACK
LIGHT. &gt;&gt; YEAH.
&gt;&gt; BUT THESE ARE THE ALIENS
AMONG US. THE ALIENS THAT LIVE RIGHT HERE
ON EARTH.
THIS IS AN EXTREME UP-CLOSE LOOK AT UNDERWATER CORAL.
&gt;&gt; SO BEAUTIFUL.
SO STUNNING. &gt;&gt; ISN'T IT WILD?
&gt;&gt; THE COLORS ARE UNREAL.
&gt;&gt; THE PHOTOGRAPHER GOT THESE EXTREME CLOSE-UPS AND IS SO
MESMERIZING.
&gt;&gt; ANY IDEA AS TO THE SCALE WE'RE SEEING?
HOW FAR HE ZOOMED IN?
THIS IS ALMOST LIKE ALIENLIKE, OTHER WORLDLY.
I WANT TO SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
ZOOMED OUT. &gt;&gt; I WAS WISHING FOR THAT, TOO,
BUT THE PHOTOGRAPHER REVEALS
VERY LITTLE INFORMATION, EVEN KEEPING WHERE THIS WAS SHOT A
SECRET.
HE FEARED IT WOULD DILUTE HIS MAGICAL QUALITY.
THIS IS ALL IN TIME LAPSE, TOO.
SO WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS NOT IN REAL TIME.
HE SAID IT TOOK HIM ABOUT A YEAR
TO COMPLETE THIS PROJECT. &gt;&gt; NO WAY.
&gt;&gt; WHAT?
&gt;&gt; I'M CURIOUS TO KNOW THE LIGHT HE USED, THE CAMERAS, HOW LONG
WERE THEY SET UP OUT THERE,
RIGHT? &gt;&gt; I'VE GOT SO MANY QUESTIONS.
THAT'S THE COOL THING ABOUT THE
VIDEO, IT'S SUCKING US IN, BUT ALSO MAKING US ASK QUESTIONS.
EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT IT.
HE'S A GENIUS!</description>

HOURS AGO AND 43 IN WORCESTER
AND 46 IN NASHUA, NEW HAMPSHIRE, 48 IN BOSTON AND SO WE GOT OCEAN
EFFECT CLOUDS RIGHT NOW OVER THE
CAPE WITH TEMPERATURES THERE IN THE 50s.
KEEPING CLOSE EYE ON THESE WINDS
WHICH HAVE INCREASED IN THE LAST HOUR NOW SUSTAINED TEN TO
15 MILES PER HOUR.
THE BREEZE IS ENOUGH ON TOP OF THE COOLER TEMPERATURES.

      <description>&gt;&gt; Gene: DONALD TRUMP
THREATEDDEN THINK TO SUE TWO
MAJOR PUBLICATIONS AND FIRST LADY AND PRESIDENT ARE TAKING
AIM AT TRUMP AND FELLOW
REPUBLICAN. BLAIR MILLER JOINS US NOW WITH
CONTINUED BACKLASH.
&gt;&gt; Blair: MICHELLE OBAMA DENOUNCED DONALD TRUMP WITHOUT
EVER SAYING HIS NAME BUT SAY IT
HAD SHAKEN HER TO THE CORE. &gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT SOMETHING WE CAN
IGNORE.
&gt;&gt; Blair: FIRST LADY EXPRESSED ANGER AFTER COMMENTS CAUGHT ON
TAPE IN 2005.
&gt;&gt; THIS ISN'T ISOLATED INCIDENT AND ONE OF COUNTLESS EXAMPLES OF
HOW HE HAS TREATED WOMEN HIS
WHOLE LIFE. &gt;&gt; Blair: TRUMP TRYING TO BEAT
BACK THE VIEW OF HIM THE BEST HE
CAN. GROPING AND ASSAULT
FABRICATIONS, AIMED AT STOPPING
HIS CAMPAIGN. &gt;&gt; I NEVER KNEW IT WOULD BE THIS
VILE, THAT IT WOULD BE THIS BAD,
THAT IT WOULD BE THIS VICIOUS. &gt;&gt; Blair: LAWYERS SENDING
LETTERS CALLING FOR RETRACTIONS.
MELANIA TRUMP AND LETTER DOESN'T TAKE ISSUE BUT WITH THE REPORTER
CLAIM SHE BUMPED INTO MELANIA
OUTSIDE TRUMP TOWER A FEW MONTHS LATER AND CONVERSATION THAT
FOLLOWED.
THE LETTER CLAIMS THE TWO NEVER SPOKE AND WERE NEVER FRIENDLY
BUT "PEOPLE" STANDING BY THE
STORY AND NEW YORK TIMES SAYING NOTHING IN THE ARTICLE HAS HAD
THE SLIGHTEST EFFECT ON THE
REPUTATION THAT MR. TRUMP THROUGH HIS OWN WORDS AND
ACTIONS ALREADY CREATED FOR
HIMSELF. TRUMP'S PLUMMETING POLL MAKERS
AND TRYING TO STEM THE LOSSES
AND PRESIDENT OBAMA IS NOT LETTING FORMER TRUMP SUPPORTERS
DISTANCE THEMSELVES TOO FAR FROM
HIM. &gt;&gt; AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR WITHDRAW
YOUR NOMINATION?
YOU DON'T GET CREDIT FOR THAT. &gt;&gt; Blair: ALSO THIS MORNING
SEVERAL TOP GOP DONORS ARE
SAYING TO DISAVOW TRUMP AND IT COULD CAUSE PERMANENT DAMAGE TO
THE PARTY AND TRUMP WILL BE BACK
IN NEW ENGLAND TOMORROW AND MAKING STOPS IN PORTSMOUTH,
NEW HAMPSHIRE AND BANGOR, MAINE.
LIVE IN THE NEWSROOM, BLAIR MILLER, FOX25 NEWS.
&gt;&gt; Sara: HILLARY CLINTON JUST
CAN'T ESCAPE QUESTIONS ABOUT HER PRIVATE E-MAIL SERVER.
THE CONSERVATIVE WATCHDOG GROUP
JUDICIAL WATCH IS SUING CLINTON. LAWYERS JUST TURNED OVER A
SERIOUS OF ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS
RAISED BY THE GROUP IN THE LAWSUIT.
IN HER RESPONSE CLINTON SAYS SHE
USED THE SERVE HE WERE OUT OF CONVENIENCE AND THAT SHE
BELIEVED THE STATE'S DEPARTMENT
WAS ARCHIVING THE E-MAILS. MORE THAN HALF AMERICANS ON BOTH
SIDES OF THE AISLES SAY 2016
ELECTION IS MAJOR SOURCE OF STRESS.
ACCORDING TO NEW SURVEY FROM THE
AMERICAN AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL
ASSOCIATION ROUGHLY 55% OF
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS ARE STRESSED OUT ABOUT THE CHOICES
FOR CANDIDATES.
STUDY ALSO SHOWS OLDER AMERICANS ARE THE MOST WORRIED WITH
MILLENNIALS FOLLOWING SLIGHTLY
BEHIND.</description>

9:00 FOLLOWED BY A SPECIAL
EDITION OF FOX25 NEWS AT 10:00. &gt;&gt; Julie: WE TRACK TRAFFIC AND
WEATHER TOGETHER EVERY TEN
MINUTES. GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE.
SLOW SPOTS RIGHT NOW
CONCENTRATED TO ROUTE 1 APPROACHING THE TOBIN BRIDGE.
93 SOUTH STOP AND GO FROM
MEDFORD INTO SOMERVILLE. 128 SOUTHBOUND LOOKING ACTUALLY
OKAY AS YOU APPROACH 93 AND THEN
THROUGH THE LEXINGTON AREA. DO EXPECT IT TO SLOW DOWN THOUGH
WITHIN THE NEXT 20 MINUTES.
NEW ACCIDENT ON 128 NORTHBOUND NEAR ROUTE 9.
EXPRESSWAY HEAVY STEADY VOLUME
MAKE WAY THROUGH GAS TANK. 35 MINUTES ON EXPRESSWAY, 37
MINUTES ON 128 SOUTH FROM THE
PEABODY AREA DOWN TO THE WESTON TOLLS.
&gt;&gt; Gene: 8:17 TALKING ABOUT
BLUSTERY FALL LIKE CONDITIONS. &gt;&gt; Shiri: STILL A GREAT
WEEKEND TO GO LOOK AT THE FALL
FOLIAGE. &gt;&gt; Shiri: I HAVE A FEELING
THIS WILL BE ONE OF THE NICEST
WEEKS WE HAVE THIS FALL, IN BETWEEN ALL THE SUNSHINE, WARMER
TEMPERATURE, A LITTLE ROUGH TO
TAKE THOSE TEMPERATURES TOMORROW MORNING AND GETTING WARMER AS WE
GO AND IF YOU ARE SEEKING OUT
SOME OF THE REALLY NICE COLOR IN NEW ENGLAND HE HAVE TO SAY
CENTRAL NEW ENGLAND LOOKING LIKE
TO GO SOME OF THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND CENTRAL
MASSACHUSETTS ALSO GETTING PEAK
COLOR INTO NEW HAMPSHIRE. STARTING TO FADE A LITTLE BIT
NORTHERN MOST NEW ENGLAND BUT WE
GOT COLOR MODERATE TURNING IN AROUND THE BOSTON AREA, EASTERN
MASSACHUSETTS, CAPE AND ISLANDS
DON'T REALLY HAVE THE HUGE POPS OF COLOR QUITE YET.
47Â° IN BOSTON RIGHT NOW, LAST
HOUR WORCESTER WAS IN THE 30s, TEMPERATURE ARE STARTING TO GO
UP HERE.
WE GOT SUNSHINE, ALSO GOT A LITTLE WIND AND AS LONG AS WE
HAVE THE WIND IN COOL
TEMPERATURES YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CONSIDER THAT WIND
CHILL.
PULL UP THE FOX25 WEATHER APP, HAS THE TEMPERATURE THERE, ALSO
HAS FEELS LIKE TEMPERATURE SO
YOU CAN ASSESS WHAT YOU'RE DRESSING FOR THIS MORNING,
10:00 A.M. 46Â° BY NOON TIME, 50,
WE GOT WORCESTER TODAY IN THE MID-50s THROUGH THE AFTERNOON
BUT LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS ONCE
THE SUN GOES DOWN, 6:00 P.M. 51Â° AND IF YOU'RE OUT FOR FRIDAY
NIGHT, 8:00 P.M. IT IS GOING TO
GET COLD AND FRIDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL GAMES AS WELL AND
TEMPERATUREWISE GOING TO BE HARD
TO FIND THE SIXTIES OUT THERE. GOT A COUPLE SPOTS LIKE
FITCHBURG AT 60, NORWOOD AT 60
AND UPPER 50s IN BOSTON AND LAWRENCE UP TO NASHUA,
NEW HAMPSHIRE, ABOUT 55 IN
ROCKPORT AND WORCESTER TODAY 56Â°.
FOXBOROUGH 59Â°.
WE GOT MORE OF THOSE MID TO UPPER 50s FOR THE SOUTH SHORE,
MID TO UPPER 50s AS WELL FOR
THE CAPE TODAY, 59 IN BRIDGEWATER AND BROCKTON.
LUCKY TAUNTON AT 60Â° IN THE
AFTERNOON. TOMORROW TEMPERATURES BASICALLY
GOING TO BE VERY SIMILAR ONCE WE
HIT THE AFTERNOON SO MEANS MORE UPPER 50s, LOWER 60s ACROSS
NEW ENGLAND.
I THINK THE DAY IF YOU'RE PLANNING TO SPEND SUBSTANTIAL
TIME OUTSIDE, THE DAY YOU'RE
GOING TO BE A LITTLE MORE COMFORTABLE END UP BEING SUNDAY
JUST BECAUSE TEN DEGREE INCREASE
IN THE TEMPS, TAKES US CLOSE TO 70 IN BOSTON, BEVERLY AT 70 ON
SUNDAY.
NASHUA, NEW HAMPSHIRE AT 71Â°. WE DO HAVE TO GET THROUGH KIND
OF CHILLY TEMPERATURES FIRST
TODAY WE GOT THE BLUSTERY WIND COMING IN FROM THE NORTH,
KEEPING TEMPERATURES BELOW
AVERAGE BUT HEY, WE HAVE THAT SUN OUT THERE.
THE WINDS END UP SUBSIDING ONCE
WE GET INTO THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING IN PARTICULAR.
TOMORROW MORNING THOUGH WE ARE
WAKING UP TO 20s AND LOWER 30s AWAY FROM THE COASTLINE.
THAT MEANS WE COULD BE LOOKING
AT WIDESPREAD FREEZE HERE ALONG THE COASTLINE, FROSTY
TEMPERATURES EVEN IN BOSTON
THROUGH ABOUT 9:00 A.M. THEN DURING THE AFTERNOON
SUNSHINE RULES ALONG WITH
TEMPERATURES CLOSE TO 60. ON SUNDAY WE GOT MORE SUN BUT WE
GOT THOSE TEMPERATURES GOING UP
AS I MENTIONED WE WILL ALSO START TO SEE LATE IN THE DAY
SOME OF THE CLOUDS LEAKING IN
OVERNIGHT SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO
TELL YOU THE SHOWERS.
7-DAY FORECAST WITH THE WEEKEND ALWAYS IN VIEW, 59 BRIGHT AND
BREEZY TODAY, 60 TOMORROW AND 66
ON SUNDAY AND MONDAY WE GOT SCATTERED RAIN IN THE MORNING,
CLEAR OUT IN THE AFTERNOON WITH
HIGH OF 69Â° AND THEN LOOKING AT 70s FOR THE MIDDLE OF NEXT
WEEK WITH PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES.
GENE? &gt;&gt; Gene: SAL DIMASI'S PRISON
TIME COULD BE COMING TO AN END.

SARA.
&gt;&gt;&gt; A NEW REPORT SHOW THAT'S A SURGEON WRONGFULLY REMOVED A
PERSON'S KIDNEY BECAUSE OF A
NAME MIX-UP AT THE HOSPITAL IN WORCESTER.
THE "GLOBE" REPORTS THAT THE
SURGEON WAS SUPPOSED TO TAKE OUT THE KIDNEY OF A DIFFERENT
PATIENT WITH THE SAME NAME.
THEY IDENTIFIED THE PATIENT USING A NAME ON A TEST RESULT
BUT DIDN'T CHECK A SECOND FORM
OF IDEA LIKE A BIRTHDATE. HE FIGURED OUT THE MISTAKE WHEN
THE KIDNEY HE HAD JUST TAKEN
OUT DID NOT HAVE A TUMOR. DURING THE INVESTIGATION INTO
THE INCIDENT, PUBLIC HEALTH
INSPECTORS FOUND SERIOUS SAFETY</description>

      <description>LAPSES AT THE HOSPITAL.
&gt;&gt;&gt; STRANGE BUT TRUE, BUT THIS
WEEKEND'S OYSTER FEST IN WELLFLEET WILL FEATURE NO RAW
OYSTERS BECAUSE THE STATE HAS
CLOSED ALL THE SHELL FISH BEDS OVER A NOROVIRUS OUTBREAK.
THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH
BELIEVES IT IS LINKED FROM CONSUMPTION OF SHELLFISH AT THE
AREA.
STILL PLENTY OF FOOD AT THE FESTIVAL AND THE SHUCK OFF
CONTEST THAT WAS SO POPULAR
WILL STILL HAPPEN. THEY WILL USE OYSTERS FROM
ANOTHER AREA.
NOT A TOTAL LOSS. IT WILL BE A GREAT TIME.
&gt;&gt; Sara:  A PARTY, FOOD, DRINK,
WEATHER ALL GOOD.</description>

      <description>PLAY THE MAPLE LEAFS IN TORONTO
TOMORROW NIGHT.
&gt;&gt;&gt; A POWERFUL SHOW OF SPORTSMANSHIP AT A CROSS
COUNTRY MEET.
A RUNNER FROM HOLYOKE ROLLED HIS ANKLE AND TWO RUNNERS
TEAMED UP AND CARRIED HIM THE
REST OF THE WAY THROUGH A HILLY MILE AND A HALF.
THEY EVEN MADE SURE HE CROSSED
THE FINISH LINE FIRST SAYING THAT IS WHAT THEY WOULD WANT IF
IT WAS ONE OF THEIR TEAMMATES.
THOSE ARE SOME REMARKABLE YOUNG GUYS RIGHT THERE.
&gt;&gt; Sara:  AWESOME.
GREAT KIDS. GREAT ROLE MODELS FOR EVERYBODY
ELSE OUT THERE.
&gt;&gt; Gene:  NOT SURE I CAN FINISH THE JOG LET ALONE CARRY SOMEONE
ACROSS THE FINISH LINE.
&gt;&gt; Shiri:  GOES TO SHOW THE ATHLETICISM AS WELL, I SUPPOSE.
COOL.
NOT AS BAD FOR THIS WEEKEND, BUT IF YOU PLAN ON RUNNING
TOMORROW MORNING, PLAN ON
BUNDLING UP, MY FRIEND. CURRENT WINDS GUSTING AT 25
MILES PER HOUR IN BOSTON AND
PROVINCETOWN. SUBJECT SOUND SO BAD, BUT
COMING UP THE WINDS WILL
INCREASE. AND STAYS BREEZY THIS MORNING.
WINDIEST SPOT OVER AT THE CAPE
WHERE WE COULD SEE GUSTS 30  TO 35 MILES PER HOUR.
THE REST OF US GETTING
20-MILE-PER-HOUR GUSTS. AS WE GET INTO THE AFTERNOON
THINGS START TO SLOWLY LIGHTEN
UP. 2 P.M. BLUSTERY.
AND THE WINDS WILL SUBSIDE.
WITH WINDS WE ARE TALKING WIND CHILLS.
EVEN THOUGH 47 DEGREES IN
BOSTON NOW, IT FEELS LIKE 4. SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE THE FOX
WEATHER APP AND IT WILL TELL
YOU THE TEMPERATURE AND THE FEELS LIKE TEMPERATURE IN YOUR
TOWN AND CITY AND DRESS FOR
THAT. YOU REALLY WANT TO BUNDLE UP IF
YOU ARE FACING BREEZY
CONDITIONS. 8 A.M. 47 DEGREES.
10 A.M. I LIKE THE SOUND OF 52.
NOONTIME, A MID-50s. HIGHS IN THE MID- TO UPPER 50s
IN AND AROUND THE BOSTON AREA.
IT IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE A LONG SLEEVE AND JACKET KIND OF
DAY OUT THERE.
I MEAN IT IS GOING TO BE A VERY FALL-LIKE DAY.
59 THE HIGH IN PORTSMOUTH, NEW
HAMPSHIRE. DOWN TO BEVERLY, BOSTON AND
UPPER 50s.
56 FOR SOUTH SHORE AND CAPE. I HAVE GOT 59 IN BEDFORD.
A COUPLE OF 60s IN NASHUA AND
NORWOOD AND 56 DEGREES TODAY AND WORCESTER WE GET A THAT
WONDERFUL SUNSHINE AND THESE
BREEZY CONDITIONS THAT WE WILL BE CONTENDING WITH FOR THE
FIRST HALF OF THE DAY.
TEMPERATURE-WISE TOMORROW, TEMPERATURE-LIKE TODAY.
UPPER 50s IN BOSTON AND
WORCESTER AND HYANNIS. THEN I PUSH YOU ALL THE WAY
INTO THE LOWER 70s UP IN
CONCORD. WORCESTER AT 66 DEGREES.
69 DEGREES IN BOSTON.
SO WE ARE GOING UP 10 DEGREES HERE FROM SATURDAY TO SUNDAY
AFTERNOON WHICH IS A NICE
WARM-UP. WE GOT TO GET THROUGH THIS
FIRST THOUGH.
TOMORROW MORNING WILL BE YOUR COLDEST MORNING OF MY ENTIRE
SEVEN-DAY FORECAST.
IN FACT A FROST ADVISORY IN BOSTON AND THE COASTLINE MID-
TO UPPER 30s COULD BE THE FIRST
FROST IMPACT OF THE SEASON IN BOSTON AND INLAND TOWNS AND
CITIES FACING FREEZING
TEMPERATURES TO GET THE DAY GOING.
LUCKILY THE SUNSHINE WILL HELP
WARM THINGS UP AND THE SEVEN-DAY FORECAST WITH ALWAYS
IN VIEW WITH A WARM-UP ON 60
SATURDAY AND 66 SUNDAY. 69  WITH SCATTERED-A.
MONDAY, TUESDAY AND THURSDAY,
SOUND OF 70s UNDER PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES.

KNOW THEM VERY WELL.
HE PRETTY MUCH KEPT TO HIMSELF. THIS IS THE NEIGHBORHOOD YOU

HAPPENED.
COMING UP AT 6:00, WE WILL BE TAKING A LOOK AT SOME OF THE

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; POLICE AND NEIGHBORS
RALLYING TOGETHER TO OFFER
SUPPORT FOR THE OFFICERS WHILE THEY HEAL AND WE ARE NOW
HEARING FROM A FORMER OFFICER
WHO KNOWS BOTH MEN. FOX25'S CATHERINE PARROTTA
CONTINUES OUR TEAM COVERAGE NOW
AT MASS GENERAL HOSPITAL THIS MORNING.
GOOD MORNING, CATHERINE.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: GOOD MORNING, BOTH OFFICERS RECOVERING AT MASS
GENERAL HOSPITAL AND NOT OUT OF
THE WOODS YET. REASON TO BE OPTIMISTIC.
VETERAN POLICE OFFICERS AND WE
ARE LEARNING MORE ABOUT THEM EVEN STILL TODAY.
BOTH OF THOSE OFFICERS WERE
SHOT AND WOUNDED WHILE THEY WERE RESPONDING TO DOMESTIC
CALL IN EAST BOSTON.
OFFICER MATTHEW MORRIS HAS BEEN ON THE FORCE FOR 2 YEARS.
SHOT IN A MAJOR ARTERY IN THE
LEG. IN 2006 ORDERED THE MEDAL OF
HONOR THE HIGHEST HONOR AFTER A
ARMED AND MASKED 15-YEAR-OLD BEGAN FIRING INTO A BUS STOP.
OFFICER CINTOLO HAS BEEN ON THE
FORCE FOR 27 YEARS AND THE FATHER OF THREE COMES FROM A
POLICE FAMILY.
BACK IN 1980 HIS FATHER WAS ALSO SHOT RESPONDING TO A
DOMESTIC CALL.
WE TALKED TO A DORCHESTER NATIVE A BOSTON POLICE OFFICER
FOR 35 YEARS.
HE WORKED WITH BOTH WOUNDED OFFICERS.
&gt;&gt; IT IS PRETTY DISTURBING WHEN
ANY POLICE OFFICER, ANYWHERE GETS SHOT.
THEY ARE POINT OF THE SPEAR.
THEY ARE AT THE FRONT LINE. AND WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THAT
HAPPENS TO THEM, IT AFFECTS
EVERYBODY. HOPING THAT THEY WOULD PULL OUT
OF IT OKAY.
I DON'T LIKE TO SEE ANY -- THAT'S -- YOU KNOW THEY WERE
SHOT UP PRETTY BAD, I THINK.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: LEAHY SAID IN ADDITION TO KNOWING BOTH OF
THOSE OFFICERS HE WORKED WITH
OFFICER CINTOLO'S FATHER AND SAYS THE PRAYERS ARE WITH THE
FAMILIES AND WITH MANY PEOPLE
IN THE COMMUNITY. MORE THAN 100 PEOPLE CAME
TOGETHER FOR A PRAYER VIGIL.
THE SIGHTS AND SOUNDS IN ABOUT A AN HOUR.
LIVE AT MASS GENERAL HOSPITAL,
CATHERINE PARROTTA, FOX25</description>

WAS NO CRIMINAL HISTORY FOR MR. FIGUEROA.
IN FACT AS WE ALL NOW KNOW, HE
WAS APPOINTED CONSTABLE FOR THE CITY OF BOSTON JUST LAST YEAR.
COME BACK OUT HERE TO THE
SCENE, AND YOU CAN SEE WE STILL HAVE POLICE TAPE UP.
POLICE JUST PUT THIS TAPE UP
BLOCKING OFF THIS AREA HERE, AND COMING UP AT 5:30, WE WILL
TAKE LOOK AT MR. FIGUEROA
FACEBOOK PAGE. VERY INTERESTING POSTERS HE
MADE.
FOR NOW, JIM MORELLI, FOX25 NEWS.
 MR. IN EAST BOSTON ARE
OVERWHELMED BY OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND PEOPLE IN THE
NEIGHBORHOOD.
CATHERINE PARROTTA CONTINUES OUR TEAM COVERAGE IN MASS
GENERAL WHERE THE OFFICERS ARE
RECOVERING THIS MORNING. GOOD MORNING, CATHERINE.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: RECOVERING.
THERE IS OPTIMISM. THEY WERE BOTH BROUGHT HERE IN
CRITICAL CONDITION AND
RECOVERING AFTER TRANSFUSION AND SURGERY.
MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY CAME
OUT IN A SHOW OF SUPPORT. YOU CAN SEE THIS SCENE RIGHT
HERE INNOCENT PROVE IT THE EAST
BOSTON POLICE STATION. 100 OFFICIALS AND CLERGY CAME
TOGETHER FOR A PRAYER VIGIL FOR
OFFICERS RICHIE CINTOLO AND MATTHEW MORRIS.
THEY WERE REPONDING TO A FIGHT.
OFFICERS DRAGGED HIM AND OFFICER CINTOLO OUT APPLYING
PRESSURE TO THEIR WOUNDS LIKELY
SAVING THEIR LIFE. &gt;&gt; ONE OF THE THINGS HE CLEARLY
SAID TO ME IS I WANT TO THANK
THIS PARTICULAR OFFICER. HE SAVED MY LIFE.
SO HE KNOWS HOW CLOSE HE WAS TO
DEATH. HIS FATHER KNEW HOW CLOSE HE
WAS TO DEATH.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: MAYOR WALSH AND COMMISSIONER WILLIAM EVANS
COMMENDED THE OFFICER OF HOW
WELL THEY TENDED TO THE WOUNDED AND SPOKE OF THE TRANSFUSIONS
THAT LIKELY SAVED THEIR LIVES.
WE ARE LEARNING MUCH MORE ABOUT THE VETERAN OFFICERS INCLUDING
A FORMER OFFICER WHO SERVED ON
THE BOSTON POLICE FORCE FOR 35 YEARS.
WE WILL HEAR FROM HIM THE NEXT
HALF HOUR. LIVE FROM MASS GENERAL
HOSPITAL, CATHERINE PARROTTA,

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL NOW,
DONALD TRUMP IS THREATENING
MORE LEGAL ACTION IF THERE IS NO RETRACTION OF THE STORIES
ABOUT SEXUALLY ASSAULTING
WOMEN. THIS COMES AS A NEW POLL SHOW
HILLARY CLINTON PULLING AHEAD
OF TRUMP. FOX 25'S BLAIR MILLER JOINS US
NOW WITH THE NEW NUMBERS AND
HOW DEMOCRATS ARE NOT PULLING ANY PUNCH IN THEIR SPEECHES.
&gt;&gt; Blair:  THE UMASS LOWELL
POLL SHOW CLINTON HOLDING ONTO A TO A 6-POINT LEAD THAT IS
WHERE MICHELLE OBAMA STUMPING
FOR CLINTON. SHE DENOUNCED HIM WITHOUT
SAYING HIS NAME AND SAID THE
ALLEGATIONS SHAKEN HER TO THE CORE.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT
WE CAN IGNORE. &gt;&gt; Reporter: FIRST LADY
MICHELLE OBAMA DISCUSSED ANGER
AND DISGUST ON DONALD TRUMP'S COMMENTS CAUGHT ON NAPE 2005.
&gt;&gt; NOW SEEMS VERY CLEAR THIS
ISN'T AN ISOLATED INCIDENT. A COUNTLESS EXAMPLE OF HOW HE
HAS TREATED WOMEN HIS WHOLE
LIFE. &gt;&gt; Reporter: TRUMP IS TRYING TO
BEAT BACK THAT VIEW OF HIM THE
BEST HE CAN. FOR ONE CALLING THE REPORTS OF
GROPING AND ASSAULT
FABRICATIONS AIMED AT STOPPING HIS CAMPAIGN.
&gt;&gt; I NEVER KNEW IT WOULD BE
THIS VILE, THAT IT WOULD BE THIS BAD, THAT IT WOULD BE THIS
VICIOUS.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: HAVING LAWYERS SENDING LETTERS FOR RETRACTION.
ME LANE I CAN'T TRUMP TWEETED A
COPY TO "PEOPLE" EDITOR AND CHIEF AND THE REPORTER ACCUSING
DONALD TRUMP OF ATTACKING HER.
THE LETTER DOES NOT TAKE ISSUE OF THE ASSAULT AT M IRK RALAGO
BUT THE REPORTERS CLAIM SHE
BUMPED INTO ME LANE I CAN'T OUTSIDE TRUMP TOWER AND THE
CONVERSATION THAT FOLLOWS.
THE LETTER CLAIMS THE TWO NEVER SPOKE AND WERE NEVER FRIENDLY,
BUT "PEOPLE" IS STANDING BY ITS
STORY. ALSO THURSDAY, THE "NEW YORK
TIMES" REFUSED ANOTHER CALL FOR
A RETRACTION SAYING, IN PART, NOTHING IN OUR ARTICLE HAS HAD
THE SLIGHTEST EFFECT THAT THE
REPUTATION OF MR. TRUMP THAT THROUGH HIS OWN WORDS AND
ACTIONS HAVE ALREADY CREATED
FOR HIMSELF. AMID HIS PLUMMETING POLL
NUMBERS, REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS
ARE TRYING TO STEM THEIR LOSSES BUT PRESIDENT OBAMA IS NOT
LETTING FORMER TRUMP SUPPORTERS
DISTANCE THEMSELVES TOO FAR FROM THEM.
&gt;&gt; AT THE 11th HOUR, YOU
WITHDRAW YOUR NOMINATION? YOU DON'T GET CREDIT FOR THAT.
&gt;&gt; Blair:  THIS MORNING SEVERAL
TOP GOP DONORS ARE URGING THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE
TO DISAVOW TRUMP.
THEY STAY COULD CAUSE PERMANENT DAMAGE TO THE PARTY.
TRUMP WILL BE BACK IN NEW
ENGLAND TOMORROW AND MAKING STOPS IN PORTSMOUTH, NEW
HAMPSHIRE AND BANGOR, MAINE.

      <description>WESTON TOLLS.
BACK TO YOU.
&gt;&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, 5:17. JUST ABOUT 5:18 IN TWO SECONDS.
ON THIS FRIDAY MORNING, IT IS
THE WEEKEND, AND A GREAT WEEKEND FOR TO YOU GO LEAF
PEEPING.
&gt;&gt; I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU I WILL NOT PARTAKE.
HOWEVER MY SISTER -- MY SISTER
WAS IN VERMONT AND SAYS -- SHE HAS BEEN GOING OUT THERE FOR
YEARS AND THE BEST COLOR SHE
HAS EVER SEEN. .
&gt;&gt; Shiri:  NO KIDDING.
THEY WEREN'T TOO HARD HIT BY THE DROUGHT CONDITIONS, AND
COLORS SHOULD BE BETTER THAT
WAY. WE HAVE GREAT COLOR FLEW
VERMONT, CENTRAL AND PARTS OF
NORTHERN NEW ENGLAND. MY WORD OF WARNING IS THIS, I
JUST A LIKE AN HOUR UPDATED
THIS BASED ON REPORTS AND WE ARE ALREADY GETTING FADING
REPORTS OUT OF SPOTS LIKE
NORTHERN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND PARTS OF MAINE.
DON'T GO TOO FAR NORTH.
OTHERWISE PRETTY GOOD COLOR IN MASSACHUSETTS AND SOUTHERN NEW
HAMPSHIRE.
CAPE AND ISLANDS JUST KIND OF TURNING DOWN THERE.
CURRENT CONDITIONS ARE PRETTY
CHILLY EARLY ON THIS MORNING. 52 IN WORCESTER AN THE THREAT
HERE THAT TEMPERATURES KEEP
FALLING THROUGH 7:00 THIS MORNING.
CLEAR SKIES.
THIS IS OFTENTIMES WHEN YOU SEE THAT BIG TEMPERATURE DROP-OFF.
THE ONE THING THAT CAN PREVENT
THAT TOO MUCH MORE IN WORCESTER FACT WE HAVE BREEZY CONDITIONS.
TRACKING WIND CHILLS IN
MORNING. IN BOSTON MAY STAY 42.
FEELS LIKE THE 30s, FOLKS.
TAKE US DOWN 40 DEGREES BY 7 A.M.
ALL SUNSHINE TODAY.
KIND OF EASY FORECAST. 9 A.M. AT 44  DEGREES.
11 A.M., 48 DEGREE.
THIS AFTERNOON WE HAVE 50s. TO ME THAT WILL SPELL OUT A
JACKET FORECAST ALMOST ALL DAY
LONG. IT IS GOING TO BE ON THE COOLER
SIDE.
IT CAN GET UP TO 60 AND MIGHT BE WARM ENOUGH FOR THE SHORT
SLEEVES.
I DON'T THINK IT WILL LAST THAT LONG THROUGH THE EARLY
AFTERNOON.
60s IN FITCHBURG, NASHUA, LOWELL AND LAWRENCE UP ACROSS
THE MASS NEW HAMPSHIRE BORDER.
59 IN BEDFORD AND FRAMINGHAM. 58 IN QUINCY.
56 IN ROCKPORT.
56 IN WORCESTER. UPPER 50s BROCKTON DOWN TO
BRIDGEWATER.
MIDDLE 50s SPANNING SOUTH SHORE AND OVER THE CAPE.
LUCKILY IT IS FUN FOR ALL SO AT
LEAST THAT WILL LOOK GORGEOUS. THERE WILL THAT BE WINDY
ELEMENT THAT WE ARE DEALING
WITH ALL DAY AND GUSTS ABOUT 25 TO 35 MILES PER HOUR.
OVER THE WEEKEND I HAVE 59
DEGREES SATURDAY IN BOSTON AND COMPARABLE TEMPERATURES WITH
WHAT WE HAVE TODAY AND 69
DEGREES ON SUNDAY. SUNDAY BY FAR WILL BE THE
WARMER DAY FOR MANY SPOTS LIKE
BEVERLY AS WELL. WE JUMP IT UP BY 10 DEGREES FOR
SATURDAY AFTERNOON TO SUNDAY
AFTERNOON. AND TOMORROW IN WORCESTER.
AND 65  ON SUNDAY.
I LIKE THE TREND. WEEKEND TEMPERATURES AND KEEP
IN MIND IT IS ALSO ALL ABOUT
THE SUNSHINE TODAY. OF COURSE WE WILL KEEP THE
BREEZY, COOLER AIR IN PLACE.
TOMORROW MORNING WE ARE LOOKING FOR SOME FREEZING CONDITIONS
AND FROST AT THE COASTLINE.
AFTER THAT SUNSHINE FOR THE AFTERNOON AND YOU KNOW WHAT, WE
WOULD DO IT AGAIN ON SUNDAY
WITH TEMPERATURES A LITTLE BIT WARMER.
THUS WE ARE NOT TRACKING THOSE
FREEZING TEMPERATURES ON SUNDAY MORGUE BUT WE COULD SEE PATCHY
FROST.
A FEW LATE-DAY CLOUDS LEADING TO OVERNIGHT SHOWERS INTO YOUR
MONDAY.
MONDAY NOT WASHOUT BUT SCATTERED RAIN AROUND.
70s ARE BACK TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY
AND THURSDAY WITH PARTLY CLOUDY</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; EVERY YEAR ABOUT 440 MEN
DIE FROM BREAST CANCER, AND A
LOCAL MAN SAYS HE COULD HAVE BEEN PART OF THAT STATISTIC IF
NOT FOR HIS DOG.
YOU CAN PICK OUT MIKE WAGNER OF DERRY, NEW HAMPSHIRE AT THE
MAKING STRIDES AGAINST BREAST
CANCER EVENT LAST YEAR. HE PARTICIPATED NOT AS A
SUPPORTER BUT AS A SURVIVOR.
TWO YEARS AGO HE WAS LAYING IN BED WHEN HIS DOG MADE A
DISCOVERY THAT SAVED HIS LIFE.
&gt;&gt; I HAVE THREE JACK RUSSELLS, AND THE ONE BUSTER CRAWLED UP
ON MY CHEST AND HE STARTED
SNIFFING AROUND THE AREA WHERE I HAD THE CANCER, AND HE
STARTED TO NUDGE IT WITH HIS
NOISE, AND I REALIZED I HAD A BUMP THERE.
&gt;&gt; Sara:  WAGNER HAD STAGE 2
BREAST CANCER AND TWO YEARS LATER HE IS CANCER FREE AND HE
WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT OTHER
MEN DON'T GET CAUGHT OFFGUARD. DEFINITELY MAN'S BEST FRIEND.

      <description>TO THE LEVERETT CONNECTOR.
&gt;&gt;&gt; THIS MORNING, TWO BOSTON
POLICE OFFICERS REMAIN IN THE HOSPITAL RECOVERING FROM THEIR
INJURIES DURING THAT SHOOTOUT.
THEY ARE RESPONDING TO A DOMESTIC CALL AT THE TIME.
A REPORTED ARGUMENT BETWEEN
ROOMMATES POSSIBLY OVER A THERMOSTAT.
&gt;&gt; Julie:  BOSTON'S POLICE
COMMISSIONER THE SHOOTER KIRK FIGUEROA MAY HAVE BEEN ARGUING
WITH HIS ROOMMATE OVER THE
TEMPERATURE OF THE APARTMENT AND LIKELY OTHER ISSUES AT PLAY
AS WELL.
POLICE WERE CALLED OF FIGUEROA THREATENING THE ROOMMATE WITH A
KNIFE.
WHEN OFFICERS ARRIVED THEY FOUND HIM WITH A SHOTGUN AND
BODY ARMOR.
HE SHOT AT POLICE AND HE WAS SHOT AND KILLED BY POLICE.
BOTH OFFICERS ARE IN CRITICAL
CONDITION BUT STABLE. AND A TROOPER'S QUICK ACTIONS
THAT LIKELY SAVED OFFICER
MORRIS'S LIFE. OFFICER MORRIS WAS SHOT IN THE
THIGH AND THE TROOPER USED HIS
BODY WEIGHT TO SLOW DOWN THE BLEEDING WHILE A TOURNIQUET WAS
APPLIED.
&gt;&gt; Julie:  WE HAVE NEW DETAILS ABOUT THE SHOOTER, KIRK
FIGUEROA.
HE WAS WEARING BODY ARMOR, IT NOT HAVE A REGISTERED GUN
PERMIT AND WAS A CONSTABLE.
HE ALSO USED ANOTHER NAME ONLINE.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: HIS APARTMENT WAS
YARDS AWAY WHERE KIRK FIGUEROA OPEN FIRED ON TWO BOSTON POLICE
OFFICERS AFTER A FIGHT WITH HIS
ROOMMATE AND THEN WAS SHOT DEAD HIMSELF.
&gt;&gt; ANY TIME SOMEONE PULLS A GUN
DURING SOME KIND OF ARGUMENT, YOU KNOW, THAT JUST CREATES ALL
SORTS OF CHAOS.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: FIGUEROA HAS NO CRIMINAL RECORD IN
MASSACHUSETTS BUT FOX25 PULLED
THIS RECENT DIVORCE FILING WHERE IN HER OWN WRITING, HIS
EX-WIFE SAYS HE ASSAULTED HER
SEVERAL TIMES. PLUS ACCORDING TO AN INDICTMENT
OBTAINED BY FOX25, FIGUEROA WAS
ARRESTED IN ARIZONA IN 2009 AND PLED GUILTY A YEAR LATER IN
GEORGIA TO DAMAGING HIS OWN CAR
BY MEANS OF FIRE AND UNLAWFULLY REPRESENTING HIMSELF VIA
PRIVATE DETECTIVE FROM THE
STATE OF GEORGIA. &gt;&gt; I DIDN'T ACTUALLY KNOW HIM
VERY WELL,
&gt;&gt; Reporter: BUT ON FACEBOOK FIGUEROA WAS KNOWN AS COCO
JENGO.
I FOUND HIS FACE MARK APPLICATION.
QUORAN TRANSLATIONS AND
MULTIPLE ARTICLES WITH POLICE INVOLVED SHOOTING.
HE WAS KNOWN IN THIS
NEIGHBORHOOD AS A GUY WHO KEPT FOR HIMSELF AND MANY KNEW HE
WAS A CONSTABLE FOR THE CITY OF
BOSTON, A MEMBER OF THE ARMY RESERVE, AND SOME SAY HE WANTED
TO EXPAND HIS SECURITY AND
PRIVATE INVESTIGATION COMPANY CODE BLUE PROTECTION.

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; LESS THAN A WEEK TO GO
UNTIL THE NEXT PRESIDENTIAL
DEBATE, DONALD TRUMP IS IN NORTH CAROLINA WHILE HILLARY
CLINTON HEADS TO SEATTLE.
THIS MORNING THE NEW POLL NUMBERS SHOW CLINTON SEEING A
BOOST OF SUPPORT IN NEW
HAMPSHIRE. AS YOU SEE CLINTON LEAD TRUMP
45% TO 3%.
MARK OCKERBLOOM REPORTS AS DONALD TRUMP FACES NEW
ACCUSATIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT.
&gt;&gt; IT IS TO ABHORRENT. &gt;&gt; TEXTBOOK DEFINITION OF
SEXUAL ASSAULT.
&gt;&gt; IT IS CRUEL. &gt;&gt; Reporter: ONE ON ONE
DEMOCRATS DENOUNCE DONALD
TRUMP. &gt;&gt; IT HAS SHAKEN ME TO MY CORE
THAT I COULDN'T HAVE PREDICTED.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: ON DEFENSE. A TAPE OF 2005 RELEASED WHERE
TRUMP IS RECORDED MAKING VULGAR
COMMENTS OF SEXUALLY ASSAULTING WOMEN.
&gt;&gt; IT IS LIKE A MAGNET.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THEN A "NEW YORK TIMES" REPORT FEATURING TWO
WOMEN WHO SAY THAT TRUMP MADE
UNWANTED SEXUAL ADVANCES. &gt;&gt; DID HE ACTUALLY KISS YOU?
&gt;&gt; YEAH, YEAH.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: ON THE FACE OR ON THE LIPS.
&gt;&gt; WHEREVER COFIND A LANDING
SPOT, YES. &gt;&gt; Reporter: SINCE THEN, A
"PEOPLE" MAGAZINE REPORT VERY
COME FORWARD WITH SIMILAR STORIES THAT AREN'T TRUE.
&gt;&gt; THESE CLAIMS ARE ALL
FABRICATED. THEY ARE PURE FICTION AND
OUTRIGHT LIES.
THESE EVENTS NEVER, EVER HAPPENED.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: AND HE HAS
THREATENED TO SUE THE "NEW YORK TIMES".
THE TOPIC SEEMS TO BE AFFECTING
VOTERS. HILLARY CLINTON LEADS TRUMP BY
7 PERCENTAGE POINTS, BUT
TRUMP'S RALLY CONTINUE TO DRAW SUPPORTERS WHO SAY THEY WILL
STAND BY THEIR MAN.
&gt;&gt; I WOULD RATHER HAVE A GUY IN THERE THAT LIKES WOMEN THAN A
CHEATING, LIAR AND THIEF WHO
WILL ROB THE COUNTRY. &gt;&gt; Blair:  THAT REPORT FROM
MARK OCKERBLOOM.
THE FINAL PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE WILL BE WEDNESDAY IN LAS VEGAS.
I WILL BE BRINGING YOU LIVE
UPDATES. WATCH THE ENTIRE DEBATE ON

THIS MORNING AND BY THE TIME YOU WAKE UP TOMORROW MORNING --
WELL, WE ALL WILL BE SLEEPING
IN, RIGHT. WE WILL SLEEP THROUGH IT,
BECAUSE THROUGH 9:00 IN THE
MORNING POTENTIAL FOR FREEZING TEMPERATURES TOMORROW AS WELL.
BLUSTERY BRIGHT AND COOL.
WINDS GUSTING 20 TO 25 MILES PER HOUR.
A NOTICEABLE WIND.
WE HAVE FREEZING TEMPERATURES TO GET STARTED TOMORROW MORNING
AND WE KEEP CONDITIONS DRY
TODAY AND STRAIGHT THROUGHOUT WEEKEND.
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TEMPERATURES
IN THE 40s. ABOUT 44 DEGREES IN WORCESTER
WHICH DOESN'T SOUND TOO BAD.
JUST KEEP IN MIND, TEMPERATURES STILL DROPPING.
WIN FACTOR IN THAT LITTLE
16-MILE-PER-HOUR BREEZE, IT WILL FEEL LIKE MORE IN THE 30s
OUT THERE.
WIND CHILLS THAT ARE ALSO TRACKING AGAIN THIS MORNING.
LOWER 40s BY 6 A.M., STRAIGHT
THROUGH 8 A.M. TEMPERATURES SHOULD BOTTOM OUT
IN BETWEEN BETWEEN 7:00 THIS
MORNING. ALL SUNSHINE.
MID-40s BY 10 A.M.
NOONTIME WE HIT 50 DEGREE. WE GET INTO THE MIDs.
OTHER SPOTS WILL BE A LITTLE
WARMER LAWRENCE AT 48. ACTUALLY WE ARE GOING INTO
BOSTON.
BOSTON AT 49 DEGREES. AND YOU CAN SEE BOSTON HERE
THIS AFTERNOON ALSO IN THE
MID-40s. THIS AFTERNOON, THOUGH, COUPLE
OF 60s LIKE NASHUA, LOWELL,
LAWRENCE OVER TO FITCHBURG. BEDFORD AT 59.
BROOKLINE.
UPPER 50s IN BOSTON. 56 IN WORCESTER AND 59 IN
FOXBOROUGH.
WITH THE SUNSHINE, YES, I AM OKAY.
SOUNDS KIND OF MANAGEABLE, BUT
REMEMBER IT WILL FEEL A COUPLE DEGREES KEEL WHEN YOU GET HIT
BY THAT WIND.
IT WILL TAKE UNTIL THING ON A HOURS FOR THE WINDS TO SUBSIDE.
59 BROCKTON DOWN TO
BRIDGEWATER. 5 IN SANDWICH AND 57 IN
NANTUCKET.
OVER THE WEEKEND KEEPING THINGS MOSTLY SUNNY.
WE ARE PROBABLY GOING TO SEE
MORE -- JUST A COUPLE MORE LATE-DAY SUNDAY CLOUDS.
TEMPERATURE-WISE OVER THE
WEEKEND, 59  SATURDAY IN BOSTON.
68 ON SUNDAY AND WORCESTER 59
TOMORROW. 64 ON SUNDAY.
WE HAVE GOT LOWER 60s IN
FOXBOROUGH HERE ON SATURDAY. BY SUNDAY, THOUGH, IT WILL BE
UP 60s THERE AND IN PLYMOUTH
AND BEVERLY AND ABOUT 70 DEGREES IN NASHUA, NEW
HAMPSHIRE.
KIND OF FEELING A LITTLE MORE LIKE LATE SUMMER BY THE TIME WE
HIT THE FORECAST.
BIG NUMBER ON OUR WARM-UP KIND OF STALLING IT OUT REALLY
LIMITING HOW WARM THINGS CAN
GET BY TOMORROW MORNING. THIS WILL BE OUR COOLEST
MORNING OF THE UPCOMING WEEK.
EXPECTING 20st AND 30s INLAND WHERE WE HAVE THAT FREEZE
POTENTIAL AND ALONG THE
COASTLINE, A FROST ADVISORY BECAUSE MID- TO UPPER 30s ARE
EXPECTED.THAT EVEN MEANS IN
BOSTON WE COULD BE FACING OUR FIRST FROST OF THE SEASON.
FUTURECAST WILL KEEP THINGS
NICE AND BRIGHT STRAIGHT THROUGH YOUR SUNDAY.
NOTHING BUT SUNSHINE HERE AND
JUST A FEW CHANGES BY SUNDAY. MAYBE JUST A COUPLE MORE
CLOUDS.
WE HAVE GOT WINDS THAT ARE GOING TO BE COME FROM THE SOUTH
AND SOUTHWEST AND THAT DOES
HELP WARM THINGS UP. WE HAVE SOME THINGS BREWING
HERE OUT TOWARD NEW YORK STATE
AND CAN AT THAT AND A FRONT THAT WILL END UP COMING THROUGH
WITH A CHANCE OF SHOWERS ON
MONDAY. WE STILL HAVE CONDITIONS JUST
TURNING AS FAR AS THE FOLIAGE
ALONG PARTS OF THE SOUTH SHORE AND THE CAPE.
GREEN OVER THE ISLAND AND PEAK
COLOR THROUGH MUCH OF MASSACHUSETTS, NEW HAMPSHIRE
AND VERMONT.
DON'T GO TOO FAR NORTH BECAUSE THAT COLOR IS TARTING TO FADE.
NEXT RAIN CHANCE ON MONDAY WITH
70s TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY OF NEXT WEEK.
BACK TO YOU.
&gt;&gt; THANKS, SHIRI.</description>

      <description>STANDARD FOR SAFE USE.
THE ISSUE INVESTIGATED.
&gt;&gt;&gt; OCTOBER IS BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH AND DOCTORS SAY
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT MEN CAN
GET THE DISEASE. A NEW HAMPSHIRE MAN IS SHARING
HIS STORY OF SURVIVAL.
FOX 25'S VANESSA WELCH REPORTS, HE CREDITS HIS DOG FOR
REALIZING HE WAS SICK.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: IN THE SEA OF PINK, YOU CAN PICK OUT MIKE OF
DERRY NEW HAMPSHIRE AT THE
MAKING STRAIDZ FOR BREAST CANCER.
HE PARTICIPATED NOT AS A
SUPPORTER BUT A SURVIVOR. &gt;&gt; I WAS LAYING IN BED ONE
MORNING, IN THE SPRINGTIME OF
2014, AND I HAD MY SHIRT OFF JUST LAYING IN BED.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THAT'S WHEN
SOMETHING HAPPENED THAT MIKE SAID SAVED HIS LIFE.
&gt;&gt; I HAVE THREE JACK RUSSELLS
AND THE ONE BUSTER CRAWLED UP ON MY CHEST AND HE STARTED
SNIFFING AROUND THE AREA WHERE
I HAD THE CANCER AND STARTED TO NUDGE IT WITH HIS NOSE.
AND I HAD A BUMP THERE.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: WAGNER WENT TO THE DOCTOR.
&gt;&gt; MY DOCTOR REFERRED ME TO CMC
BREAST CARE CENTER AND THEY DID A BIOPSY AND I FOUND OUT I HAD
BREAST CANCER.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: AT 5 YEARS OLD, WAGNER HAD STAGE 2 BREAST
CANCER.
NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN
CANCER SOCIETY.
THIS YEAR.440 MEN WILL DIE FROM BREAST CANCER IN THE U.S.
IN MIKE'S CASE, LUCKILY A
SURGEON REMOVED THE MASK WITH ROUNDS OF CHEMO TOPPED OFF WITH
RADIATION.
HE IS CAW HUSBANDLY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE.
&gt;&gt; I DON'T HAVE A DEFINITE
UNTIL FIVE YEARS EXPIRES AND THEN I WILL KNOW THAT IT IS NOT
COMING BACK.
&gt;&gt; HIS ADVICE FOR OTHER MEN. &gt;&gt; BUT GOT TO CONFRONT IT.
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T, IT'S
GOING TO TRAVEL SOMEWHERE ELSE, FROM YOUR BODY AND BONES AND
BRAINS WHEREVER IT MAY GO AND
MAY HEAR OLD JOE DOWN THE STREET DIED OF BONE CANCER AND
JOE DOWN THE STREET ORIGINALLY
HAD BREAST CANCER. &gt;&gt; Reporter: VANESSA WELCH,
FOX25 NEWS.
&gt;&gt; Blair:  YOU AND I ARE BOTH DOG LOVERS AND PRETTY
INCREDIBLE STORY WHEN LOOKING
AT IT AND GREAT THAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT.
PROBABLY MEN IN HIS SITUATION
DO NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT. &gt;&gt; Julie:  DOGS ARE SO
INTUITIVE THAT YOU WANT TO PAY
ATTENTION TO THEIR BEHAVIOR.</description>

      <description>FIGHT.
&gt;&gt;&gt; THEY GOT MARRIED BACK IN
AUGUST. THEY'RE HIGH SCHOOL SWEETHEARTS.
IT'S A BIG DAY FOR BOTH OF THEM.
THE VENUE IS ABSOLUTELY STUNNING IN CANADA.
HANNA'S DAD WALKS INTO THE ROOM.
AS HER WEDDING PARTY, HER BRIDESMAIDS START WALKING DOWN.
YOU SEE HER FATHER IS ACTUALLY
PUSHING HER IN A WHEELCHAIR. SHE WAS INVOLVED IN A CAR
ACCIDENT JUST WEEKS BEFORE HER
WEDDING THAT BROKE HER PELVIS. SHE DECIDED THAT INJURY, THAT
ACCIDENT WASN'T GOING TO SLOW
HER DOWN. SHE WAS GOING TO HAVE HER
WEDDING TO THE MAN SHE LOVED.
AS HER DAD IS PUSHING HER DOWN THE AISLE, HER MAN STEWART DOES
THIS.
AND THIS IS WHAT SET THE INTERNET ON FIRE.
HE GOES TO HIS BEAUTIFUL BRIDE
AND PICKS HER UP AND FINISHES THE WALK DOWN THE AISLE
TOGETHER.
&gt;&gt; MOST OF US JUST DO THAT WHEN WE GO, YOU KNOW, INTO THE HOME.
HE'S JUST DOING IT ALL THE WAY
TO THE WEDDING. OH, STOP CRYING.
SHE'S LOSING IT.
&gt;&gt; I JUST THINK IT'S SO PRETTY. &gt;&gt; ISN'T IT WONDERFUL?
BUT THEY STILL DO THE VERY
TRADITIONAL THING. HER DAD STILL HANDS STEWART HER
HAND IN MARRIAGE.
&gt;&gt; USUALLY THE FATHER GIVES HER AWAY.
IT'S LIKE HE LITERALLY TOOK HER
AWAY. &gt;&gt; THE CEREMONY CONTINUES.
THEY HAVE A BEAUTIFUL WEDDING.
WHEN IT'S DONE, HE CARRIES HER BACK TO THE WHEELCHAIR.
NOW IT'S TIME TO PARTY.
&gt;&gt; IS SHE EXPECTED TO MAKE A COMPLETE RECOVERY FROM THIS?
&gt;&gt; WE DON'T HAVE DETAILS, BUT IT
SOUNDS LIKE SHE'S JUST GOING TO NEED TIME FOR HER PELVIS TO HEAL
AGAIN.
&gt;&gt; BETTER OR WORSE, SICKNESS IN HEALTH.
I'LL CARRY YOU WHEN YOU CAN'T
WALK. YOU GO, BOY.
&gt;&gt; THEN IN THE END YOU HAVE
THOSE BEAUTIFUL WEDDING MOMENTS.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; WE REALLY TAKE FOR GRANTED
THAT IF YOU GET IN TROUBLE, YOU
CALL 911 AND, POOF, HELP IS THERE.
NOT SO MUCH THE CASE IF YOU'RE
MOUNTAIN CLIMBERS. CLIMB UP A VERY TALL AND STEEP
MOUNTAIN IN NORTHERN SPAIN.
A PAIR OF CLIMBERS GOT STUCK. THEY COULDN'T GO UP, THEY
COULDN'T GO DOWN.
THEY WERE ABLE TO CALL FOR HELP. BUT HELP CAN'T QUITE GET TO
THESE GUYS.
THIS HELICOPTER WAS ABLE TO JUST BARELY SET A SKID DOWN.
&gt;&gt; I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT.
I CANNOT BELIEVE WHAT I JUST SAW.
&gt;&gt; NOW THE TWO RESCUERS HAVE
BEEN DEPLOYED. THEY'RE RUNNING UP THE MOUNTAIN
TO MAKE SURE THE CLIMBERS ARE
OKAY. THEY ARE.
ALL FOUR GO BACK TO THE AREA
WHERE THE RESCUERS WERE DEPLOYED, AND THE HELICOPTER HAS
TO MAKE A RETURN.
SKID COMES DOWN, TOUCHES DOWN JUST LIKE BEFORE.
NOW ALL FOUR GUYS JUMP ABOARD.
IMAGINE THAT PILOT. THAT'S A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT
WEIGHT LOAD.
IT'S GOING TO FEEL DIFFERENT. &gt;&gt; EVERY TIME SOMEONE STEPS UP,
IT'S GOING TO CHANGE THE DYNAMIC
OF THE HOVER YOU'RE IN. &gt;&gt; ALL FOUR GUYS ABOARD SAFELY.
THERE GOES THE HELICOPTER
DIPPING BELOW THE HORIZON. NOW, CAN'T QUITE SAY THE SAME
FOR THE SKILLS IN THIS NEXT
VIDEO. GOT A GUY WHO HAS LOST CONTROL
OF HIS HEAVY MACHINERY.
&gt;&gt; UH-OH. &gt;&gt; IT'S A FRONT-END LOADER.
LITTLE TRACTOR JUST SPINNING
AROUND AND AROUND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET.
THE BUFFOON WHO LET THIS THING
GET AWAY FROM HIM ALSO DOESN'T QUITE SEEM TO KNOW HOW TO CATCH
UP TO THIS TRACTOR AS WELL.
HE'S RUNNING AROUND IN CIRCLES. THE CIRCLE IS GETTING WIDER AND
WIDER.
IT DID HIT A MEDIAN. THAT'S WHAT CAUSED THE TRACTOR
TO SPORT.
REPORTS SAY IT CLIPPED SOMEBODY. THEY DON'T MENTION ANYTHING
ABOUT INJURIES.
BUT IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT WAS</description>

      <description>SERIOUS.
&gt;&gt;&gt; A WOMAN SAW A SNAKE
SLITHERING IN THE BATHROOM, SO SHE CALLED WILDLIFE AID AND HAD
TO COME IN AND FIND IT.
I LIKE HOW THEY HAD TO START LOOKING IN DRAWERS BLINDLY TO
SEE, ARE YOU IN THERE?
&gt;&gt; IT'S IN THE COTTON BALLS. I KNOW IT.
&gt;&gt; WHERE DO YOU START?
&gt;&gt; THE CAMERA GUY HAD TO START LOOKING BECAUSE SIMON COULDN'T
FIND IT.
&gt;&gt; HE MUST BE A REALLY SMALL SNAKE THEN.
&gt;&gt; CAN YOU SEE SOMETHING?
&gt;&gt; YEP. &gt;&gt; WHAT THE HECK?
&gt;&gt; JUST THE HEAD OF THE SNAKE
RIGHT THERE. &gt;&gt; AW, LOOK AT IT.
IT'S SO SMALL.
&gt;&gt; IT IS SMALL, BUT SIMON SAYS THIS IS A MEDIUM SIZE GRASS
SNAKE.
NOT EXACTLY HAPPY ABOUT BEING GRABBED.
BUT HE LET IT GO OUT IN THE
GARDEN AND HASN'T BEEN SEEN SINCE.
A DIFFERENT TYPE OF ANIMAL
RESCUE HERE. YOU SEE WHAT'S UNDER THERE?
THAT'S A WILD BOAR.
HE'S ABOUT TO POKE IT. &gt;&gt; GOOD HE'S SCARED AND UP
THERE.
&gt;&gt; WAIT, DID HE POKE IT WITH LIKE A TRANQUILIZER OR JUST TO
GET IT OUT OF THERE?
&gt;&gt; IT WAS WITH A TRANQUILIZER, BUT NICK, IT DID NOT WORK
BECAUSE HIS SKIN AND FUR IS SO
TOUGH, THE NEEDLE WAS TOO SMALL TO GET AT IT.
SO IT STARTS RUNNING.
EVENTUALLY THEY GET SOMETHING AROUND ITS LEG.
THEY START PULLING IT UP THE
WALL. FINALLY, AFTER QUITE A FEW
ATTEMPTS TO TRANQUILIZE THIS
THING, THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE IT</description>

SOMEWHERE ELSE.

&gt;&gt; YOU COULD WIN TOO. YOU JUST THESE THURSDAY'S BUZZ
WORD, BE AT LEAST 18 YEARS OLD,

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; THIS IS ESSENTIALLY A TEA
TRAY WITH WHEELS.
HE'S TAKING PART. THESE THINGS QUICKLY GET UP TO
ABOUT 70 MILES AN HOUR.
IF YOU'RE IN ANY OTHER KIND OF RACING, PRETTY MUCH YOU HAVE, I
DON'T KNOW, A SEAT BELT,
HARNESSES, THINGS LIKE THAT. ON A STREET, IT'S JUST YOU AND
THE ROAD.
YOU'LL SEE HERE WHEN HE COMES UP THE INSIDE.
DON'T WORRY.
DOESN'T STAY IN FRONT FOR LONG. EVERYTHING GOES WRONG.
YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS OTHER
ANGLE, WATCH THIS. &gt;&gt; IT LOOKED LIKE HE BOUNCED A
LITTLE BIT.
&gt;&gt; THE WORST. &gt;&gt; IT'S BRUTAL.
HE TAKES US BACK TO SHOW US FROM
HIS ANGLE. YOU SEE BOB HIT ALL THAT STRAW
ON THE LEFT-HAND SIDE.
NOW HE CAN SEE NOTHING THROUGH THE DEBRIS.
JUST MOVES TO THE RIGHT.
&gt;&gt; RUNS RIGHT INTO THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY BRUTAL.
THERE WERE PEOPLE AROUND,
SPECTATORS. SEEING THAT HAPPEN, THEY COME
RUNNING UP.
PEOPLE DRAG HIM BY THE ARMS AND LEGS OFF THE COURSE.
SUPER DANGEROUS AFTER A CRASH
LIKE THAT. BUT IT IS STILL AN ACTIVE
RACEWAY.
&gt;&gt; HE GAVE THEM THE OKAY TO DRAG HIM.
HE MUST FEEL LIKE THE WIND IS
KNOCKED OUT OF HIM AND NOT THAT HE'S GOT ANY SERIOUS INJURIES.
&gt;&gt; I WOULD ARGUE AGAINST THAT.
THIS COME COMES UP AND ASKS -- &gt;&gt; ARE YOU OKAY?
&gt;&gt; NO, I'M IN SO MUCH PAIN.
&gt;&gt; HE'S IN SO MUCH PAIN HE CAN BARELY TALK.
THEY CALL AN AMBULANCE.
AROUND THIS POINT IS WHERE I THINK HE GOES FOR HIS
PRIORITIES.
HE ASKS -- &gt;&gt; IS MY GO PRO ON?
&gt;&gt; THAT A BOY.
&gt;&gt; DID I GET THE FOOTAGE? &gt;&gt; HOW IS HE, BY THE WAY?
&gt;&gt; YOU WILL BE AMAZED TO HEAR
THAT BASICALLY HE HAD BRUISING, WELL, EVERYWHERE.
LEGS, HEELS, RIBS.
THE WORST WAS A REALLY SPRAINED RIGHT ANKLE AND BROKE HIS RIGHT
LITTLE TOE.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S IT? &gt;&gt; YEAH.
HE'S STILL BEDRIDDEN BUT WILL
HOPEFULLY RECOVER SOON.</description>

      <description>MOST FAMOUS FAMILY OUT THERE IN
THE WORLD.
KYLIE JENNER HERSELF SOMETHING LIKE 70 MILLION FOLLOWERS ON
INSTAGRAM, WHICH MEANS --
&gt;&gt; COLBY PERSON CAN HAVE SOME FUN.
&gt;&gt; I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY SHE'S THE
NUMBER ONE KYLIE JENNER LOOK ALIKE IN THE WORLD.
IT'S CRAZY.
&gt;&gt; WE'RE GOING TO SEND HER TO TIMES SQUARE WITH FAKE SECURITY,
PAPARAZZI.
&gt;&gt; THEY'RE GOING TO SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO THROW THE PIN OUT
OF A KARDASHIAN HAND GRENADE.
&gt;&gt; HOW DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO GO?
&gt;&gt; CRAZY.
&gt;&gt; BANANAS. &gt;&gt; TURN UP IN A SWANKY BLACK SUV
AND A COUPLE PEOPLE TO PRETEND
TO TAKE YOUR PHOTO, AND THE SHEEPLE WILL CHARGE.
&gt;&gt; OH, MY GOSH.
THIS IS SO STUPID. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
&gt;&gt; ALL IT TAKES IS FOR SOMEONE
TO CREATE A STIR. WHETHER THEY'RE FANS OR NOT,
THEY JUST WANT TO BE IN ON IT.
&gt;&gt; WATCH THE REACTION. THERE'S PEOPLE TAKING PHOTOS
WITH HER.
THEY'RE GIDDY. THEY'RE FACE TO FACE WITH HER.
NO ONE IS ACTUALLY NOTICING THAT
IT'S NOT KYLIE JENNER. &gt;&gt; THIS ALL HAPPENING SO FAST.
PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TIME TO BE
LIKE, WAIT, HOLD ON, ARE YOU OR ARE YOU NOT?
&gt;&gt; THE CHAOS CONTINUES WHEN THEY
HEAD ACROSS THE STREET AND TAKE OVER A MAC COSMETICS STORE.
&gt;&gt; ONCE THEY GET INTO THE STORE,
IT GETS PROPER OUT OF HAND. &gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE IT'S MADE THEIR
DAY.

THIS IS GREAT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO MAKE

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; I LOVE WHEN "RIGHT THIS
MINUTE" VIEWERS GO TO THE
FACEBOOK AND POST THEIR VIDEOS ON OUR FACEBOOK PAGE.
JACKIE MACK DID JUST THAT.
IT'S SOMEBODY'S BIRTHDAY. NOW, SOMEBODY'S ABOUT TO HEAR
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, BUT SOMEBODY'S
NOT LIKING IT. [ SCREAMING ]
&gt;&gt; I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS IN MY
LIFE. A CHILD LOVES A BIRTHDAY BECAUSE
YOU GET CAKE AND PRESENTS.
&gt;&gt; WELL, IT'S NOT HIS BIRTHDAY. IT'S HER BIRTHDAY.
&gt;&gt; I UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY NOW.
&gt;&gt; WHAT DID YOU DO? &gt;&gt; NOW, IN THIS FAMILY, WE KNOW
WHO THE SUSPECT IS.
&gt;&gt; THE DOG. &gt;&gt; MAYBE, MAYBE NOT.
&gt;&gt; WHAT HAPPENED?
YOU PUT IT ON THE FLOOR? &gt;&gt; NO, I'M TRYING TO CLEAN UP
THE MESS THAT THE DOG MADE
BECAUSE HE CAN'T TALK. &gt;&gt; CODER DID IT?
&gt;&gt; THEY NEVER REALLY FULLY GET A
CONFESSION FROM HER. &gt;&gt; WELL, THAT'S A POSITIVE
BECAUSE THEY SAY THE EARLIER
THAT A HUMAN STARTS TO LIE, THE MORE INTELLIGENCE THEY ARE
BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND
CONSEQUENCES. &gt;&gt; SHE'S JOINING MENSA.
&gt;&gt; DID YOU MAKE THIS MESS?
THE CAT DID IT?</description>

INSTEAD, HE GOT AN UNEXPECTED

&gt;&gt; LET'S SEE WHAT TREVOR HAS TO
SAY NOW THAT HE'S DOWN ON THE GROUND.
&gt;&gt; DO YOU FEEL LIKE A YOUNGER
PERSON RIGHT NOW? &gt;&gt; ACTUALLY, I DO.
&gt;&gt; THEY GIVE IT THE OLD BRO HUG.
&gt;&gt; BUT DID THEY EVER GIVE HIM A TIP?
&gt;&gt; THAT WAS HIS TIP, GIRL.
THEY SHARE A DRINK, THEY SHAKE HANDS, AND THEY GO THEIR
SEPARATE WAYS.
THEY SAY THEY PLAN ON HANGING OUT AGAIN.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS JUST THE START OF
HOPEFULLY A BEAUTIFUL</description>

      <description>TONY AND JULIAN HAVE A VERY
INTERESTING RELATIONSHIP.
IN THIS VIDEO FROM NEWS DOG TV. &gt;&gt; BILLIONAIRE BUSINESSMAN,
TONY, WHO GOES BY LUNATIC LIVING
ON INSTAGRAM, STUNNED FANS WHEN HE ANNOUNCED HIS ENGAGEMENT TO
HIS REALTOR GIRLFRIEND, JULIAN
NICOLE. &gt;&gt; MY LIFE HAS ALWAYS BEEN
SPENDING MONEY ON WOMEN AND
CARS. &gt;&gt; HE'S LOADED WITH CASH.
FROM PURCHASING NIGHTCLUBS IN
HOLLYWOOD, IN CALIFORNIA. SO HE'S MADE A TON OF CASH.
HE SHARES HIS POST OF HIS LAVISH
LIFESTYLE, HIS $3 MILLION JET, HIS $4 MILLION YACHT.
&gt;&gt; THE FIRST TIME WE HUNG OUT,
SHE FOUND THREE GIRLS HIDING IN MY CLOSET.
THAT WAS ONE OF OUR FIRST FIGHTS
WE HAD. &gt;&gt; THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
CALLED THEIR FIRST FIGHT.
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED THEIR LAST FIGHT.
&gt;&gt; SO YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL ME
BECAUSE HE'S GOT MONEY AND A BIT OF A STAR, HE CAN DO WHATEVER HE
WANTS?
&gt;&gt; THAT'S HALF THE PROBLEM NOWADAYS.
&gt;&gt; PEOPLE GLORIFY THIS TYPE OF
BEHAVIOR BECAUSE YOU HAVE MONEY AND WEALTH.
YOU PUT IT OUT THERE, PEOPLE
FOLLOW YOU. YOU THINK THERE'S POWER IN THAT,
BUT YOU'RE CREATING AN ATTITUDE
THAT'S VERY MISOGYNISTIC. PEOPLE ARE CONTINUING TO ENFORCE
IT WITHOUT REALIZING HOW
HORRIBLE IT IS. &gt;&gt; BUT THAT'S NOTHING NEW
THOUGH.
THIS IS THIS GENERATION'S HUGH HEFNER.
HUGH DID ALL THE SAME STUFF.
&gt;&gt; I'M DEFINITELY A JEALOUS GIRL SOMETIMES.
&gt;&gt; I MEAN, IF WE'RE IN THE
KITCHEN, I DON'T GO NEAR HER BECAUSE THERE'S KNIFE SETS.
&gt;&gt; PEOPLE WERE SHOCKED TO FIND
OUT THAT HE ACTUALLY PROPOSED TO HIS GIRLFRIEND.
NOW THEY'RE ENGAGED.
&gt;&gt; THEY SAID I LOST MY TOUCH, I'M NOT THE PLAYBOY ANYMORE.
&gt;&gt; I KNOW THAT TONY HAS THIS
CRAZY LIFESTYLE, THIS INSTAGRAM AND ALL THE PICTURES AND
EVERYTHING, BUT YOU KNOW, WE'VE
GROWN TO TRUST EACH OTHER. I TRUST HIM, AND HE'S DEFINITELY
THE MAN FOR ME.
I LOVE HIM. &gt;&gt; I THINK SHE'S IN IT FOR THE
LOVE OF EVERYTHING THAT COMES
WITH HIM. &gt;&gt; I SEE.
&gt;&gt; I THINK THAT'S WHAT SHE
LOVES. &gt;&gt; SHE ALSO CAN'T GET MAD WHEN
THE GAME TURNS ON HER.
&gt;&gt; MY FAVORITE THINGS IN LIFE. THAT WOULD BE MONEY.
MONEY, MONEY, MONEY, MONEY.
&gt;&gt; THANKS FOR WATCHING.</description>

YOU KNOW WHAT, ALL OF THIS SOUTHEASTERN MASSACHUSETTS IS
NOW ORANGE.
SO WE GONE FROM EXTREME TO SEVERE DROUGHT WHICH IS AN
IMPROVEMENT.
THE CAPE FROM SEVERE TO MODERATE DROUGHT AND NO LONGER DROUGHT
CONDITIONS OVER MARTHA'S
VINEYARD AND NANTUCKET. THOSE LOCATIONS NOW CONSIDERED
STILL ABNORMALLY DRY.
BUT NO LONGER IN A DROUGHT AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE TWO TO
FOUR INCHES OF RAIN THAT WE HAD
OVER THE WEEKEND. SO FINALLY SOME IMPROVEMENTS,
EVEN THOUGH THE SYSTEM A LITTLE
SLOW TO SHOW THEM OFF, TWEET THEM OUT IN MINUTES AND SEE IT
THERE AND SPRINKLES OVER THE
SOUTHCOAST, TRACE OF RAIN IN NEW BEDFORD, MAIN RAIN BACK HERE
INTO NEW YORK STATE ALONG THE
COLD FRONT AND THAT'S GOING TO BE IN THE EVENING HOURS.
BY NOON TIME AND SPRINKLE
POTENTIAL HERE. WE WILL HAVE PARTLY CLOUDY
SKIES.
WE WILL HAVE TEMPERATURES IN THE MIDDLE 60s FOR LUNCH TIME.
IT IS GOING TO BE WARM, DON'T
WANT TO SAY IT IS GOING TO BE HUMID AND NOTICE THE HUMIDITY A
LITTLE HIGHER THAN WHAT &gt;&gt; Shiri: TRACKING STARTING AT
4:00 P.M. AND DON'T THINK IT
WILL BE HIGH IMPACT, NOT SEEING VERY HEAVY REASON, NOT SEEING
VERY MUCH RAIN AND NONETHELESS
DAMP ROADS ALWAYS KIND OF SLOW THINGS DOWN.
TEMPERATURE TODAY WILL GET CLOSE
TO 70Â°. AT THE COASTLINE ITSELF IN
BOSTON, PERHAPS UPPER 60s,
EITHER WAY YOU WANT TO SPIN IT AND ABOVE AVERAGE TEMPERATURES
AND TOMORROW WE GOT BELOW
AVERAGE TEMPERATURES, SO GOT THE SUNNY GORGEOUS FRIDAY ON TAP
WHERE BARELY ABLE TO SQUEAK OUT
THE 60s HERE. ANOTHER ITEM I WANT TO NOTIFY
YOU ABOUT, HURRICANE NICOLE IS
MAJOR HURRICANE, IT IS WITHIN 50 MILES RIGHT NOW OF BERMUDA.
IT IS GOING TO PASS OVER AS
MAJOR HURRICANE. THIS IS A REALLY BIG DEAL FOR
THEM.
NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE INTENSE WINDS BUT BECAUSE OF THE INTENSE
STORM SURGE, THE RAIN, THE
POTENTIAL FOR TORNADOES. THIS IS REALLY BAD NEWS FOR
BERMUDA.
IT IS PASSING OVER TODAY. I BET WITH THE 11:00 A.M. UPDATE
WE GET FROM THE NATIONAL
HURRICANE CENTER THE EYE IS ESSENTIALLY GOING TO BE OVER THE
ISLAND AND GOING TO BE WAVES AT
THE COASTLINE, 7-DAY FORECAST WITH WEEKEND ALWAYS IN VIEW.
AND FREEZING TEMPERATURES, 59
WITH SUN IN THE AFTERNOON AND A LITTLE WARMER ON SUNDAY AND
STILL MOSTLY SUNNY AT 65,
PERFECT WEEKEND GETTING OUT AND MONDAY WE WILL BE TRACKING RAIN
CHANCES AGAIN.
BACK OVER TO YOU, GENE. &gt;&gt; Gene: 8:49.

      <description>&gt;&gt; Gene: LIVE LOOK AT THE
SCENE IN EAST BOSTON WHERE THE
SHOOTING PLAYED OUT LAST NIGHT JUST AFTER 11:00.
&gt;&gt; Sara: ALL UNFOLDED JUST
AFTER 11:00 WHEN OFFICERS RESPONDED TO DOMESTIC
DISTURBANCE INSIDE A HOME.
THERE WAS A SHOOTOUT THAT ENDED WITH TWO POLICE OFFICERS SHOT
AND THE SUSPECT DEAD.
OUR COVERAGE CONTINUES RIGHT NOW.
FOX25 BLAIR MILLER SPOKE WITH
FORMER BOSTON POLICE SUPERINTENDENT ABOUT THE
RESPONSE TO THE                 SHOOTING.
&gt;&gt; Blair: WHILE WAS SHOOTING
WAS HAPPENING ANSWERED THE CALL AND SAVED TWO OFFICERS THAT WERE
SHOT.
&gt;&gt; PUT THEMSELVES IN HARM'S WAY TO GET OFFICERS OUT OF THERE.
THE SERGEANT TOOK AND SAVED HIS
LIFE. &gt;&gt; Blair: HOPING THE FIGHT
CONTINUES AND WOUNDED OFFICERS
FULLY RECOVER. STAY STRONG BOSTON POLICE.
OF COURSE, DONAHUE WAS SHOT
DURING THE BOSTON MARATHON MANHUNT AND LOST A LOT OF BLOOD
THAT NIGHT AND DOCTORS ARE
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE OFFICERS SHOT LAST EVENING.
&gt;&gt; Julie: ROUTE 1 A LITTLE BIT
OF VOLUME BUILDING UP IN SAUGUS AREA.
93 MOVING ALONG FINE UNTIL YOU
GET TO 128. THAT'S WHEN IT REALLY STARTS TO
SLOW DOWN.
AVERAGE SPEEDS 8 MILES PER HOUR THROUGH MEDFORD, APPROACHING
SOMERVILLE.
SHIFTING SLIGHTLY SOUTH THE EXPRESSWAY IS OUR SLOW SPOT FROM
THE BRAINTREE SPLIT UP THROUGH
NEPONSET AND HEAVY STEADY VOLUME THROUGH EXIT 13.
50 MINUTES PIKE EASTBOUND FROM
495 TO MASS AVE. 32 MINUTES ON THE EXPRESSWAY.
ABOUT AN HOUR AND 20 MINUTES ON
128 SOUTHBOUND FROM PEABODY                             TO
THE WESTON TOLLS.
GETTING BREAKS IN CLOUDS AND RUN MOSTLY CLOUDY THIS MORNING.
WE GOT SHOWERS THAT ARE REALLY
GOING TO COME IN HERE ALONG THE COLD FRONT LATER ON THIS EVENING
AND GIVE US BEST SHOT FOR
SHOWERS AND SPRINKLES AREN'T GOING TO LAST AND LAST UNTIL
10:00 THIS MORNING AND BE HERE
BY 9:30 AND A LITTLE BIT OF GROWN OUT HERE TOWARD NEW
BEDFORD AND NORWOOD AND
PLYMOUTH. ELSEWHERE I COUNT ON PARTLY TO
MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES,
TEMPERATURES IN THE MID TO UPPER 50s BY 9:30 THIS MORNING.
BY NOON TIME HOW ABOUT SOME
60s PLUS THE RAIN A LITTLE OVERDONE HERE.
THE CLOUDS ARE REALLY GOING TO
START TO LIGHTEN UP. ONCE WE HIT ABOUT LUNCHTIME AND
INTO THE AFTERNOON WE HAVE
ACTUALLY GOT A PRETTY DECENT DAY ON THE WAY.
SO IF YOU'RE HAVING LATE LUNCH,
OUT THERE TO PICK UP THE KIDS AT BUS STOP AT 3:00 P.M., THIS IS
WHEN WE WILL PROBABLY BE
BRIGHTEST AND WARMEST. THAT LITTLE BIT OF SUNSHINE
PUSHING NORWOOD UP TO 70Â° AND
SHOWERS MOVING OUT TOWARD 495 AND SHORTLY AFTER THAT SO DURING
THE EVENING COMMUTE THEY
CONTINUE THE PROGRESS EASTWARD AND WE DEAL WITH SPOT SHOWERS AS
YOU'RE HEADING HOME.
THAT MEANS WET ROADWAYS FOR THE EVENING COMMUTE, MIGHT SLOW
THINGS DOWN A LITTLE BIT HERE
BUT NOT LOOKING AT SEVERE WEATHER, NOT LOOKING AT VERY
HEAVY SHOWERS.
KEVIN LEMANOWICZ IS GOING TO HAVE A CLOSE EYE ON THEM BUT I
HAVE A FEELING BY 7:00 P.M. WE
WILL BE WATCHING THE SHOWERS FADE PRETTY QUICKLY IN AND
AROUND THE BOSTON AREA AND
PROBABLY BY 9:00, 10:00 AT NIGHT AND CLEAR OUT AND TURN REALLY
WINDY BEHIND THE FRONT.
WE GOT 68 IN BOSTON TODAY, LOWER 70s IN THE SUBURBS, THAT'S
GIVEN ENOUGH SUNSHINE HERE TO
KIND OF HELP GIVE THOSE TEMPERATURES A LITTLE BIT OF A
BOOST BEFORE THAT SECOND ROUND
OF SHOWERS COMES IN THIS AFTERNOON AND FOR THE DAY
TOMORROW ALL SUNSHINE WHICH
SOUNDS FANTASTIC BUT TEMPERATURES BELOW AVERAGE, IT
IS A STRUGGLE TO EVEN GET UP TO
60 AND COUPLE 60s FITCHBURG, NEW BEDFORD TOMORROW, A LOT OF
UPPER 50s WHERE MANY OF YOU
STALL OUT TOMORROW WITH THE WIND GOING TO FEEL EVEN COOLER.
WE ARE ALSO WATCHING THE TROPICS
HURRICANE NICOLE WAS LESS THAN 100 MILES FROM BERMUDA AND
REALLY BIG DEAL AND MAJOR
HURRICANE OVER BERMUDA AND EIGHT INCHES OF RAIN, 8-FOOT STORM
SURGE, POSSIBILITY OF TORNADOES,
THOSE REALLY STRONG WINDS, SO NO DOUBT YOU ARE GOING TO HEAR
ABOUT THIS AND NEWS HERE IN THE
COMING DAY BECAUSE IT IS SHIFTING OVER THE ISLAND RIGHT
AROUND LUNCH TIME AND 11:00 A.M.
UPDATE FROM THE NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER WILL HAVE THE
EYE OF THE HURRICANE VERY CLOSE
TO ISLAND ITSELF AND HEAD INTO FRIDAY AND WEEKEND GET WAVES AT
THE COASTLINE FROM THAT SYSTEM
BUT THAT'S IT. NOW, INTO THE WEEKEND TALK ABOUT
THE SUNSHINE AND CHILLY
TEMPERATURES, 32 WHEN YOU WAKE UP ON SATURDAY, 59 THE HIGH WITH
SUN, MOSTLY SUNNY ON SUNDAY AND
HIGH 65Â° ON MONDAY WE HAVE GOT SOME SHOWERS AROUND.
NOW I WILL SEND IT BACK TO SARA
BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE LATEST ON NORTH CAROLINA.
&gt;&gt; Sara: LET'S TALK ABOUT
THAT. STATE DEALS WITH AFTERMATH OF
HURRICANE MATTHEW AND FLOOD
WATERS TURNED HOME INTO A LAKE AND FLOODING MIGHT NOT STOP ANY
TIME SOON.
RIVERS IN THE AREA AREN'T EXPECTED TO RECEDE UNTIL THE
WEEKEND.
WHILE NORTH CAROLINA CONTINUES TO DEAL WITH FLOODING RELIEF IS
HEADING TO HAITI TODAY.
COMING UP AT 8:00, THE LOCAL TEAM HEADING TO THE CARIBBEAN TO
HELP OUT.
AND AFTER WEEKS OF TESTIFYING ON CAPITOL HILL, THE CEO OF WELLS
FARGO IS FIRED.

IT.
&gt;&gt; CAMPAIGN RELEASED STATEMENT THAT CALLS THE STORY OF

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; Gene: ON SCENE AT MASS
GENERAL HOSPITAL AFTER TWO
BOSTON POLICE OFFICERS WERE SHOT IN THE LINE OF DUTY WHILE
RESPONDING TO DOMESTIC CALL
AT -- IN EAST BOSTON AND BOSTON MAYOR MARTY WALSH JOINING US ON
THE PHONE WITH UPDATE ON THE
SITUATION FOR US. FIRST OF ALL, MR. MAYOR, WE KNOW
IT WAS A LATE NIGHT FOR YOU.
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US BEST YOU CAN ABOUT THE TWO OFFICERS AT
THIS HOUR.
&gt;&gt; BOTH IN CRITICAL CONDITION BUT IT IS A BETTER THAN
SITUATION LAST NIGHT.
&gt;&gt; TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER FOR OBSERVATION DUE TO STRESS AND
TENSE SITUATION AND SAW THAT YOU
PLAYED 911 TAPE EARLY AND VERY STRESSFUL SITUATION OUT THERE.
&gt;&gt; Sara: I IMAGINE ALL THE
PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD QUITE A SHOCK TO
HEAR 25 TO 50 SHOTS FIRED RIGHT
THERE. HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE TO TALK TO
PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY.
&gt;&gt; EVERYONE STAYING IN THE HOUSE AND THERE WAS SPECULATION MIGHT
BE ANOTHER SHOOTER WHICH DIDN'T
TURN OUT TO BE TRUE AND PEOPLE STAYED IN AND COMMUNITY WAS
REALLY -- WAS INCREDIBLE.
&gt;&gt; Gene: SUSPECT IDENTIFIED AS KIRK FIGUEROA.
WAS HE KNOWN TO POLICE AND
PREVIOUS RUN-INS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT YOU'RE AWARE
OF?
&gt;&gt; LOOKING AT IT LAST NIGHT AND TODAY AND SOME POINT LATER ON
TODAY I KNOW THE INFORMATION
WILL BE RELEASED WHEN THEY GATHER MORE INFORMATION ON HIS
STATUS AND WHO HE IS AND WHAT HE
IS ALL ABOUT AND THE CALL WAS A DOMESTIC CALL AND THERE WAS NO
TALK -- NO REPORT ANY GUNS ON
THE SCENE. ARGUMENT GOING ON INSIDE
APARTMENT AND WHEN THE POLICE
GOT THERE AND GUN FIGHT. &gt;&gt; I'M SURE YOU WISH THE BOSTON
POLICE OFFICERS WERE WEARING THE
BODY CAMERAS. &gt;&gt; THERE WAS OTHER OFFICERS
THERE THAT WERE PART OF THE
SITUATION WHAT HAPPENED. &gt;&gt; CAMERA WOULDN'T HAVE
PREVENTED AND GIVEN CLEARER
PICTURE INSIDE THE HOME AND EVERYTHING WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT
TWO OFFICERS BEING SHOT AT AND
SHOT AND RETURNING FIRE AND THE SUSPECT WAS SHOT BY POLICE, I
THINK ENOUGH SAID THERE.
&gt;&gt; Gene: MR. MAYOR AROUND THE COUNTRY THE LASTNTHS
HAPPENED WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT,
POLICE OFFICERS ARE SORT OF UNDER THE MIKE COPE UNDER ATTACK
IF YOU WILL, BUT I THINK WHAT
HAPPENED LAST NIGHT HELPS TO REINFORCE THE DANGER THAT
OFFICERS PUT THEMSELVES IN EACH
AND EVERYDAY THAT THEY ARE ON THE JOB AND STOP THE BLEEDING OF
ONE OF THE OFFICERS SHOT LAST
NIGHT AND HEROIC FASHION AND THESE OFFICERS DIFFICULT JOB AND
I KNOW THAT THERE'S GOOD WITH IT
AND BAD WITH IT AND PROBLEMS WITH THE JOB BECAUSE IT IS NOT
AN EASY JOB BUT LAST NIGHT AND
CITY OF BOSTON WE ARE FORTUNATE NOT TO BE TALKING ABOUT TWO OR
EVEN MORE DEAD POLICE OFFICERS
IN THE CITY. &gt;&gt; Sara: MAYOR MARTY WALSH,
THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS WITH THE
OFFICERS, THEIR FAMILIES AND ALL THE OFFICERS INVOLVED.

FORMER ARMY RESERVIST.

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; WE WANT TO GET BACK TO
BREAKING NEWS RIGHT NOW.
TWO BOSTON POLICE OFFICERS ARE IN EXTREMELY CRITICAL
CONDITION.
&gt;&gt; SHOT IN EAST BOSTON AT AROUND 11:00 FORCING NEIGHBORS
TO SHELTER IN PLACE.
&gt;&gt; POLICE COMMISSIONER BILL EVANS SAID THE OFFICERS WERE
RESPONDING TO A 9/11 CALL FOR
SOMEONE WHO POSSIBLY HAD A GUN. HE SAYS IT WAS SOME KIND OF
ROOMMATE DISTURBANCE ON
GLADSTONE STREET. WHEN THE TWO OFFICERS WENT
INSIDE THE HOME EDED SUSPECT
WHO HAD AN ASSAULT WEAPON AND WEARING A TACTICAL VEST
&gt;&gt; THE OFFICERS WERE SEEN OVER
THE RADIO SCREAMING SHOTS FIRED AND OFFICER DOWN.
OTHER OFFICERS RESPONDED TO THE
SCENE AND INSIDE THE HOME. THEY EXCHANGED SHOTS WITH THE
SUSPECT.
THE SUSPECT WAS KILLED. RIGHT NOW WE DON'T KNOW MUCH
OUT ABOUT HIM.
NINE OTHER OFFICERS WERE TAKEN TO TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER FOR
MINOR INJURIES.
&gt;&gt; Gene:  A TEAM OF REPORTERS COVERING ALL ANGLES OF THE
STORY.
&gt;&gt; Sara:  BEGIN WITH JASON LAW LIVE AT MASS GENERAL HOSPITAL

ARE BEING TREATED RIGHT NOW, JASON.

THE FAMILIES OF THESE TWO OFFICERS ARE AT THE HOSPITAL

MAYOR AND THE ATTORNEY. THE TWO OFFICERS ARE UNDERGOING
SURGERY AND THEIR LAST
CONDITIONS WERE UPDATED AS EXTREMELY CRITICAL.
THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN
SAYING ALL MORNING THE LAST UPDATE FROM THE POLICE
COMMISSIONER THAT THE TWO
OFFICERS WERE DESCRIBED TO HIM BY A DOCTOR AS BEING EXTREMELY
CRITICAL.
EARLIER IN THE EVENING, THE BOSTON POLICE OFFICER SAID THE
CONDITIONS -- ONE OF THE
OFFICERS SUFFERED NONLIFE-THREATENING INJURIES.
THE OTHER SUFFERED
LIFE-THREATENING INJURIES. AT ONE POINT ONE.
 OFFICERS WERE DESCRIBED AS
BEING IN STABLE YOU CONDITION. THE LAST UPDATE WE HAVE BEEN
GIVEN BY THE POLICE DEPARTMENT
THAT THE TWO OFFICERS ARE IN SURGERY AND THEY ARE IN
EXTREMELY CRITICAL CONDITION

HERE IS WHAT THE COMMISSIONER TOLD US THAT THE DOCTOR TOLD
HIM.
&gt;&gt; HE -- HE SAYS THEY HAVE SOME VERY SERIOUS WOUNDS AND THEY
HAVE UNDERGONE SOME BLOOD
TRANSFUSIONS AND HE CLASSIFIED THEM AS EXTREMELY CRITICAL AND
OBVIOUSLY THEY ARE GOING TO
WATCH THEM CLOSELY. ONE IS UP IN THE O. R. RIGHT
NOW BEING OPERATED ON.
I BELIEVE THE OTHER ONE IS GOING UP THERE VERY SHORTLY.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: WE DON'T KNOW THE
EXTENT OF THE INJURIES. THE COMMISSIONER WENT ON TO ASK
EVERYBODY TO PRAY FOR THESE TWO
OFFICERS TO HELP THEM PULL THROUGH.
THEIR FAMILIES ARE HERE AS IS A
LOT OF POLICE OFFICERS. THERE ARE A LOT OF POLICE

      <description>TWO BOSTON POLICE OFFICERS SHOT
IN THE LINE OF DUTY.
BOTH CURRENTLY AT MASS GENERAL HOSPITAL IN EXTREMELY CRITICAL
CONDITION AS WE TAKE A LIVE
LOOK AT THE SCENE THIS MORNING. &gt;&gt; THIS ALL UNFOLDED INSIDE A
HOME ON EAST BOSTON GLADSTONE
STREET JUST BEFORE 11:00 WHEN THE OFFICERS RESPONDED TO A
DOMESTIC DISTURBANCE INSIDE OF
A HOME THERE. THERE WAS A SHOOTOUT THAT ENDED
WITH THE TWO POLICE OFFICERS
SHOT AND THE SUSPECT DEAD. OUR COVERAGE CONTINUES RIGHT
NOW.
FOX25'S BLAIR MILLER SPOKE WITH A FORMER BOSTON POLICE
SUPERINTENDENT ABOUT A RESPONSE
TO THE SHOOTING. BLAIR?
&gt;&gt; Blair:  HE IS VERY DISTURBED
BY WHAT HAPPENED. I JUST TALKED TO HIM MINUTES
AGO.
WE ARE GETTING NEW INSIGHT ON WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT IN
EAST BOSTON.
AND SOME OF THE DETAILS AS WE WERE TALKING JUST CHILLING.
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH
DAN LINSKI. THE FORMER SUPERINTENDENT AND
CHIEF WITH THE BOSTON POLICE
DEPARTMENT. HE HAS BEEN GETTING UPDATES ALL
NIGHT LONG BOTHERED BY THE
DETAILS AS WE HAVE BEEN SHOWING UPDATES.
THERE WAS A RADIO CALL FROM
OFFICERS ON SCENE SAYING SHOTS FIRED.
OFFICERS DOWN.
THOSE OFFICERS WERE HEARD SCREAMING WHAT HAPPENED.
HERE IS WHAT LINSKY SAID ABOUT
HOW THOSE FELLOW OFFICERS ANSWERED THAT CALL.
&gt;&gt; FROM WHAT I AM BEING TOLD
THEY WERE PINNED DOWN AFTER BEING MORE TALLY WOUNDED AND
OTHER OFFICERS INCLUDING
SUPERVISORS COURAGEOUSLY RAN INTO A HAIL OF BULLETS, PUT
THEM THEY WAS IN -- PUT
THEMSELVES IN HARM'S WAY. THE SERGEANT TOOK HIS DUTY BELT
AND PUT A TOURNIQUET ON.
AFTER THE MARATHON BOMBING ATTACK, AND, I AM TOLD, THE
OFFICER IS IN TOUGH SHAPE, BUT

      <description>INTERVIEW WITH DAN LINSKY.
&gt;&gt;&gt; OVERNIGHT, WE SPOKE WITH
THE MAN THAT LIVED A FEW DOORS DOWN FROM THE HOUSE WHERE THE
SHOOTING OCCURRED.
HE DID NOT WANT TO REVEAL HIS NAME, BUT TOLD US THAT POLICE
FLOODED THE NEIGHBORHOOD AFTER
THE SHOOTING AND RACED THE OFFICERS TO THE HOSPITAL.
&gt;&gt; YEAH, THE AMBULANCE LEFT NO
MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES. RIGHT AFTER THAT A BUNCH OF
POLICE ACTUALLY ON MY -- RIGHT
ACROSS THE STREET FROM MY HOUSE.
AND THEY WERE ASKING EVERYBODY
TO GO BACK INSIDE TO KEEP IT UNDER CONTROL.
&gt;&gt; Sara:  THAT MAN TOLD US IT
IS A QUIET NEIGHBORHOOD, AND AFTER THE SHOOTING, EVERYONE
WAS CHECKING ON ONE ANOTHER TO
MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE ALL OKAY.
THEY HOPE THE OFFICERS MAKE A
FULL RECOVERY.</description>

CAN DO.
&gt;&gt;&gt; HER SMILE AND STORY IS ONE WE HAVE COVERED FOR YEARS, AND
NOW 16-YEAR-OLD KYLIE HARRIET,
PARALYZED  BY A STRAY BULLET AS A TODDLER, IS REACHING OUT TO
HELP A YOUNG GIRL FACING HER
OWN ROAD TO RECOVERY. A SHOOTING AT A BOSTON PARK
BROUGHT BACK MEMORIES OF HER
OWN INJURY AND WANTED SOME ADVICE SOMETHING SHE COULD HAVE
USED 13 YEARS AGO.
&gt;&gt; DEFINITELY FOR ME GROWING UP, FLORIDA WASN'T A LOT OF
PEOPLE THAT I LOOKED UP TO THAT
WERE HANDICAPPED OR, YOU KNOW, DISABLED AND COULD RELATE TO MY
SITUATION.
&gt;&gt; DOCTORS ARE NOT SURE IF THE 9-YEAR-OLD WILL BE PARALYZED.
POLICE ARE LOOKING FOR TWO
SUSPECTS IN SUNDAY'S SHOOTING.</description>

MADE HIS NAME.
&gt;&gt;&gt; DESPITE IMPROVEMENTS IN SAFETY ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD, A
NEW STUDY SUGGESTS THAT PLENTY
OF YOUNG PLAYERS ARE STILL GETTING POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS
HEAD INJURIES.
THAT STUDY SHOWS THERE IS A 71% OF SPIKE IN REPORTED
CONCUSSIONS FOR KIDS BETWEEN
THE AGES OF 10 AND 19. MOST OF THOSE HEAD INJURIES
WERE REPORTED DURING THE FALL
AS FOOTBALL SEASON KICKS OFF. MANY STATES ARE TAKING A
TOUGH -- TOUGHER STAND AGAINST
CONCUSSIONS REQUIRING STUDENT ATHLETES TO GET MEDICAL
CLEARANCE BEFORE RETURN TO THE

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; LAWYER FOR DONALD TRUMP ARE
CALLING ON THE "NEW YORK TIMES"
TO RETRACT A REPORT THAT TWO WOMEN CLAIM THAT TRUMP TOUCHED
THEM INAPPROPRIATELY.
THEY SAID THAT TRUMP MADE PHYSICAL ADVANCES.
THE LATEST TROUBLE FOR THE
CANDIDATE. &gt;&gt; Reporter: DONALD TRUMP
TAKING FRESH FIRE OVER THINGS
HE SAID ABOUT WOMEN AND NOW THINGS HE IS ACCUSED DOING.
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" PUBLISHING
ACCUSATIONS BY TWO WOMEN THAT HE TOUCHED THEM
INAPPROPRIATELY.
&gt;&gt; OVER 35 YEARS AGO. HIS HANDS WERE ALL OVER ME.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: COMPLICATING
MATTERS THAT THE ACCOUNTS CLOSELY RESEMBLE HIS OWN
DESCRIPTIONS OF HIS BEHAVIOR.
CONSIDER THE NOW INFAMOUS TAPE OF TRUMP SPEAKING ON A HOT MIC
IN 2005.
&gt;&gt; WHEN YOU ARE A STAR, THEY LET DO YOU IT.
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING.
&gt;&gt; WHATEVER YOU WANT. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE THEM BY THE [BLEEP]
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THAT LANGUAGE IS SIMILAR TO SHE TOLD THE "NEW
YORK TIMES."
&gt;&gt; IT WAS LIKE HE WAS AN OCTOPUS.
IT WAS LIKE HE HAD SIX ARMS.
HE STARTED TO PUT HIS HAND UP MY SKIRT AND THAT WAS IT.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THE CAMPAIGN
RELEASING A STATEMENT THAT CALLS THE STORY A POLITICAL
ATTACK AND READS IN PART, THIS
ENTIRE ARM IS FICTION AND SETS A NEW LOW TO WHERE THE MEDIA IS
WILLING TO GO IN ITS EFFORTS TO
DETERMINE THIS ELECTION. THE CAMPAIGN BATTING AWAY
ACCUSATIONS IN A MAGAZINE
REPORTER WHO SAYS SHE WAS PHYSICALLY ATTACKED BY TRUMP IN
THE MIRALAGO REPORTING ON
TRUMP'S ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY WITH TRUMP'S WIFE, M+ ELANIA.
A TRUMP SPOKESMAN SAID THIS
NEVER HAND. &gt;&gt; JESSICA LEE SAID SHE CAME

JASON.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: YES, GOOD MORNING.
ONE OF THE OFFICERS WAS
ALREADY IN THE OPERATING ROOM. THE SECOND OFFICER WAS BEING
PREPPED FOR SURGERY AND WOULD
BE UNDERGOING SURGERY LATER THIS MORNING AT 2:15  FROM
COMMISSIONER BILL EVANS LAST
GIVING THE MEDIA UPDATE. 12:30 JUST AFTER MIDNIGHT THIS
MORNING THE BOSTON POLICE
DEPARTMENT TWEETED OUT ONE OF THE OFFICERS SUFFERED
NONLIFE-THREATENING INJURIES.
THE OTHER SUFFERED LIFE-THREATENING INJURIES.
AND AT 2:15, THE COMMISSIONER
UPDATED THAT INFORMATION TELLING US THAT BOTH THE
OFFICERS WERE IN EXTREMELY
CRITICAL CONDITION. HE WAS QUOTING THE DOCTOR WHO
TOLD HIM THAT, THAT BOTH
OFFICERS WERE IN EXTREME CRITICAL CONDITION THIS
MORNING.
AGAIN, BOTH UNDERGOING SURGERY FOR THEIR WOUNDS FROM THIS
SHOOTING THAT HAPPENED LAST
NIGHT JUST SEVERAL HOURS AGO. THIS IS WHAT THE COMMISSIONER
TOLD US AT THE LAST PRESS
CONFERENCE. &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT PROUD WHEN WE
HAVE TO USE DEADLY FORCE, BUT
OBVIOUSLY WE HAD TWO OFFICERS GRAVELY INJURED HERE AND LEFT
NO CHOICE.
OUR OFFICERS A REAL BRAVE THERE TONIGHT.
AND, AGAIN, I JUST WANT
EVERYONE TO PRAY -- AND WE PRAY FOR THEIR FAMILIES.
THEIR FAMILIES ARE HERE.
I KNOW WE ALL MET WITH THEIR FAMILIES.
BUT, YOU KNOW, LET'S JUST HOPE
THEY PULL THROUGH. &gt;&gt; Reporter: YEAH, THERE ARE
ABOUT A DOZEN POLICE CRUISERS
HERE PARKED BEHIND US HERE AT MASS GENERAL.
THE FAMILIES, THE MAYOR AND
POLICE COMMISSIONER BILL EVANS STAYING BY THESE OFFICERS'
SIDE AS THEY TRY TO RECOVER.
COMMISSIONER ASKING FOR PRAYERS.
THESE TWO OFFICERS HAVE NOT
BEEN IDENTIFIED YET, BUT VETERANS, 12 YEARS AND 28
YEARS OF EXPERIENCE.
THE LAST PRESS CONFERENCE AT 2:15 WAS RIGHT HERE AT THIS
CORNER OUTSIDE OF THE
HOSPITAL. WE HAVE NOT BEEN TOLD OF THE
NEXT PRESS CONFERENCE OR
BRIEFING BUT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN VERY GOOD
OF GIVING US A HEADS UP ON THE
NEXT PRESS CONFERENCE. AS SOON AS THEY ANNOUNCE THE
NEXT TIME THEY WILL UPDATE AND
ON HOW THESE OFFICERS ARE DOING.
LIVE OUTSIDE MASS AGAIN, A,
JASON LAW, FOX25 NEWS. &gt;&gt; THE SHOOTING HAPPENED JUST
BEFORE 11:00 AS PEOPLE WERE
HEADING TO BED, BUT MANY WERE -- MANY TOLD US, RATHER, THEY
WERE WOKEN BY THE ERUPTION OF
GUNFIRE, AND A SCREECH OF SIRENS.
HERE IS A BETTER LOOK AT WHERE
THIS HAPPENED ON GLADSTONE STREET JUST TO THE EAST OF
SUFFOLK DOWN.
CLOSE TO THE SHRINE. FOX25'S ROBERT GOULSTON LIVE
IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD THIS
MORNING WITH THE LATEST ON THE INVESTIGATION.
ROBERT?
&gt;&gt; Reporter: GENE, YEAH, THIS WAS FOR A DOMESTIC CALL ON
GLADSTONE STREET HERE.
YOU CAN SEE THE ROAD IS BLOCKED OFF AT THIS HOUR.
SOME OF THE POLICE OFFICERS,
BUT MUCH OF THE ACTIVITY IS HAPPENING UP THE STREET.
AGAIN, LAST NIGHT, POLICE GOT
A CALL FOR A DISPUTE BETWEEN TWO ROOMMATES, POSSIBLY
INVOLVING A GUN.
THOSE FIRST OFFICERS WENT INTO 136 GLADSTONE IN EAST BOSTON
AND COMMISSIONER EVANS SAID
YOU COULD HEAR THE OFFICERS SCREAMING ON THE RADIO
"OFFICER DOWN" AND THE RADIO
CODE FOR SHOTS FIRED. THE COMMISSIONER SAID TWO
OFFICERS WERE HIT, ONE OF THEM
MULTIPLE TIMES AND THE OTHER ONCE OR TWICE.
THE SUSPECT WAS ARMED WITH AN
ASSAULT RIFLE AND HE HAD AN ARMORED VEST ON.
THE OTHER OFFICERS RUSHED IN.
THE COMMISSIONER SAID THEY WERE ABLE TO GET THE TWO
INJURED OFFICERS OUT WHEN THEY
KILLED THE SUSPECT. THE SUSPECT HAS NOT BEEN
IDENTIFIED, BUT POLICE SAY HE
WAS IN HIS EARLY 30s. SOME.
 WITNESSES SAY THEY COULD HEAR
THE GUNFIRE. &gt;&gt; SAW LIKE A GUNSHOT.
IT WAS UNMISTAKABLY A GUNSHOT.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: MORE THAN ONE? &gt;&gt; YES.
SOUNDED LIKE IF OFF PARTY
POPPER AND YOU PUT IT RIGHT NEXT TO YOUR EAR, THAT IS IT
SOUNDED LIKE.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: IN THE ORIENT HEIGHTS NEIGHBORHOOD WAS SHUT
DOWN AND THE SURROUNDING AREA
HAD A SHELTER IN PLACE. THAT WAS ALL LIFTED JUST AFTER
MIDNIGHT.
BACK LIVE HERE A MUCH QUIETER SCENE AND INVESTIGATORS PLAN
TO BE WORKING HERE ALL MORNING
WHILE THEIR BROTHER OFFICERS ARE RECOVERING OVER AT THE
HOSPITAL.
WE ARE LIVE, ROBERT GOULSTON,</description>

      <description>THE TIMELINE IN ABOUT TEN
MINUTES.
&gt;&gt;&gt; MORE TROUBLE FOR DONALD TRUMP.
TWO WOMEN HAVE TOLD THE NEW
YORK TIMES THE GOP NOMINEE INAPPROPRIATELY TOUCHED THEM.
THE YOU WOMEN SAY THE ADVANCES
HAPPENED YEARS AGO BUT THEY DECIDED TO COME FORWARD AFTER
THE LEAK OF HIS LEWD COMMENTS.
TRUMP DENIED THE CLAIMS CALLING THEM POLITICALLY
MOTIVATED AND IS NOW
THREATENING TO SUE THE PAPER. IN THE MEANTIME, THE PALM
BEACH POST IS ALSO REPORTING
THAT A WOMAN SAID THAT TRUMP GROPED HER AT HIS FLORIDA
ESTATE.
THAT ALLEGATION HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS.

      <description>WELL.
&gt;&gt;&gt; THIS WEEK'S PLANE CRASH IN
HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT APPEARS TO BE A SUICIDE MISSION
ACCORDING TO LOCAL
AUTHORITIES. THE MAN WAS REPORTEDLY
DISTRAUGHT DURING TUESDAY'S
FLIGHT FIGHTING FOR THE CONTROLS RIGHT BEFORE THE
CRASH.
THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY BACK TO THE AIRPORT WHEN THE PLANE
STRUCK AN UTILITY POLE AND
BURST INTO FLAMES. HE DIED IN THE CRASH, BUT HIS
INSTRUCTOR WAS ABLE TO GET OUT
ALIVE. &gt;&gt; INFORMATION INDICATES THAT
THIS PLANE CRASH WAS
INTENTIONAL, BUT I WANT TO BE CRYSTAL CLEAR.
THE CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND THAT
ARE STILL BEING INVESTIGATED. &gt;&gt; Sara:  THE FBI IS
CONTINUING TO INVESTIGATE.
AUTHORITIES DON'T BELIEVE THIS</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; UPDATING BREAKING NEWS FOR
YOU NOW AT 5:15 THIS MORNING.
TWO BOSTON POLICE OFFICERS ARE SHOT IN THE LINE OF DUTY, BOTH
CURRENTLY AT MASS GENERAL
HOSPITAL IN EXTREMELY CRITICAL CONDITION.
&gt;&gt; THIS ALL UNFOLDED INSIDE OF
A HOME IN EAST BOSTON GLADSTONE STREET JUST BEFORE
11 P.M. WHEN THE OFFICERS
RESPONDED TO A DOMESTIC DISTURBANCE INSIDE THAT HOME.
THERE WAS A SHOOTOUT THAT
ENDED WITH TWO POLICE OFFICERS SHOT AND THE SUSPECT DEAD.
OUR COVERAGE CONTINUES RIGHT
NOW. FOX25'S BLAIR MILLER JOINS US
NOW WITH THE OUTPOURING OF
SUPPORT ONLINE, BLAIR. &gt;&gt; Blair:  GENE AND SARA, FROM
THE FIRST SHOTS OF GUNSHOTS
AND SIREN TO THE PRAYERS POURING IN FOR OFFICERS,
SOCIAL MEDIA IS PLAYING A BIG
PART OF THIS STORY. WHEN CREWS FIRST GOT TO THE
SCENE, WE SPOKE WITH PEOPLE
WHO GOT CAUGHT IN THE MASSIVE POLICE RESPONSE.
WANT TO SHOW YOU SOME VIDEO
FROM ERIC. IT WAS PRETTY QUICK AND COULD
YOU HEAR GUNFIRE AND SEE A
SITUATION WHERE THERE WAS A BOSTON POLICE OFFICER WITH A
SHOTGUN RUNNING BY HIM.
AT FIRST POLICE DIDN'T KNOW IF THERE WAS A SECOND SUSPECT AND
THEY ASKED PEOPLE TO STAY IN
PLACE. ONCE THEY REALIZED THERE WAS
ONE SUSPECT AND HE WAS DEAD
AND THEY GAVE THE ALL CLEAR AND THEN THE FOCUS SHIFTED TO
MGH WHERE DOCTORS ARE WORKING
TO SAVE THOSE WOUNDED OFFICERS.
PEOPLE AND POLICE OFFICERS
ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE SHOWING THEIR SUPPORT FOR THIS.
WANT TO SHOW YOU A TWEET FROM
SAN DIEGO POLICE CHIEF SHELLY ZIMMERMAN WHO SAID ALL OF US
AT SAN DIEGO PD SENDING OUR
THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS TO BOSTON POLICE.
IN THE NEXT FIVE MINUTES SPEAK
WITH DAN LINSKI, THE FORMER SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE.
AND GREAT INSIGHT ON HOW
OFFICERS RESPOND TO SUCH A DRAMATIC INCIDENT.
WE WILL BE BACK IN 30 MINUTES.

OTHER OFFICERS WERE ABLE TO
CHASE TOWN AND ARREST WITHOUT HARMING THEM.

      <description>CONNECTOR.
BACK TO YOU.
&gt;&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, NOW, 5:18 THIS MORNING.
WANT TO CHECK IN WITH
METEOROLOGIST SHIRI SPEAR IN THE STORM TRACKER WEATHER
CENTER.
RAIN COMING THROUGH AND WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY YET.
&gt;&gt; Sara:  YOUR FORECAST BEING
DIFFERENT THAN YESTERDAY. YESTERDAY BEING GORGEOUS.
&gt;&gt; Shiri:  GOOD DAY TO HAVE
OFF. &gt;&gt; Gene:  CAN'T COMPLAIN HERE.
&gt;&gt; Shiri:  HOPEFULLY YOU
SOAKED UP A LITTLE SUNSHINE. TODAY HARDER TO COME UP WITH
ONE WITH BREAKS IN THE CLOUD
COVER. NOTICE RAINFALL TOTALS, A FEW
HUNDREDS OF AN INCH OF RAIN.
MOSTLY PRETTY LIGHT STUFF. WE ARE NOT TALKING HEAVY RAIN
AT ALL.
POSSIBLY A LITTLE EARLY MORNING DRIZZLE BY 10 A.M. AND
EVENING COMMUTE SHOWERS THAT
WE ARE WATCHING. ANY KIND OF RAIN BENEFICIAL
BECAUSE OUR DROUGHT MONITOR
MONITORING THE EXTREME DROUGHT.
I GET THAT UPDATE AT 8:30.
I WILL LET YOU KNOW HOW CONDITIONS ARE HOPING THAT
MAYBE WE SEE SLIGHT
IMPROVEMENTS OVER EASTERN AND SOUTHEASTERN MASS AND GET ALL
THAT WEEKEND RAIN BUT BOSTON
AT 55 DEGREES. JUST THE CLOUDS, MY FRIENDS,
NO SHOWERS YET.
AND VISIBILITY IS STILL GOOD IN BOSTON, BUT WORCESTER KIND
OF STRUGGLING.
SO THERE ARE SOME SPOTS WHERE WE ARE ALREADY SEEING THAT FOG
FORM AND THOSE ARE THE MORE
LIKELY AREAS TO GET A LITTLE MISTY AND A LITTLE BIT DAMP
THIS MORNING.
THROUGH 7 A.M., I AM WATCHING FOR INCREASING FOG.
TEMPERATURE ABOUT 56 DEGREES.
AS WE START TO WARM REASON UP WE WILL SEE THAT FOG
DISSIPATE.
BY 9 A.M., MOSTLY CLOUDY. 58 DEGREES.
11 A.M., 63.
UPPER 60s WITH EXTRA BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS THIS AFTERNOON, BUT
ONCE WE HIT 5 P.M., WE WILL
HAVE TO START TALKING ABOUT SHOWERS AGAIN ESPECIALLY OUT
ACROSS CENTRAL AND WESTERN
MASSACHUSETTS. RIGHT NOW WE JUST GOT SOME OF
THE CLOUDS CREEPING IN.
THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY WE GET INTO THIS DRY AIR.
HERE ARE THE EVENING SHOWERS
COMING IN ALONG THE COLD FRONT WITH THE TIME FRONT ALONG WITH
FUTURE CAST.
BREAK DOWN THAT DRIZZLE POTENTIAL THROUGH 10:00 THIS
MORNING HERE.
NOTICE IT IS NOT WIDESPREAD JUST A COUPLE OF SPOTTY
SPRINKLES.
WILL NOT HAVE A VERY BIG IMPACT ON THE MORNING COMMUTE.
AS KIDS ARE COMING HOME FROM
SCHOOL, WE HAVE PARTLY SUNNY SKIES AND HIGHS 70.
BY 5 P.M. WORCESTER TO NASHUA,
NEW HAMPSHIRE. AREAS OUTSIDE OF 495 STARTING
TO GET WET AND THE EVENING
COMMUTE. WIDELY SCATTERED.
NOT WIDESPREAD.
WORK THEIR WAY EASTWARD INTO THE BOSTON A IRGRAS BETWEEN 6
AND 7:00 IN THE EVENING AND
THEN THE LATER INTO THE EVENING WE GO WE WILL
EVENTUALLY GET INTO SOME
CLEARING SKIES. I THINK BY 9:00 THE ONLY
THREAT OF A SHOWER THAT KEVIN
LEMANOWICZ WILL STILL BE WATCH SOMETHING PROBABLY SIMPLY OVER
OF THE CAPE.
HIGH TEMPERATURES KIND OF A RETREAT TODAY BECAUSE WE ARE
TALKING ABOUT CLOUDS AND RAIN
CHANCES EARLY AND LATE AND OUR HIGHS UPPER 60s TO LOWER 70s
TODAY.
COOLER, BRIGHT AND BREEZY AT 59 DEGREES.
SATURDAY, SUN AND 59.
A LITTLE WARMER WITH 65 DEGREES AND A NEXT CHANCE FOR
SHOWERS COMING IN ON MONDAY.
SARA, BACK TO YOU.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; 5:24 AND FOX25 HAS LEARNED
THE MISTAKE MAY HAVE PUT A
DANGEROUS LEVEL 3 SEX OFFENDER BACK ON THE STREET.
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE
TOLD US THAT HIS OFFICE COULD HAVE ASKED THE JUDGE TO COMMIT
RICHARD GARDNER BEFORE HE WAS
RELEASED BUT THAT DID NOT HAPPEN BECAUSE OF HUMAN ERROR.
31 YEARS AGO HE WAS SENTENCED
TO 131 YEARS IN PRISON FOR RAPING AND KIDNAPPING IN
MASSACHUSETTS.
ONE MOTHER SAID BEFORE HE WAS CONVICTED HE CAME INTO HER
HOME, KIDNAPPED HER SON AT
KNIFEPOINT AND TOLD HER HE HAD EVERY INTENTION OF KILLING THE
BOY.
FOX25 SPOKE EXCLUSIVELY WITH THAT MOTHER WHO CAN'T BELIEVE
HE IS NOW A FREE MAN.
&gt;&gt; JUST AS LONG AS RICHARD GARDNER ON THE STREET, NOBODY'S
CHILDREN ARE SAFE.
&gt;&gt; Gene:  HE WAS SERVED A SUMMONS AFTER ILLEGALLY
VISITING A LIBRARY ONE WEEK
AFTER HIS RELEASE. WE ALSO FOUND GARDNER IS GOING
TO BE LIVING IN SUFFOLK COUNTY.

THEIR TWO-WEEK INVESTIGATION.
&gt;&gt;&gt; A CONVICTED SEX OFFENDER RELEASED FROM PRISON JUST FIVE

BROWN HIT -- HID HIS NAYS COURT YESTERDAY.
POLICE SAY HE CLIMBED HIS
WINDOW OF THE APARTMENT ON THE SOUTH END EARLY TUESDAY MORNING

      <description>TWO OFFICERS ARE IN EXTREMELY
CRITICAL CONDITION.
&gt;&gt;&gt; JUST A COUPLE HOURS AUTOS EVANS, MAYOR MARTY WALSH HELD
A NEWS CONFERENCE TO BRING US
TO SPEED ON THIS. &gt;&gt; Julie:  LET'S LISTEN AS THE
COMMISSIONER BRINGS US UP TO
SPEED ON THE SITUATION. &gt;&gt; OFFICERS RECEIVED A 911
CALL TO 136 GLADSTONE STREET
WITH A DOMESTIC INCIDENT WITH POSSIBILITY OF ONE OF THE
INDIVIDUALS HAVING A GUN.
SEVERAL OF OUR OFFICERS RESPONDED TO THAT CALL.
THEY WENT INSIDE THE PREMISE
OF 136 GLADS TONE STREET, AND AT THAT TIME, WE HEARD
OFFICERS SCREAMING ON THE
RADIO A 303 WHICH SIGNIFIES SHOTS FIRED AND OFFICER DOWN.
THE OFFICERS WERE SCREAMING
"OFFICER DOWN." SEVERAL OTHER OFFICERS WHO
WERE OUTSIDE PROCEEDED INSIDE
AND THEY ENGAGED IN GUNFIRE. OF THE OFFICERS DRAGGED THEIR
FELLOW OFFICERS OUT OF THE
LINE OF FIRE. SO THEY WERE IN A PROTECTIVE
ZONE AND THE OFFICERS
CONTINUED TO ENGAGE IN A GUN EXCHANGE.
AT THAT TIME, THEY WERE ABLE
TO NEUTRALIZE THE SUSPECT WHO WAS ARMED WITH SOME SORT OF
ASSAULT RIFLE WHO ALSO HAD ON
A BALLISTIC VEST AT THAT TIME AND HE WAS NEUTRALIZED.
AT THAT POINT, THE OFFICERS
WITH OUR -- WITH OUR WOUNDED OFFICERS WERE ABLE TO QUICKLY
ADMINISTER FIRST AID, APPLY A
TURN YET. ONE OFFICER HAD HIS -- A
TOURNIQUET.
ONE OFFICER HAD HIS HAND IN THE WOUND WHICH WAS
INSTRUMENTAL IN GETTING HIM
DOWN TO MASS GENERAL. AND THE CONDITION OF THE
OFFICERS RIGHT NOW ARE
CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO THE DOCTOR, DR. STEARNS, AS
EXTREMELY CRITICAL AT THIS
TIME. I ASK THE PUBLIC TO PRAY FOR
THEM.
I KNOW REVEREND JOHN CONNOLLY WAS HERE.
HE CAME DOWN AND ABOUT 50 OF
US GATHERED AND PRAYED FOR THE SAFETY OF OUR OFFICERS
APPROXIMATELY ALL OTHERS HAD
EXTREME COURAGE IN BRAVING A SITUATION THAT WE ALL TOO
OFTEN NEVER KNOW WHAT TO
EXPECT AND THAT IS A DOMESTIC CALL HERE.
I WANT TO THANK MASS GENERAL
FOR THE GREAT CARE. I THINK GETTING THE OFFICERS
HERE QUICKLY.
I KNOW SEVERAL BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS GOING ON AND
RIGHT NOW AGAIN, THEIR
CONDITIONS RIGHT NOW ARE EXTREMELY CRITICAL AT THIS
TIME.
&gt;&gt; Julie:  THAT WAS POLICE COMMISSIONER WILLIAM EVANS.
THAT NEWS CONFERENCE AT 2:15
WAS THE VERY FIRST TIME WE HEARD THE DETAILS, AND FOX25
WAS THE ONLY STATION TO BRING
IT TO YOU LIVE. &gt;&gt; Blair:  ONE OF HIS OFFICER
PUT HIS HAND ON HIS OWN WOUND

THE HEARTACHE HE FEELS DURING
SITUATIONS LIKE THIS. &gt;&gt; EARLY THIS AFTERNOON WAS AT
THE HEADQUARTERS FOR
REMEMBRANCE OF THE OFFICER WHO LOST HIS LIFE IN THE LINE OF
DUTY OFFICER M+ ACERO AND
TODAY TWO OFFICERS WERE SHOT IN THE LINE OF DUTY AND, YOU
KNOW, THIS -- THIS SITUATION
-- THIS JOB IS A TOUGH TIME AND OFTENTIMES PEOPLE DON'T
LOOK AT THE OTHER SIDE OF WHAT
HAPPENS WITH POLICE OFFICERS AND THEY ARE HOPING THAT THEY
MAKE A FULL RECOVERY.
WE KNOW NOW IT IS CRITICAL CONDITION IN THE HOSPITAL HERE
AND THE OTHER OFFICERS THAT
ARE ALSO BEING TREATED WERE AT THE SCENE.
WE HAVE A CHANCE TO GO ANT
MEET AND TALK TO ALL OF THE OFFICERS -- MOST OF THE
OFFICERS INVOLVED TONIGHT.
THEY DID A GOOD JOB OF MAKING SURE THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO DO
WHAT THEY HAD TO DO WITH THE
POLICE OFFICERS IN THE CITY OF BOSTON BUT COMMUNITY BOSTON
WAS SHOCKING FOR THEM.
QUIET NEIGHBORHOOD IN EAST BOSTON AND HAD PEOPLE ARE
CONCERNED WHEN THIS WAS GOING
ON AND WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
I WANT TO ASK THE PUBLIC AGAIN
THE COMMISSIONER TO KEEP THE OFFICERS IN YOUR PRAYERS
TONIGHT AND HOPEFULLY --
HOPEFULLY THEY WILL BE BACK ON THE STREETS SOON.
&gt;&gt; Blair:  BOSTON MAYOR MARTY
WALL TO BE GIVE US AN UP DATE OF THE OFFICER'S STANDPOINTS.
QUESTIONS HOW TO GET TO THIS
CONCERN. JULIE WE ARE WORKING TO GET
ANSWERS ALL THROUGHOUT THE
MORNING. WE WILL HEAR FROM PEOPLE WHO
WERE WOKEN UP FROM PEOPLE WHO
HEARD GUNSHOTS OUTSIDE THEIR HOME.

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; THIS MORNING WE CONTINUE
TO UPDATE THE BREAKING NEWS
OUT OF EAST BOSTON. TWO VETERAN POLICE OFFICERS IN
CRITICAL CONDITION AFTER A
SHOOTING ON GLADSTONE STREET. THIS ALL HAPPENED AFTER 11:00
LAST NIGHT AND WE HAVE BEEN
GETTING UPDATES EVER SINCE THEN.
RESPONDING TO SOME KIND OF
DISTURBANCE OF TWO ROOMMATES. &gt;&gt; Julie:  WE STAYED ON LIVE
LATE INTO THE NIGHT FOLLOWING
THIS BREAKING NEWS. ONE VIEWER SENT US VIDEO AFTER
HE HEARD THE GUNSHOTS.
WE TALKED TO HIM ABOUT WHAT HE SAW AND HEARD [GUNSHOTS]
&gt;&gt; THAT IS ON A LOOP,  BUT
MIKE SAYS THERE WERE PROBABLY 25 TO 30 TOTAL SHOT.
HE WAS AWOKEN BY THEM.
&gt;&gt; HIS GIRLFRIEND HEARD IT. &gt;&gt; AND GRABBED HIS PHONE AND
SHOT VIDEO OF IT.
IN FACT WE CAUGHT UP WITH MIKE ABOUT AN HOUR LATER AND THIS
IS WHAT HE HAD TO SAY TO ONE
OF OUR REPORTERS ON THE SCENE. &gt;&gt; GUNSHOTS FROM OUR BEDROOM
WINDOW.
IT WOKE HER -- WOKE MY GIRLFRIEND UP AND I PULLED OUT
MY PHONE AND RECORDED THAT TEN
SECONDS IT WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE END -- MIGHT HAVE
BEEN A LITTLE MORE AFTER IT.
AT LEAST TEN IN THE VIDEO. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY GUNSHOTS DO YOU
THINK YOU HEARD?
&gt;&gt; MINIMUM 25. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS MIKE TUCKER.
HE IS THE ONE THAT TOOK THE
VIDEO OF WHAT HE SAID. 25 GUNSHOTS WHAT HE HEARD AND
CAPTURED ABOUT TEN OF THEM ON
CAMERA. &gt;&gt; Blair:  PRETTY TELLING
BECAUSE HE HEARD IT AND
GRABBED HIS PHONE AND GOT VIDEO.
OBVIOUSLY IT WENT ON FOR A
LONG TIME. WE SPOKE TO ONE WOMAN WHO WOKE
UP.
MARK OCKERBLOOM AND WITH A NECESSARY IS A STARK TALKED TO
TONI STARK BY PHONE.
&gt;&gt;Caller: I WAS LYING IN BED AND LIGHT THROUGH MY WINDOW BY
THE COPS ON THE STREET AND THE
HELICOPTER AND I TOLD MY ROOMMATE AND I STARTED
RECORDING OUT THE WINDOW AND
WATCHING IT ALL HAPPEN. COP CARS FROM ALL VARIETIES,
MOTORCYCLES, UNDERCOVER CARS
AND THEY BLOCKED OFF THE END OF REED STREET AND I SAW
AMBULANCES COMING.
&gt;&gt; DID YOU HEAR GUNFIRE AT ALL?
&gt;&gt; AT ONE POINT I HEARD A FEW
SHOTS. &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT THIS NIGHT UNTIL
THIS POINT.
IT WAS A NIGHT LIKE ANY OTHER NIGHT.
SEEN ANY ACTIVITY IN THAT
NEIGHBORHOOD? &gt;&gt; NOTHING TO THAT EXTENT
EVER.
I HEARD A COUPLE OF THINGS BEFORE, BUT NOTHING LIKE THIS.
&gt;&gt; HOW IS THIS FEELING RIGHT
NOW? I AM SURE THIS IS A VERY
INTENSE SITUATION FOR YOU.
DESCRIBE FOR US HOW YOU ARE FEELING.
&gt;&gt; A LITTLE BIT JARRING.
I WAS EXHAUSTED. WHEN I GOT UP AND SAW THIS, I
WAS WIDE AWAKE.
&gt;&gt; THAT SUSPECT IS DECEASED AND POLICE ARE REPORTING THAT
THE SCENE IS SECURE.
&gt;&gt; I WAS LISTENING TO THE POLICE SCANNER FOR A WHILE AND
I WAS WORRIED WITH THE
HELICOPTER IN THE AIR AND EVERYTHING THAT PEOPLE WERE
GOING OUTSIDE AND LOOKING IN
THE STREETS. I WAS WATCHING HOPING THAT THE
PERSON WAS HOLED UP BE
SOMEBODY. &gt;&gt; Blair:  THAT WAS TONI STARK
SPEAKING WITH MARK OCKERBLOOM
AND VANESSA WELCH. YOU HEARD HER TALKING ABOUT
GUNFIRE AND YOU DON'T HEAR
THAT WHERE SHE LIVES. &gt;&gt; Julie:  WE WENT ON LIVE AND
STAYED ON LATE WITH MARK AND
VANESSA AND WENT ON LIVE WITH THE NEWS CONFERENCE AT 2:15.
NINE ADDITIONAL OFFICERS AT
TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; SHIRI JOINS US NOW.
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON WAS SO
NICE. GO FOR A REPEAT.
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW TEMPERATURE-WISE
WE WILL HAVE A LITTLE TREAT LIKE YESTERDAY.
STYLE-WISE A PRETTY PICTURE.
AND WE TALK ABOUT RAIN AND HOW MUCH WE NEED IT WITH THE
DROUGHT CONDITIONS.
WE HAVE RAIN IN THE FORECAST AND JUST NOT A LOT OF RAIN YOU
CAN SEE HERE.
FEW HUNDREDS OF AN INCH OF RAIN.
THAT'S IT.
PRETTY SPOTTY STUFF. WILL NOT HELP VERY MUCH FROM
THIS DROUGHT SITUATION.
KEEP IN MIND THIS IS MY DROUGHT MONITOR.
WE ARE TALKING EXTREME DROUGHT
FOR OVER 50% OF MASSACHUSETTS FOR THE TIME BEING IN WILL GET
US UPDATED ONCE A WEEK.
COMING UP AT 8:30 AND I WILL BE SURE TO BRING IT TO YOU AND
I AM HOPING THAT WE CAN JUST
HOLD THIS AS IS INSTEAD OF WORSENING ANYTHING.
PERHAPS WE WILL GET SLIGHT
IMPROVEMENT OVER EASTERN AND SOUTHEASTERN MASSACHUSETTS
WHERE WE HAVE MASSIVE WEEKEND
RAIN. AGAIN THAT COMES OUT AT 8:30.
SEVERAL HOURS AWAY.
54 DEGREES IN BOSTON. COUNTING ON THOSE CLOUDS.
NO RAIN YET.
NO FOG YET WHICH IS A GREAT THING, BUT THOSE ARE BOTH
THINGS THAT I WILL BE WATCHING
FOR THROUGH THE MORNING COMMUTE.
YOU CAN SEE CLOUDS THICKEN UP
AT 8 A.M. WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE MIDDLE 50s.
THAT'S WHERE WE WILL HAVE TO
BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR PATCHY FOG, A LITTLE MIST TO GO ALONE
WITH IT AND JULIE COULD BE
TRACKING DAMP ROADWAY. KEEP WITH US BECAUSE WE WILL
KEEP YOU POSTED ON IMPACTS
EVERY TEN MINUTES. 61 DEGREES.
65 AT NOON.
CLOUDS KIND OF BREAK APART IN THE AFTERNOON AND TEMPERATURES
GET THAT LITTLE EXTRA BOOST
INTO THE UPPER 60s, EVEN LOWER 70s WITH ENOUGH BREAK IN THE
CLOUD COVER.
RAIN NOW -- CLOUDS ARE STARTING TO CREEP IN FROM THE
SOUTH AND THAT'S WHERE THE
MOISTURE IS ALSO GOING TO COME FROM.
I THINK IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF
HOURS THROUGH 7 A.M. IS WHEN WE ARE GOING TO BE WATCHING
FOR THE FOG TO THICKEN UP AND
A COUPLE OF THOSE RAIN DROPS TO KEEP FALLING.
NOTICE NOT A LOT OF RAIN.
IT IS VERY PATCHY. NOT EVERYBODY GETS IT AND
SOMETHING WE WANT YOU TO BE
PREPARED FOR THROUGH 10:00 THIS MORNING.
BY NOONTIME AND DURING THE
AFTERNOON I SUSPECT WE WILL SEE IMPROVEMENTS AND GET THE
BREAKS IN THE CLOUD AND GET
THE MOST SUNSHINE AND TEMPERATURES HEADING UP TO 70
DEGREES.
BUT WE ALSO HAVE THIS BAND OF RAIN THAT IS ARRIVING IN
WESTERN MASSACHUSETTS BETWEEN
ABOUT 3 AND 4:00 THIS AFTERNOON.
THAT MEANS THAT EVENING
COMMUTE IMPACTS WILL BE MOSTLY CENTRAL IN WESTERN MASS.
I THINK A LOT OF YOU WILL GET
HOME BEFORE THESE PATCHY SHOWERS MOVE OVER, BUT
STARTING AROUND 5 P.M., THE
WORCESTER AND FITCHBURG AND BASH IN, NEW HAMPSHIRE.
WE HAVE A POTENTIAL FOR A FEW
SHOWERS OUT THERE. CHECK THIS OUT AT DINNERTIME
WE CAN SEE A LITTLE BIT OF
THAT CLOSE TO BOSTON AND OVER TOWARD EASTERN MASSACHUSETTS.
IT IS MORE LIKE 7 OR 8:00 HERE
THAT WE ARE TIMING OUT SOME OF THE SHOWERS IN AND AROUND THE
BOSTON AREA.
WE COULD SEE THE FIRST LOW DOWN HERE BY A LITTLE BIT.
CHECK BACK WITH US HERE
BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING WE ARE WATCHING HERE ALL MORNING
LONG.
KEVIN LEMANOWICZ WILL BE WATCHING FOR IT ON FOX25 HERE
STARTING AT 4 P.M. 9 P.M.,
GOOD NEWS THE ONLY SHOWERS OFFER THE CAPE AND THEN WE ARE
DONE.
HIGHS TODAY COMING CLOSE TO 70 DEGREES.
A NICE LITTLE WARM-UP THAT
DOESN'T LAST US VERY LONG BACK INTO THE 40s OVERNIGHT EVEN
THOUGH WE HAVE THAT EVENING
RISK OF SHOWERS. SKIES CLEAR UP AFTER MIDNIGHT.
WINDS PICK.
YOU LOOK AT THESE WINDS, 10 TO 20 MILES PER HOUR.
GUSTS WILL BE CLOSER TO 30.
EVEN THOUGH I AM GIVING YOU HIGH TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER
50s TO ABOUT 60  DEGREES, KEEP
IN MIND WILL FEEL A LITTLE COOLER BECAUSE OF THESE WINDS.
WINDS GUSTING AS WE LOOK AT
THAT HOUR BY HOUR WIND FORECAST.
CLOSE TO 30 MILES PER HOUR.
ESPECIALLY OVER THE CAPE. MY BREEZIEST SPOT HERE AND
TOMORROW MORNING, THAT COULD
BOIL DOWN TO WIND CHILLS EASE HEE IN THE 30s.
SEVEN-DAY FORECAST, SUNSHINE
FOR THE DAY TOMORROW FOLLOWING TODAY'S CHANCE OF SHOWERS.
WE HAVE SUNSHINE OVER THE
WEEKEND WITH HIGHS IN THE 50s AND 60s.
AND A LITTLE MORE RAIN HERE
FOR YOUR MONDAY.</description>

      <description>ACCIDENT.
&gt;&gt; HE IS SO GLAD TO BE ALIVE.
&gt;&gt; NOW SEE THE TWIST IN THIS STORY THAT'S TAKING SOCIAL MEDIA
BY STORM.
&gt;&gt; WOW. &gt;&gt; SOME OF THE BEST MEDICINE
THIS GUY COULD HAVE GOTTEN.
&gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; THEY SAY YOU REALLY DON'T
UNDERSTAND PEOPLE UNLESS YOU
WALKED A MILE IN SOMEONE ELSE'S SHOES.
OR JUST FALLEN A MILE IN SOMEONE
ELSE'S SHOES. THIS GUY, HE'S ABOUT TO GO SKY
DIVING WITH HIS BUDDY.
THEY JUMP AT THE SAME TIME FROM THE AIRPLANE.
ONE GUY HAS SOMETHING IN HIS
HAND. LET'S SEE WHAT IT IS.
SEE THAT FLYING BY?
THAT WAS HIS BUDDY'S SHOE. WHEN HE LEFT OFF HIS BUDDY, HE
TOOK SOME GUY'S SHOE WITH HIM.
&gt;&gt; ARE THEY NIKE AIRS? &gt;&gt; DID HE PULL HIS SHOE OFF ON
PURPOSE LIKE A PRANK?
&gt;&gt; YES, HE PULLED IT OFF ON PURPOSE, BUT HIS BUDDY HERE
SPENDS THE REST OF THE TIME
TRYING TO CATCH UP WITH THAT SHOE, BECAUSE, WATCH, THERE IT
GOES FLYING BY.
&gt;&gt; IF HE CATCHES THIS, I'LL BE SO IMPRESSED.
&gt;&gt; DID HE GET IT?
DID HE GET IT? &gt;&gt; MY GOD.
YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING.
&gt;&gt; I'M SO IMPRESSED. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
&gt;&gt; CAUGHT HIS OWN SHOE OUT OF
MIDAIR. &gt;&gt; CAUGHT HIS OWN SHOE OUT OF
MIDAIR.
THAT SHOE GOES BY IN THREE SEPARATE TIMES BEFORE IT COMES
RIGHT AT HIM, HITS HIM IN THE
CHEST. HE'S ABLE TO GRAB IT.
THEN HE PUTS THE SHOE ON.
&gt;&gt; INCREDIBLE. &gt;&gt; I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
SPEECHLESS.
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT WORKED. SO HERE HE COMES FOR THE
LANDING.
SEE HIM LAND JUST FINE, BECAUSE HE'S DONE THIS BEFORE.
THEN HE SHOWS US HIS FEET.
&gt;&gt; THEY CAN BARELY PUT THEIR SHOES ON IN THE MORNING SITTING
ON THE STAIRS.
&gt;&gt; LOOK, HE HAD A MARK ON THE STEPS FROM WHERE IT HIT HIM.
&gt;&gt; BETTER A MARK THAN GOING
SPLAT. &gt;&gt; GOING TO SLEEP ONE PERSON AND
WAKING UP SOMEONE ELSE IS REALLY
DIFFICULT. NO ONE CAN PREPARE YOU FOR
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
&gt;&gt; OH, MY GOSH, WHAT HAPPENED? &gt;&gt; CARLIE BUTLER WAS 23 YEARS
OLD IN GRAD SCHOOL.
SHE SAYS SHE WAS LIVING THE LIFE OF HER DREAMS.
SHE WAS VISITING HER COUSIN IN
CHICAGO WHEN SUDDENLY EVERYTHING CHANGED.
&gt;&gt; I KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG.
I TOOK OFF RUNNING TOWARDS MY CAR.
SHE HAD A GUN.
I PUT MY HANDS UP IMMEDIATELY, AND I
&gt;&gt; UNPROVOKED ATTACK, WHAT
CAUSED THIS? &gt;&gt; IT WAS AN UNPROVOKED ATTACK.
SHE STARTED SCREAMING FOR HELP
AND HER COUSIN HEARD HER. &gt;&gt; I HEARD SCREAMING FROM
OUTSIDE, HELP, HELP, RAQUEL,
HELP ME. WHAT HAPPENED?
SHE'S LIKE, THOSE GIRLS, THEY
THREW ACID ON ME. I REMEMBER MY SKIN FALLING OFF
MY FACE.
&gt;&gt; OH, MY GOSH. &gt;&gt; SERIOUSLY, HOW DO YOU DO THAT
TO SOMEONE?
&gt;&gt; SHE NEVER GOT ANSWERS WHY THIS HAPPENED TO HER.
&gt;&gt; THIRD DEGREE BURNS TO 30% OF
MY BODY AND START UNDERGOING A SERIES OF SURGERIES.
I'VE HAD AT LEAST 15.
&gt;&gt; DID SHE EVER GET ANY KIND OF JUSTICE AT ALL?
WERE THESE PEOPLE EVER CAUGHT?
&gt;&gt; HER ATTACKERS WERE CAUGHT AND THEY WERE SENTENCED TO 15 YEARS
IN JAIL, BUT SHE DOES SAY SHE'S
FORGIVEN THEM. &gt;&gt; TO THIS DAY I DON'T HAVE THE
ANSWERS THAT I WANT.
I WAS ANGRY AND ALSO CONFUSED ABOUT WHY THEY'D DO SOMETHING SO
HEINOUS, BUT ALL THAT NEGATIVE
ENERGY WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTING MY OWN LIFE, SO OVER TIME I JUST
WAS LIKE I CAN'T LIVE LIKE THIS.
I'VE FORGIVEN EVERYONE INVOLVED. I HAVE NO ILL WILL.
&gt;&gt; SHE'S MADE A REMARKABLE
RECOVERY. &gt;&gt; SHE STARTED A WEBSITE.
&gt;&gt; REALLY GREAT PLACE IN MY
LIFE, I'M WORKING WITH YOUNG WOMEN, AND I HAVE AN AMAZING
4-YEAR-OLD SON, AND MY
EXPERIENCES ARE ACTUALLY BRINGING A LOT OF AMAZING
OPPORTUNITIES TO MY LIFE THAT I
OTHERWISE DON'T THINK I WOULD HAVE.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S INCREDIBLY INSPIRING.
&gt;&gt; AT LEAST HER OUTLOOK ON IT, BECAUSE SHE WAS LIVING THE LIFE
SHE HAD CHOSEN AND IT WAS
COMPLETELY REROUTED. SHE FOUND THE SILVER LINING IN
ALL THIS.
&gt;&gt; THAT TAKES COURAGE AND STRENGTH.
THE FACT SHE WAS ABLE TO FIND
THAT IS AMAZING. &gt;&gt; GUY WALKS INTO A RESTAURANT.
REALLY NOT THAT FUNNY.
LEFT HIS CAR OUT FRONT, GOES INSIDE, BUT CAN HE AS THE VAN
BEGINS TO SLOWLY ROLL BACKWARDS,
HERE HE COMES. IT WAS A NICE MOVE.
HE DIDN'T PUT IT IN PARK.
&gt;&gt; DIDN'T SET THE HAND BRAKE. YOU SEE FROM THE OTHER CAMERA
ANGLE AS HE NOTICES IT FROM THE
INSIDE OF THE RESTAURANT. &gt;&gt; THIS GUY IS A LEGEND.
&gt;&gt; PRETTY -- SPEAKING OF
LEGENDS. HAVE A COUPLE LEGENDS HERE.
POLICE ARE CHASING AFTER THIS
BMW BECAUSE HE FILLED IT UP WITH GAS AND THEN JUST LEFT WITHOUT
PAYING FOR IT.
SO THEY ARE TRYING TO GET THIS CLOWN TO STOP HIS CAR AND PAY
FOR HIS GAS.
&gt;&gt; IRONICALLY HE'S FILLED UP WITH GAS, THIS COULD GO ON FOR
QUITE SOME TIME.
. THEY'VE TAKEN THAT INTO
CONSIDERATION.
STAYING CLOSE BY BUT THEY ARE NOT TRYING TO PULL ANY DRASTIC
MOVES YET, BUT THE POLICE, THEY
HAVE A PLAN. &gt;&gt; THEY SURE DO.
IT'S ONE WE HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE.
BY GOLLY IS IT EFFECTIVE. SURPRISE!
THAT'S CALLED A ROADBLOCK.
AND THE POLICE WERE COMING THE OTHER WAY AS THAT TRUCK
DRIVER -- DO A FAVOR, PULL IN
FRONT OF TRAFFIC. DOES EXACTLY THAT.
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME HE'S DONE
SOMETHING LIKE THIS. IN FACT, HE WAS ARRESTED AND
THEY BELIEVE HE DID THIS LAST
YEAR. &gt;&gt; TODAY IS BONUS DAY.
GIVING AWAY A FLAT SCREEN TV,
TOO. &gt;&gt; TWO WINNERS TODAY.
YOU'LL NEED WEDNESDAY'S BUZZ
WORD, BE AT LEAST 21 YEARS OLD AND A LEGAL U.S. OR CANADIAN
RESIDENT.
&gt;&gt; THE "RTM" BUZZ WORD COMING UP IN A BIT.
&gt;&gt; STAND BY, EVERYONE, FOR THE
"RTM" iPAD MINI GIVEAWAY.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; THERE ARE TIMES WHEN TIME IS
OF THE ESSENCE, ESPECIALLY WHEN
IT COMES TO RESCUING ANIMALS. IN THIS VIDEO FROM NORTHERN
IRELAND, THIS PAIR HERE DECIDED
THEY WERE GOING TO TAKE MATTERS INTO THEIR OWN HANDS AND SAVE
THIS STRANDED SEAL.
YOU CAN SEE THEY ARE PULLING IT TOWARD THE OCEAN USING SOME KIND
OF FABRIC, SOME KIND OF TIE THEY
MANAGED TO GET UNDER THE BELLY OF THE SEAL AND THEY ARE GLIDING
IT DOWN.
MAYBE IT WAS EXHAUSTED, MAYBE IT WASN'T MOVING, SEEMS TO BE A
VERY SMALL SEAL.
EITHER WAY, THEY FELT THAT IT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.
THE VIDEO'S GONE VIRAL.
ONCE THEY GET IT BACK CLOSE TO THE WATER YOU SEE THAT THE SEAL
ACTUALLY STARTS MOVING TOWARDS
THE OCEAN AND IT GOES BACK IN. &gt;&gt; FROM THAT RESCUE TO THIS ONE,
THESE KAYAKERS ARE OUT ON THIS
RIVER AND I DON'T KNOW HOW ON EARTH THEY WERE ABLE TO SPOT
THIS.
THEY COME UP ON THE SHEEP HERE THAT'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN STRANDED.
THEY SAY THE WATER WAS VERY COLD
AND THEY BELIEVE THAT THE SHEEP WAS GETTING CLOSE, IF NOT
ALREADY EXPERIENCING
HYPOTHERMIA. BEEN IN THERE FOR HOURS.
&gt;&gt; JUST KEEPING ITS HEAD ABOVE
WATER. PROBABLY CAN'T EVEN MOVE AT THIS
POINT.
&gt;&gt; THE GOOD THING IS, THEY ARE ABLE TO GRAB IT.
THEY SECURE IT RIGHT NEXT TO THE
KAYAK, AND THEN THEY ARE PULLING THAT POOR EXHAUSTED SHEEP ON TO
THE GROUND.
THEY WANTED TO WAIT FOR HELP, BUT REALIZED BECAUSE OF THE
SITUATION THEY FELT THEY NEEDED
TO ACT IN THAT MOMENT. YOU CAN TELL HOW CLEARLY
EXHAUSTED IT IS.
IT CANNOT GET UP. &gt;&gt; LET IT WARM UP, CATCH ITS
BREATH, IT WILL BE FINE.
&gt;&gt; NEEDS A SECOND.</description>

      <description>NOW BACK TO THE SHOW.
&gt;&gt;&gt; SKIING USUALLY REQUIRES
SOMETHING PRETTY ESSENTIAL. SKIS, SNOW.
HOWEVER, THEY HAVE DISCOVERED
IT'S NOT NECESSARY. &gt;&gt; I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS GOING
TO BE A SAND SKIING VIDEO.
&gt;&gt; IF YOU WERE THINKING DIFFICULT, YOU'D BE RIGHT.
&gt;&gt; THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER
DEVICES THAT YOU CAN USE TO SLIDE AROUND OR ROLL AROUND
WITH.
&gt;&gt; IF SKIING IS YOUR PRACTICE, HOW DO YOU PRACTICE?
TURNS OUT HE'S GOT SKILLS.
&gt;&gt; MAKING ALL THESE MANEUVERS. HE'S INCREDIBLE.
&gt;&gt; HE'S BUILDING MUSCLE MEMORY,
WHICH IS WHAT MATTERS. THEN HE HAS TO ADAPT TO THE SNOW
WHEN IT'S THERE.
&gt;&gt; NOT JUST BUILDING HIS SKILL SET.
HE'S LITERALLY BUILDING THIS
OBSTACLE COURSE. THIS WAS ALL PART OF KEVIN'S
SUMMER RAIL CHALLENGE.
IT'S THE SECOND YEAR HE'S DONE IT.
WHAT HE DOES IS OPENS IT UP,
THEY CAN SUBMIT A ONE OR TWO-MINUTE VIDEO AND ALL THE
SPONSORS HAVE DONATED REALLY
COOL STUFF. GIVEN AWAY SKIS, JACKETS,
GOGGLES, HOODIES, STUFF LIKE
THAT. IN FACT, YOU CAN SEE THE WINNING
VIDEOS RIGHT HERE.
THIS GUY IS AMAZING. LET'S PUT THE WHOLE THING UP ON
OUR WEBSITE,
RIGHTTHISMINUTE.COM. &gt;&gt; THIS IS A REVEAL VIDEO, BUT
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THE REVEAL
NOT BEING WHAT YOU EXPECT IT TO BE.
LIKE THIS LITTLE GIRL.
HERE SHE IS IN A PET STORE WITH MOM.
SHE'S OVER HERE LOOKING AT A
COUPLE OF THINGS AND MOM IS LIKE --
&gt;&gt; LOOK AT THIS CAGE.
&gt;&gt; AT THIS POINT THE GIRL THINKS SHE'S IN THE STORE TO GET A
BRAND NEW GUINEA PIG.
AND NOW THE TEARS. NIAGARA FALLS.
EVEN THE WOMAN CARRYING THE DOG
CRATE HAS TO COMFORT HER. &gt;&gt; YOU OKAY?
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S INSIDE,
A PUPPY. &gt;&gt; OH.
&gt;&gt; OH!
&gt;&gt; SO CUTE. &gt;&gt; DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE TEARS
NOW?
&gt;&gt; CUTE DOG. &gt;&gt; IT IS CUTE AND SHE STAYS IN
THIS POSITION AND CRIES FOR SOME
TIME. &gt;&gt; I HOPE SHE'S NOT ALLERGIC.
&gt;&gt; RIGHT?
&gt;&gt; SHE'S REALLY, REALLY HAPPY, BUT IN THIS NEXT VIDEO, I HAVE
THE BEST PUPPY SURPRISE YOU HAVE
EVER SEEN. THESE PEOPLE GOT A MINI GOLDEN
DOODLE.
WATCH AS DAUGHTER NUMBER ONE COMES OUT.
&gt;&gt; OH, PUPPY!
&gt;&gt; REALLY NOT THE BEST. NO, IT'S SISTER THAT'S ABOUT TO
COME OUT NEXT.
&gt;&gt; WHAT IS THIS? I HAVE TO SAY MY FAVORITE PUPPY
SURPRISE SO FAR IN "RIGHT THIS
MINUTE" HISTORY. &gt;&gt; WATCH THIS WAITER GET THE TIP
OF A LIFETIME.
&gt;&gt; QUITE THE STORY TO TELL.</description>

      <description>IT'S THE CURE FOR BOREDOM.
DOWNLOAD IT NOW.
&gt;&gt;&gt; SOCKS OVER SHOES. THIS TUTORIAL IS PUT TOGETHER BY
CARLIE BIBLE AND SHE USES HER
REGULAR PUMPS BUT ACTUALLY TAKES SOCKS, PUTS THEM OVER THE PUMPS,
AND CUTS A HOLE FOR THE HEEL AND
THAT'S HOW SHE'S MAKING THEM. &gt;&gt; THIS IS AN AFFORDABLE WAY IT
GET NEW BOOTS YOU KNOW ARE
COMFORTABLE ALREADY, YOU WORKED THEM IN.
&gt;&gt; IF YOU WANT TO TAKE THEM OUT
ON THE STREET SHE RECOMMENDS YOU PUT SOME OF THAT SAND PAPER TO
THE BOTTOM TO GIVE YOU GRIP.
&gt;&gt; THE ONES I'VE SEEN WERE MADE THAT WAY SO THE HEEL IS ALREADY
INTACT.
&gt;&gt; I LIKE THIS IDEA, ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE KIDS AND THEY WANT A
NEW BOOT.
LOOK, WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY FOR YOU TO HAVE BOOTS IN EVERY
COLOR, LET'S DO THIS.
&gt;&gt; POINT OF DIY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY THAT MONEY.
&gt;&gt; APPARENTLY A BUNCH OF
BLOGGERS ARE ALL ABOUT THIS TREND RIGHT NOW, WHERE THEY ARE
RECREATING THE KANYE WEST SOCK
BOOT. NOW YOU'RE GIVING IT YOUR OWN
FLAIR.
&gt;&gt; YES, THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO SPEND THE
MONEY.
&gt;&gt; ENTERTAINERS SAY THE SHOE IS FUN, IT'S THE PROMOTION THAT'S
THE WORK.
KEVIN HART IS OUT THERE HEAVILY PROMOTING HIS NEW FILM "WHAT
NOW," HUGE COMEDY SPECIAL.
HE'S WITH THE GUYS, THING IS, THEY HAVE A PRETTY UNIQUE WAY OF
INTERVIEWING PEOPLE.
AS YOU GO ALONG, IT GOES FROM HOT TO SERIOUSLY HOT, TO THE
SURFACE OF THE SUN.
HE'S GOING TO TRY ALL OF THEM? &gt;&gt; YES.
&gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
ENTERTAINMENT, WATCH KEVIN HART SUFFER, BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
MAN, DOES HE STICK WITH THE
INTERVIEW. &gt;&gt; WHAT NOW IS UNLIKE ANY
COMEDY.
&gt;&gt; AS THE MINUTES TICK AWAY, DOES GET A BIT TENSE.
&gt;&gt; CATCHING YOU?
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT'S HOT. &gt;&gt; EVENTUALLY STARTS GOING FOR
THE MILK.
&gt;&gt; MILK. &gt;&gt; HALFWAY DONE.
&gt;&gt; ASKING QUESTIONS, THOUGH,
HE'S HAVING TROUBLE. &gt;&gt; MY LIPS FEEL LIKE THEY ARE
BLEEDING.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON, MAN.
&gt;&gt; EVENTUALLY HE STARTS TAKING
OFF HALF HIS JACKET, TRYING TO FOCUS.
&gt;&gt; DOESN'T WANT TO DO IT, BUT
THE HOST DOES IT. &gt;&gt; YOU GO FIRST.
I'M GOING TO GUESS.
&gt;&gt; HE HAS TO DO IT. &gt;&gt; HE LOOKS LIKE HE'S HAD ONE
TOO MANY.
HE REALLY DOES. &gt;&gt; THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE DOES.
&gt;&gt; I'M DRUNK, I FEEL LIKE I'M
DRUNK. &gt;&gt; HILARIOUS VIDEO.
IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE WHOLE
THING, VERY FUNNY,</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt; GIVE ME SOME.
&gt;&gt;&gt; JUST NOT FEELING IT.
&gt;&gt; IN A HOSPITAL BED, HE JUST SURVIVED A LIFE THREATENING
CRASH LAST WEEK, BUT HE KEEPS
SAYING HE IS SO GLAD TO BE ALIVE, BECAUSE --
&gt;&gt; EXPECTING A BABY IN JUNE OF
NEXT YEAR. &gt;&gt; YEAH.
&gt;&gt; JUST THIS MORNING WE FOUND
OUT. &gt;&gt; WHILE HE IS IN THE HOSPITAL
BED HE'S ANNOUNCING TO FRIEND
AND FAMILY HE AND HIS GIRLFRIEND CHLOE ARE EXPECTING.
THE VIDEO HAS GONE VIRAL BECAUSE
SHE FOUND OUT AFTER HIS ACCIDENT SHE WAS PREGNANT AND HE JUST
FOUND OUT.
&gt;&gt; THE TIMING. NO WONDER HE'S FEELING PRETTY
GOOD.
&gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; I HAVE GOOD NEWS FOR YOU,
WE'RE EXPECTING A BABY.
&gt;&gt; OH, WOW. [ BLEEP ].
&gt;&gt; THAT'S SOME OF THE BEST
MEDICINE THIS GUY COULD HAVE GOTTEN.
&gt;&gt; ESPECIALLY SINCE HIS INJURIES
WERE INCREDIBLY SEVERE. WHEN THE ACCIDENT FIRST
HAPPENED, DOCTORS WEREN'T SURE
HE WOULD SURVIVE. HE HAS SPINAL INJURIES, BUT HE'S
COME OUT OF THE MEDICALLY
INDUCED COMA HE WAS IN. &gt;&gt; WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?
&gt;&gt; HE WAS INVOLVED IN A SERIOUS
CAR ACCIDENT AND HE WAS T-BONED. A 41-YEAR-OLD MAN HAS BEEN
ARRESTED, ACCORDING TO REPORTS,
ON SUSPICION OF WOUNDING WITH INTENT.
HE WAS RELEASED ON BAIL IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS INCIDENT. &gt;&gt; WITH INTENT, THAT'S WEIRD.
&gt;&gt; BUT THE GOOD THING IS, HE AND
CHLOE AND THEIR ENTIRE FAMILY HAVE SOMETHING PRETTY AMAZING TO
LOOK FORWARD TO.
&gt;&gt; OH, MY. &gt;&gt; EVERY DAY IS GOING TO BE
SPECIAL HE GETS TO SPEND WITH
HIS CHILD.</description>
