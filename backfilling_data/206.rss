      <description>ALL FOUR STALLING OUT INSIDE THE
BAYLOR 10. AND A GRAND TOTAL OF SIX POINTS
FOR ALL FOUR. &gt;&gt; Joey: THAT'S WHY I WOULD HAVE
KICKED A FIELD GOAL. &gt;&gt; Rece: TAKE A GUESS WHO SMITH
THREW HIS BALL TO. &gt;&gt; David: WELL, YOU'RE 20
YARDS -- LOOK AT RIGHT NOW, YOU HAVE A 12-YARD CUSHION.
&gt;&gt; Joey: YEAH. THAT'S REAL EASY.
&gt;&gt; David: AT SOME POINT, DON'T YOU HAVE TO COME UP, I KNOW
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT BEING BEATEN OVER THE TOP, DON'T YOU
HAVE TO MAKE THEM DO IT? &gt;&gt; Joey: TRYING TO DEFEND WITH
THE INSIDE LINEBACKER TO STOP THE THROW.
I'M FINE WITH LEAVING THE CORNER BACK.
IT'S BIG PLAYS THAT HAVE HURT THE BOISE STATE DEFENSE.
WHEN THEY MAKE THAT THROW, YOU MUST MAKE A PLAY ON IT.
&gt;&gt; Rece: LEE MADE THAT TACKLE. HIT IMMEDIATELY, SPUN AWAY.
HORTON MADE CONTACT, AND HAD A CHANCE TO STOP THEM SHORT OF A
FIRST DOWN. BUT ZAMORA, A GREAT SPIN MOVE.
&gt;&gt; David: HE WAS STOPPED 100%, USING HIS BIG, STRONG BODY.
&gt;&gt; Joey: WHEN THIS COMES, YOU NEED TO MAKE A PLAY.
&gt;&gt; Rece: SMITH. NOW, TO THE SIDE, AND FINALLY
KNOCKED DOWN. WEAVER MAKES THE STOP.
I'M NOT SURE THAT SMITH COULD HAVE THROWN THAT BALL.
I'M NOT SURE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LEGAL, ALMOST LOOKED LIKE IT
CROSSED THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. &gt;&gt; Joey: JUST GET SOME POSITIVE
YARDS AND GET DOWN. SCRAMBLING IS NOT HIS FORTE.
EARLIER, HE STAYED ALIVE AND COMPLETED A BALL.
BUT HE'S NOT GOING TO SCRAMBLE AND KILL YOU.
GET AS MUCH POSITIVE YARDS AS POSSIBLE.
&gt;&gt; Rece: WILLIAMS. 12 CARRIES, 47 YARDS.
JUST A SHADE UNDER FOUR YARDS PER CARRY.
ABOUT WHAT HE GETS THERE TO CONVERT ON THIRD DOWN.
THIS FEELS LIKE, ESPECIALLY AFTER THE STOP ON FOURTH DOWN,
AND A DRIVE WHERE THE BRONCOS DEFENSE NEEDS TO GET A STOP.
INSTEAD, ANOTHER COMPLETION TO THE OUTSIDE, RIGHT AT MIDFIELD,
CANNON AGAIN. &gt;&gt; Joey: THIS SETS UP SECOND AND
THIRD DOWN TO DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.
YOU ONLY NEED TWO YARDS, AND IT OPENS UP YOUR PLAYBOOK.
&gt;&gt; Rece: CANNON, WHAT A PERFORMANCE FROM HIM.
AS A TRUE FRESHMAN, A HUGE GAME AGAINST MICHIGAN STATE.
EIGHT CATCHES FOR 197 YARDS, AND A COUPLE TOUCHDOWNS.
NOW, THIS IS HIS SECOND BEST BOWL PERFORMANCE.
&gt;&gt; Joey: WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH CANNON, KEEP THE CAMERA
TIGHT ON HIM. &gt;&gt; David: SHOW HIM A DIFFERENT
LOOK. YOU HAVE A TRUE FRESHMAN
QUARTERBACK. YOU NEED TO SHOW HIM DIFFERENT
LOOKS. BRING SOME BLITZES, TAKE SOME
CHANCES TO KEEP HIM OFF-BALANCE. WHEN HE IS GETTING PRESSURE, HIS
COMPLETION PERCENTAGE IS LIKE 40%.
ONE OF THE WORST IN COLLEGE FOOTBALL.
&gt;&gt; Rece: A LITTLE PRESSURE. WILLIAMS, A PICKUP OF A FEW TO
BRING UP THIRD DOWN. WHITLOCK STOPS IT.
&gt;&gt; David: FRESHMEN DON'T KNOW THEIR ANSWERS.
ONCE THAT FIRST OPTION GETS TAKEN AWAY, FRESHMEN A LOT OF
TIMES GO DOWN. HE DOES THAT A LOT, STRUGGLES TO
GO TO OTHER RECEIVERS. BUT BRING SOME PRESSURE.
&gt;&gt; Rece: BOISE STATE OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR ANDY AVALOS SAID HE
WANTS TO MAKE IT EASY TO EXECUTE.
&gt;&gt; Referee: FIVE-YARD PENALTY. THIRD DOWN.
&gt;&gt; David: THAT WILL GET YOU. &gt;&gt; Rece: A MISTAKE THAT TURNS
THIRD AND MEDIUM TO THIRD AND SHORT.
THAT MOVES THE BALL INSIDE THE 40.
BAYLOR NEEDS TO GET A YARD. TO KEEP THIS DRIVE GOING.
MAYBE THEY HAVE TWO CHANCES TO DO IT.
ONLY NEED ONE. WILLIAMS, SURGING AHEAD, PICKING
UP THE FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; Joey: TOUGH TO STOP A
ONE-YARD RUN WITH THREE DEFENSIVE LINEMEN.
I AGREE WITH DAVID, YOU NEED TO START BRINGING THE HEAT.
&gt;&gt; Rece: ANOTHER FLAG DOWN. &gt;&gt; Referee: AFTER THE PLAY,
UNSPORTSMANLIKE CONDUCT, NUMBER 58 OF THE OFFENSE.
FIRST AND TEN. &gt;&gt; David: THAT'S HARD TO SWALLOW
AS A COACH, YOU'RE DOING WHAT YOU WANT, AND HAVING SO MUCH
SUCCESS, NOW YOU'RE GOING TO GET YOURSELF AT FIRST AND 25.
THIS IS BOISE'S CHANCE. A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.
NOW YOU CAN PLAY A LITTLE BIT MORE CONSERVATIVE, IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO. JUST GET A PUNT, GET THE BALL
BACK, AND GET SOME POINTS ON THE BOARD.
&gt;&gt; Rece: NOT SURE IF WILSON DID SOMETHING OR SAID SOMETHING.
BUT WHATEVER IT WAS, IT MOVES THE CHAINS BACK.
AND THEY HAVE MOVED THE MARKERS BACK, TOO.
SO THEY LOST THE YARDAGE. BUT STILL A FIRST AND TEN.
&gt;&gt; David: STILL BACKS THEM UP. &gt;&gt; Rece: FOR SURE.
MOVING BACK INTO THEIR OWN TERRITORY.
BUT BOISE, CHANGING THEIR DEFENSE.
AND ADJUSTING. WILLIAMS.
THROWS IT, COMPLETE INSIDE THE 30 YARD LINE.
BAYLOR CONTINUES TO KEEP IT MOVING.
THAT WAS STRICKLAND, THE REDSHIRT FRESHMAN, QUESTIONABLE
COMING INTO THE GAME WITH A LEG INJURY.
&gt;&gt; David: HOW ABOUT THAT PASS? TALK ABOUT GETTING PRESSURE AND
THROWING A STRIKE. &gt;&gt; Rece: NOW, PLATT HAS IT ALONG
THE SIDELINES, AND SHOVED OUT OF BOUNDS.
THE BRONCOS ARE REELING ON DEFENSE.
&gt;&gt; Joey: GIVES PRESSURE, THROWS IT ACROSS HIS BODY.
THAT'S BIG-TIME. &gt;&gt; Rece: TO THE OUTSIDE, CANNON
HAS A LITTLE HELP OUT THERE, BUT IT CLOSES QUICKLY.
NOT MUCH RUNNING ROOM THIS TIME. FORD WAS THERE FOR THE BRONCOS.
&gt;&gt; Joey: ANOTHER THIRD DOWN FOR THE BOISE STATE DEFENSE, THIRD
AND SHORT. THEY'VE STRUGGLED WITH THE
THREE-FOUR DEFENSE TO STOP THE ONE-YARD RUNS BY BAYLOR.
LET'S SEE IF THEY CAN DO IT AGAIN.
&gt;&gt; Rece: CUTS IT BACK NICELY. WILLIAMS MADE A NIFTY MOVE, AND
IT'S ANOTHER FIRST DOWN FOR BAYLOR.
&gt;&gt; David: THEY'RE NOT SUBSTITUTING, SO YOU CAN'T
SUBSTITUTE. THIRD AND SHORT, MY POINT IS,
IT'S BEEN A STRUGGLE ALL NIGHT. YOU SAID LET'S BRING THE HEAT.
LET'S GO TO A FOUR-THREE DEFENSE, TO GET THE DEFENSIVE
LINEMEN INTO THE GAME, STOP THE THIRD AND ONES.
THEY HAVEN'T EVEN COME CLOSE YET.
&gt;&gt; Rece: THE HANDOFF. A WIDE RECEIVER BY TRADE, THEY
MOVE HIM AROUND A LITTLE BIT. GIVE HIM THE BALL.
NOT MUCH THAT TIME, HE LOST A YARD.
THIS TIME, UNDER CENTER, AND THE TIGHT END CAN'T HOLD ON TO IT.
McCASKILL WAS GIVING HIM A LITTLE HEAT.
&gt;&gt; David: HE'S A BLOCKER, MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT.
&gt;&gt; Joey: HE HAD IT. &gt;&gt; David: THE MATCHUP BETWEEN
HIM AND A CORNER, TO GET INTO THE END ZONE.
&gt;&gt; Rece: THIRD AND TEN. &gt;&gt; David: NOW, THERE'S LESS
SPACE ON THE FIELD. THIS HELPS THEM.
&gt;&gt; Rece: FIRING, JUST OFF THE HANDS OF CANNON.
FORD ON THE COVERAGE. &gt;&gt; David: WHAT A THROW, FROM THE
POCKET. FEET SET, ON TIME, ON THE MONEY.
&gt;&gt; Joey: IT'S EASIER ON DEFENSE WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE AS MUCH
GROUND TO COVER. GREAT COVERAGE.
THAT WAS A HECK OF A JOB BY FORD.
GETTING A STOP. &gt;&gt; Rece: CHRIS CALLAHAN, TRYING
TO TACK A FIELD GOAL ON FOR BAYLOR.
A 34-YARD ATTEMPT. CALLAHAN'S BOOT IS ON THE WAY,
AND IT'S TRUE. AND THERE IS A FLAG.
FLAG FLEW IN THERE, LET'S STOP THE MUSIC.
RECUE THE MUSIC. &gt;&gt; David: WE DIDN'T GET ANOTHER
ROUGHING THE KICKER, DID WE? DON'T MAKE ME GO DOWN THERE.
&gt;&gt; Rece: THIS IS YOUR BASIC 20-PLAY DRIVE, STARTED AT THE 5.
&gt;&gt; Referee: FIELD GOAL IS GOOD. AFTER THE PLAY, UNNECESSARY
ROUGHNESS, NUMBER 64. TIME-OUT.
&gt;&gt; Rece: THAT ONE, COMING FROM DESOUZA.
SECOND TIME TONIGHT, BAYLOR WILL KICK OFF FROM THE 20, MUCH TO
THE DISMAY OF JIM GROBE.</description>

      <description>          [SFX: Bong] &gt;&gt; Rece: SOME OF THE BAYLOR
PLAYERS, VISITING WITH FOLKS, SERVING SOME MEALS DURING THEIR
TIME IN PHOENIX AT THE MOTEL 6 CACTUS BOWL.
THE BEARS HAVE COME TO PLAY. FINISHING OFF A 21-PLAY DRIVE,
ENDING IN A FIELD GOAL. THE LAST TWO SCORING DRIVES
COVERED 36 PLAYS. THIS IS UNUSUAL FOR THE TWO
TEAMS, THE WAY THEY'VE CONTROLLED THE BALL, CHEWING THE
CLOCK. SECOND TIME THAT THE BEARS END
UP WITH A PENALTY THAT RESULTS IN THEM KICKING OFF FROM THE 20.
SO, BOISE STATE, 3:18 TO GO IN THE THIRD QUARTER, DOWN BY 18.
NEED TO GET BUSY. WILSON.
WILSON, LUCKY HE DIDN'T GET TAKEN OUT BY HIS OWN MAN.
UP TO THE 31 YARD LINE. THE BRONCOS, YET TO FIND THE END
ZONE. THEY'LL PUT TOGETHER A DRIVE
WHEN YOU COME BACK.     THIS JUST IN. 50 MILLION
    CUSTOMERS' DATA WAS NOT COMPROMISED THIS MORNING       IN A SECURITY BREACH
      THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.   WALL STREET, NOT RATTLED...
  AT ALL!                         NO.    SIR, SIR. WHAT WENT RIGHT?           EVERYTHING.    WE HAVE A BRIEF STATEMENT
   ON THIS NON-BREACH.    WE'RE HAPPY TO REPORT
   THERE'S NOTHING TO REPORT.     MY DAD'S COMPANY WASN'T
    HACKED TODAY.                    COOL.</description>

      <description>    THIS JUST IN. 50 MILLION
    CUSTOMERS' DATA WAS NOT COMPROMISED THIS MORNING       IN A SECURITY BREACH
      THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.   WALL STREET, NOT RATTLED...
  AT ALL!                         NO.    SIR, SIR. WHAT WENT RIGHT?           EVERYTHING.    WE HAVE A BRIEF STATEMENT
   ON THIS NON-BREACH.    WE'RE HAPPY TO REPORT
   THERE'S NOTHING TO REPORT.     MY DAD'S COMPANY WASN'T
    HACKED TODAY.                    COOL. &gt;&gt;&gt; AND THE BRONCOS HAVE WON THE
FIESTA BOWL! &gt;&gt; IT'S INTERCEPTED BY VENABLES!
THAT WILL SEAL IT FOR THE BRONCOS.
&gt;&gt; SOLOMON CAN'T GET TACKLED IN THE FIELD OF PLAY, AND HE DOES!
MAGIC AT THE FIESTA BOWL! &gt;&gt; THE THREE BOISE STATE
VICTORIES IN THE FIESTA BOWL, ALL DESERT MAGIC.
THEY'RE 3-0 IN THESE MEMORABLE VICTORIES, INCLUDING THE ONE
AGAINST OKLAHOMA TEN YEARS AGO. AND THEY COULD USE A LITTLE
DESERT MAGIC, BECAUSE BAYLOR IS RUNNING THE THROW.
THIS ONE, OUT TO ABOUT THE 36. SPERBECK, HOBBLING A LITTLE BIT
IN HIS FINAL GAME AS A BRONCO. &gt;&gt; Joey: THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO DRAG HIM OFF THE FIELD,  &gt;&gt; Rece: NO QUESTION.
HERE COME THE FLAGS AGAIN, AS WE --
&gt;&gt; Joey: THAT'S REID, I THINK, NUMBER 9.
WHAT A STUPID -- HE RAN 20 YARDS TO COME PUSH A GUY.
GOOD ACTING. &gt;&gt; Rece: BLANCHARD.
&gt;&gt; Joey: JUST STUPID IN FRONT OF THE OFFICIAL.
&gt;&gt; Referee: AFTER THE PLAY, UKE CONDUCT, NUMBER
9 OF THE DEFENSE. FUNSPORTSMANLIKE FOUL FOR
NUMBER 9 IN THE GAME. &gt;&gt; Rece: THIS IS THE KIND OF
THING THAT'S BEEN FRUSTRATING THIS YEAR FOR BAYLOR.
DOING SOME THINGS THAT AREN'T SMART.
THERE'S THE TACKLE. &gt;&gt; David: HECK OF A JOB BY YOUNG
AND THE "D"-LINE UP FRONT. THAT WAS NOT THE PERSONAL FOUL.
AND NOW, A FIRST DOWN TO BOISE STATE.
&gt;&gt; Rece: BAYLOR PICKING UP ITS FOURTH UNSPORTSMANLIKE PENALTY.
THEY'RE IN CONTROL IN THE GAME, LATE IN THE THIRD QUARTER.
THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO DO, DO ANYTHING TO GIVE THE OTHER
TEAM A SPARK. RYPIEN FIRING, SPERBECK IS OUT
THERE. CAN'T CONNECT, THAT'S BECAUSE
BLANCHARD GAVE RYPIEN ONE RIGHT IN THE BREAD BASKET.
&gt;&gt; David: JUST OUTSIDE THE FINGERTIPS.
AND BAYLOR HASN'T BLITZED MUCH TONIGHT, THEY HAVEN'T HAD TO.
THEY'VE DONE A NICE JOB OF PLAYING NICE UP FRONT WITH THE
FRONT FOUR. THEY FINALLY BLITZED.
BISE HAD THEIR CHANCE, AND THEY MISSED IT.
&gt;&gt; Rece: ROH, WITH A FIRST DOWN. MOVING THE BALL REALLY HASN'T
BEEN THE PROBLEM FOR BOISE STATE.
FINISHING THE DRIVE, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAS BEEN A HUGE
PROBLEM. RYPIEN.
SHORT GAIN. LOOKING FOR THE BIG FELLA, THE
TIGHT END. THAT ONE, BLAKELY MAKING THE
CATCH. &gt;&gt; Joey: IF YOU'RE BAYLOR,
YOU'LL GIVE UP THE THREE-YARD PASS ALL NIGHT LONG.
THIS BOISE STATE OFFENSE WANTS TO RUN THE BALL, GO DOWN DEEP.
AND BAYLOR'S DEFENSE HAS DONE A TERRIFIC JOB OF FORCING RYPIEN
TO THROW UNDERNEATH, FOR THE SHORTER PASSES.
&gt;&gt; Rece: RYPIEN, LOOKING AT SECOND AND EIGHT.
AND HE RUNS OUT OF TIME. THOUGHT HE HAD SOME TIME, BUT
SMITH SHOWED UP AND PLOWED UP RYPIEN.
&gt;&gt; David: HE'S THE BEST PLAYER ON THE BAYLOR "D."
GOOD AGAINST THE RUN, GOOD AGAINST THE PASS.
THE BEST PLAYER ON THAT BAYLOR DEFENSE.
&gt;&gt; Rece: FINAL MINUTE OF THE THIRD QUARTER.
NOW THIRD DOWN AND 16. &gt;&gt; David: RYPIEN HAD TO BE
THINKING, THEY'RE RUSHING "D." NOW, THE NICKEL IS UNDERNEATH.
THEY GOT SIX OF THE 16 THEY NEEDED.
NOW, FOURTH DOWN AND TEN. PROBABLY OUT OF FIELD GOAL
RANGE. THE LONG THIS YEAR IS 46.
THIS WOULD BE 52. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO KICK A FIELD
GOAL EARLIER, WHEN GALLOWAY WANTED THEM TO.
SO CERTAINLY NOT NOW. SEE WHAT THEY CAN FIGURE OUT FOR
THIRD DOWN, AS THE FINAL SECONDS ARE TICKING OFF IN THE THIRD
QUARTER. THEY'LL HAVE A LITTLE MORE TIME
TO THINK ABOUT IT BETWEEN QUARTERS.
HEY, LOOK, YOU DON'T WANT TO COUNT OUT BOISE STATE.
BUT THIS FEELS LIKE THE PLAY THEY HAVE TO MAKE WITH THE
FOURTH QUARTER COMING. IN THE MOTEL 6 CACTUS BOWL.                âª And it feels
                 so good âª           âª Oh yeah âª                     âª  âª     ANTHONY DAVIS IS ONE
OF THE TOP BLOCKERS IN THE NBA     SO HE WAS A PERFECT FIT
    FOR THE IT DEPARTMENT.           (BUZZER)
     "BLOCKED - BLOCKED"           ANTHONY...       IT'S JUST MY BLOG.          IS YOUR BLOG
       BUSINESS RELATED? (NO.)          THERE YOU GO.       CAN'T STOP ME FROM
        USING MY PHONE.            (BUZZER)
      "BLOCKED - BLOCKED"       NOTHING GETS PAST
           THAT GUY.    I CAN STILL PLAY
     SOLITAIRE...                (NO YOU CAN'T!)            (BUZZER)

 "BLOCKED - BLOCKED - BLOCKED" WHY YOU DEFENDERS COVER SPACE IN
YOUR ZONE LIKE, I MEAN, BAYLOR HAD GUYS BACK THERE.
THEY JUST DON'T COVER THE GUY. &gt;&gt; David: I LIKE HOW YOU SAID
YOU GUYS. &gt;&gt; Rece: ANOTHER FLAG DOWN.
&gt;&gt; Referee: NO FOUL ON THE PLAY. RESULT IS A FIRST DOWN, BOISE
STATE. &gt;&gt; Joey: EXPLAIN THAT TO ME.
TURN AROUND AND COVER THE CURL. &gt;&gt; David: I GET IT.
BUT YOU HAVE A LOT OF GUYS TRYING TO COVER THE BALL AND
MAKE A PLAY. IN A TIGHT WINDOW, THIS IS
SOMETHING THAT RYPIEN HAS STRUGGLED ON.
OIL RYPIEN. HE HAD A CHANCE WITH SPERBECK TO
HAVE A NICE PICKUP. BUT DIDN'T CONNECT.
&gt;&gt; Joey: AND THE ZONE, THEY'RE RUSHING THREE, EIGHT IN
COVERAGE. SEE WHAT I MEAN?
THERE'S A CURL, AND THE LINEBACKER TURN AROUND, LOOK UP
THE CURL, AND COVER IT. &gt;&gt; David: SHOULD HAVE BEEN EDWARDS, NUMBER 20.
WHEN THE QUARTERBACK LOOKS OVER, HE SHOULD BE SHIFTING HIS EYES.
BUT A HECK OF A THROW. &gt;&gt; Rece: RYPIEN.
McNICHOLS, GREETED IN THE BACKFIELD.
THEY HAVEN'T LET McNICHOLS GET STARTED ALL NIGHT.
&gt;&gt; Joey: I DON'T KNOW IF I'VE EVER SAID THIS ABOUT BAYLOR'S
DEFENSE, BUT IF YOU'RE MATT RHULE, YOU'RE EXCITED ABOUT THE
WAY THE DEFENSE HAS PLAYED TONIGHT.
THERE HAVE BEEN PENALTIES AND ISSUES, BUT THE DEFENSIVE SIDE
OF BAYLOR HAS BEEN REALLY GOOD TONIGHT.
&gt;&gt; Rece: PLENTY OF TIME FOR RYPIEN.
HE'S GOING TO SCRAMBLE, GETS INSIDE THE 20.
BALL COMES LOOSE. HAVEN'T HEARD A WHISTLE.
AND STEWART HAS IT. STEWART, FINALLY UPENDED, JUST
ACROSS THE 25. AND ORION STEWART, NOW, COMING
UP WITH THE LOOSE FOOTBALL. THE THIRD TURNOVER OF THE NIGHT
FOR BOISE STATE. &gt;&gt; Joey: I THOUGHT HE WAS CLOSE
TO BEING DOWN. BUT NO.
&gt;&gt; David: GREAT PLAY. GREAT HUSTLE TO GET DOWN THE
FIELD. AND THEN THE AWARENESS TO RIP
THAT THING OUT. WATCH HIM.
&gt;&gt; Rece: THAT'S ROBERTS THAT GOT IT, NUMBER 52 COMING IN.
&gt;&gt; David: THAT'S AWESOME. WAS ANY PART OF HIM DOWN?
ELBOW THERE, OTHER LEG? &gt;&gt; Joey: LOOKED LIKE THE BALL
WAS ALREADY MOVING. DIDN'T MATTER AT THAT POINT.
&gt;&gt; Rece: ANOTHER TURNOVER. &gt;&gt; David: THERE YOU GO, THE
BAYLOR "D" TALKING ABOUT THREE FORCED TURNOVERS.
&gt;&gt; Rece: COMING INTO THE GAME MINUS-SEVEN ON TURNOVERS, SAME
AS BOISE STATE. TONIGHT, BAYLOR HAS BEEN
PLUS-TWO, AND THAT'S BEEN THE STORY OF THE GAME, THAT
DIFFERENCE. &gt;&gt; Joey: I'VE BEEN HARD ON BIG
12 DEFENSE AND BAYLOR PLAYING NO DEFENSE AS ANYBODY.
AND WE WERE TALKING TO MATT RHULE, NOBODY PLAYS DEFENSE IN
THE BIG 12. BUT THIS IS A BIG FEATHER IN THE
CAP OF BAYLOR'S DEFENSE, SHUTTING DOWN BOISE STATE.
THEY WERE ABLE TO MOVE THE BALL, BUT HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FINISH.
THAT'S WHAT MATTERS, IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MANY YARDS YOU GIVE
UP, YOU LOOK AT THE SCOREBOARD AND SEE THAT WE'VE ONLY GIVEN UP
SIX POINTS.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; WELCOME TO SPORTS NATION.
OUR MUST SEE MOMENT OF THE SEASON IS KENDALL WRIGHT, LAYING
OUT FOR THE CATCH AND TOUCHDOWN. HAPPY NEW YEAR.
&gt;&gt; FUN FIRST HALF. DETROIT AND DALLAS, TIED AT 21.
ADAM SCHEFTER, HAPPY HOLIDAYS TO YOU.
&gt;&gt; HAPPY HOLIDAYS TO YOU, TOO. &gt;&gt; AND CARR, BROKEN LEG.
WHAT DO WE KNOW? &gt;&gt; HE'S GOING TO HAVE SURGERY
TOMORROW IN LOS ANGELES. THE MINIMUM RECOVERY TIME, 6 TO
8 WEEKS. WHICH MEANS HE WILL NOT PLAY
AGAIN THIS SEASON. IT WILL BE McGLOIN'S JOB NOW.
CARR SHOULD BE BACK FOR THE OFF-SEASON PROGRAM, A SMALL
CONSOLATION TO RAIDERS FANS AT THAT TIME.
&gt;&gt; TOUGH TO WATCH. McGLOIN, WE WISH HIM LUCK, HE
HAS A GOOD TEAM. MARIOTA, BREAKING HIS LEG AS
WELL. EVERYTHING GOOD?
&gt;&gt; WELL, HIS SURGERY IS WEDNESDAY.
HE'S GOING TO HAVE A PLATE PUT INTO HIS LEG, GOING TO BE OUT
FOUR TO FIVE MONTHS. THE TENNESSEE TITANS IN THE SPAN
OF ONE AFTERNOON, LOST THE GAME, DIVISION TITLE, AND LOST THEIR
QUARTERBACK INTO THE START OF THE OFF-SEASON PROGRAM.
AND OTHER QUARTERBACK NEWS, RYAN TANNEHILL, THE DOLPHINS STILL
DON'T KNOW IF HE WILL PLAY IN THE PLAYOFFS.
AND ROETHLISBERGER, COULD MISS SUNDAY'S GAME.
AND TOM SAVAGE WILL REMAIN THE TEXANS' STARTER THROUGH WEEK 17.
&gt;&gt; WE HAD FUN, IT'S BEEN GREAT ON "MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL."
HOPEFULLY YOU ENJOYED IT. WE GOT A GOOD 30 MINUTES TO
COME. HAPPY HOLIDAYS.
LOOK, WHO'S THE SHARP-DRESSED MAN, ZACH ZENNER.
A COUPLE OF TOUCHDOWNS FOR DETROIT.
IF THEY WIN, THEY'RE IN THE PLAYOFFS.

      <description> A USED CAR,           TRUCK, SUV.          THAT'S SMART.        TRUECAR CAN HELP.      IT'S GREAT
     FOR FINDING A NEW CAR,    BUT YOU ALREADY KNEW THAT.   IT'S ALSO GREAT FOR FINDING
  THE PERFECT USED CAR.         YOU'LL SEE WHAT
        A FAIR PRICE IS,   AND YOU CAN CONNECT WITH
  A TRUECAR CERTIFIED DEALER.      SO, NO MATTER WHAT
     YOU'RE LOOKING FOR...           THERE IT IS.      THIS IS HOW BUYING
     A USED CAR SHOULD BE.         THIS IS TRUECAR.                                âª âª
âªâª &gt;&gt; Sean: THE DETROIT LIONS WIN
TONIGHT, THEY'RE IN THE PLAYOFFS.
TIED WITH THE NUMBER ONE SEED IN THE NFC IN THE UPCOMING
PLAYOFFS, THE DALLAS COWBOYS. FROM ARLINGTON, TEXAS, SEAN
McDONOUGH AND JON GRUDEN. DELIGHTED TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
AND THE GOOD NEWS FOR MATTHEW STAFFORD, THERE'S A LITTLE BIT
OF A RUNNING GAME. &gt;&gt; Jon: IT ALWAYS HELPS.
AND THE COWBOYS' SEED IS ALL SET.
I ADMIRE THE WAY THEY CAME OUT AND PLAYED THEIR STARTERS.
BUT IT'S ALL GOING TO COME DOWN TO STAFFORD AND HIS GUN
SLINGING. IT'S GOING TO BE AN EXCITING
FINISH. &gt;&gt; Sean: SHOULD BE A TERRIFIC
SECOND HALF. STAFFORD HOPING HE WON'T NEED
FOURTH-QUARTER HEROICS. THEY'VE WON NINE GAMES THIS
YEAR, EIGHT OF THEM, COMING FROM BEHIND TO WIN IN THE FOURTH QUARTER.
THAT'S AN NFL RECORD. AND YOU KIND OF START TO BELIEVE
IT'S YOUR SEASON, WE'RE GOING TO BE A PLAYOFF TEAM.
&gt;&gt; Jon: THEY ALL BELIEVE IN THEIR QUARTERBACK, PRATER HAS
HIT SOME GAME-WINNERS. THEY ENJOY CRUNCH TIME.
IT'S A CREDIT TO COACH CALDWELL. BUT CAN THEY HOLD OFF THE DALLAS
COWBOYS AND EARN A TRIP TO THE PLAYOFFS?
&gt;&gt; Sean: DETROIT WILL GET THE BALL FIRST TO BEGIN THE SECOND
HALF. ROBERTS, WHO WAS NOT OUT THERE
FOR A COUPLE OF KICKOFF AND PUNT RETURNS LATE IN THE FIRST HALF,
IS ON THE FIELD NOW FOR DETROIT. BAILEY WILL KICK OFF.
VERY EVEN FIRST HALF. DALLAS, 214 TOTAL YARDS.
192 FOR DETROIT. AND A BOMB BY BAILEY.
TOUCHBACK OUT TO THE 25. HERE'S LISA SALTERS.
&gt;&gt; Lisa: I ASKED JASON GARRETT WHY THE LIONS WERE ABLE TO BE
SUCCESSFUL RUNNING THE BALL AGAINST THE BEST RUSHING DEFENSE
IN THE LEAGUE. HE SAID, THERE'S NO EXCUSE, BUT
WE HAVE A LOT OF GUYS BANGED-UP ON THE DEFENSIVE LINE.
DAVIS IS OUT WITH A KNEE INJURY. McCLAIN IS OUT WITH AN ANKLE
INJURY. GARRETT SAID HE DIDN'T THINK
EITHER ONE WOULD RETURN. AND GREGORY SUFFERED AN OBLIQUE
STRAIN, BUT HE'LL TRY TO RETURN. GARRETT SAID THEY'RE DOWN TO
JUST FIVE DEFENSIVE LINEMEN. &gt;&gt; Sean: WILCOX, HE HAS A
REPUTATION OF BEING THE COWBOYS' BIGGEST HITTER, AND HE LIVED UP
TO IT WITH THAT HIT. &gt;&gt; Jon: HE FILLS THE LANE.
THAT'S AN OLD-SCHOOL SAFETY HIT. 27, WILCOX.
LOWERS THE BOOM. &gt;&gt; Sean: IN HIS FOURTH YEAR OUT
OF GEORGIA SOUTHERN. THREE RECEIVERS NOW.
ZENNER ON THE LEFT OF STAFFORD. THROW IS SHORT, OVER THE MIDDLE.
EBRON. GOT EIGHT, TO THE 34 YARD LINE.
HITCHENS LED THE WAY. &gt;&gt; Jon: STAFFORD SHOWING GOOD
MOBILITY IN THE POCKET, BIG THIRD-DOWN CONVERSION.
AND SOME OF THE AWKWARD DELIVERY SLOWS TO KEEP DRIVES ALIVE, YOU
FORGET ABOUT IT. THIRD DOWN AND SHORT.
LIONS STRUGGLE IN SHORT-YARDAGE SITUATIONS.
&gt;&gt; Sean: FIRST DOWN. BOLDIN, SHOVED OUT OF BOUNDS AT
THE 39 YARD LINE BY JONES. &gt;&gt; Jon: GOOD PLAY DESIGN.
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE JONES, LEFT SIDE OF YOUR SCREEN, PICK OFF
THE DEFENDER, AND IT'S FIRST DOWN FOR THE LIONS.
&gt;&gt; Sean: A MILESTONE FOR BOLDIN. WE'LL TELL YOU ABOUT IT IN A
MOMENT. HIS THIRD CATCH OF THE NIGHT.
1,070 FOR HIS CAREER. THEY HAVE THAT STRAIGHT, HERE
COMES A LATE BLITZ. JONES, THE STOP.
STAFFORD THROWS A BOW, INCOMPLETE TO TATE.
THOUGHT HE WAS BEING HELD. THERE'S A FLAG DOWN.
SCANDRICK HAD THE COVERAGE. &gt;&gt; Jon: GOING TO BE HOLDING.
&gt;&gt; Referee: HOLDING, 34 OF THE OFFENSE.
TEN-YARD PENALTY. FIRST DOWN.
&gt;&gt; Sean: WE MENTIONED THE MILESTONE FOR BOLDEN, 1,070
CATCHES NOW, TIED FOR NINTH ALL-TIME, MOST RECEPTIONS IN NFL
HISTORY. ONLY EIGHT AWAY FROM OWENS IN
THE EIGHT-SPOT. &gt;&gt; Jon: HERE COMES A BLITZ.
&gt;&gt; Sean: STAFFORD. AGAINST THE THREE-MAN RUSH,
COLLINS GOT HIM BACK INSIDE THE 20 YARD LINE.
A HOLDING PENALTY, AND NOW A DALLAS SACK.
&gt;&gt; Jon: THEY SHOWED THE BLITZ, AND BLUFF IT.
NUMBER 96, COLLINS. ON A MISTAKE BY THE LION
OFFENSIVE LINE. HUNTS MATTHEW STAFFORD.
DALLAS HAS COME OUT WITH AN AGGRESSIVE GAME LAN TO START
THE THIRD QUARTER. &gt;&gt; Sean: PLAY CLOCK AT TWO.
BLUFF ANOTHER BLITZ, STAFFORD PULLS UP JUST SHY OF THE LINE,
AND IT'S AN INTERCEPTION! RICOCHETED INTO THE ARMS OF J.J.
WILCOX. &gt;&gt; Jon: TRYING TO DO TOO MUCH.
THAT TIME, STAFFORD, TO HIS LEFT, MAKES A CRITICAL ERROR
UNDER FIRE. &gt;&gt; Sean: OFF THE HANDS OF CARR.
INTO THE HANDS OF WILCOX, FIRST TURNOVER OF THE GAME FOR EITHER
TEAM. ONE OF THE REASONS WHY DETROIT
IS IN POSITION TO MAKE THE PLAYOFFS, THEY HAVE MINIMIZED
THE TURNOVERS. JUST THEIR 13th OF THE SEASON.
FIFTH FEWEST IN THE NFL. &gt;&gt; Jon: GREAT TIME TO TAKE A
SHOT, AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN. BADEMOSI VERSUS BRYANT.
DON'T BE SURPRISED. &gt;&gt; Sean: EZEKIEL ELLIOTT.
OFF RIGHT GUARD. LAUNCHED BACK AFTER A SHORT
GAIN. ROBINSON TO THE BOTTOM OF THE
PILE WITH WILSON UP TOP. HARD TO BELIEVE, ONLY ONE DALLAS
COWBOY HAS EVER BEEN THE MVP OF THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE.
EMMITT SMITH, AND NOW THERE ARE TWO ROOKIES ON THIS DALLAS TEAM
THAT HAVE A CHANCE TO EARN THAT HONOR.
ELLIOTT AND PRESCOTT. YOU COULD DEBATE WHICH ONE IS
MORE VALUABLE ON THIS TEAM. PRESCOTT.
LOOKING FOR BRYANT. A FLAG THROWN ON LAWSON.
&gt;&gt; Jon: BRYANT, A HANDFUL FOR THE LIONS.
&gt;&gt; Referee: -- AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN.
&gt;&gt; Sean: ORDINARILY, THAT WOULD BE SLAY ON BRYANT, BUT HE'S OUT
WITH A HAMSTRING. &gt;&gt; Jon: YOU HAVE COACHES IN THE
PRESS BOX THAT SEE HOW THEY ARE DEFENDING DEZ BRYANT.
AND THEN THEY MAKE GREAT ADJUSTMENTS.
THEY HAVE A LOT OF WEAPONS. AND ON FIRST DOWN AND GOAL,
ELLIOTT, BACK IN A FAMILIAR POSITION.
&gt;&gt; Sean: 31-YARD PENALTY, AND THEY'RE JUST INSIDE THE 5 YARD
LINE. CALLING FOR ZEKE.
THEY GIVE IT TO ZEKE. HE GIVES A STIFF-ARM, GETS TO
THE 2 YARD LINE. WILSON, THE BIG TACKLE.
WE MENTIONED THE FEW TURNOVERS FOR DETROIT.
12 COMING IN TO TONIGHT. ONLY ONCE HAVE THEY GIVEN UP A
TOUCHDOWN, THE DEFENSE HAS BEEN GREAT IN THESE SITUATIONS.
&gt;&gt; Jon: THEY HAVE THEIR HANDS FULL NOW.
LOOKING FOR PRESCOTT, HE HAS SIX RUSHING TOUCHDOWNS.
&gt;&gt; Sean: ELLIOTT, OUT OF THE GAME.
THEY GO WITH AN EMPTY SET. PRESCOTT.
FLAG DOWN IN THE END ZONE. PRESCOTT.
BELTS IT OUT OF BOUNDS. WHITEHEAD HIT HIM HIGH.
THERE WAS A FLAG THROWN IN THE END ZONE.
&gt;&gt; Jon: COULD BE HOLDING AGAINST DETROIT, I BELIEVE, IN THE
SECONDARY. HERE COMES THE HEAVY ARTILLERY
FOR THE COWBOYS. &gt;&gt; Referee: BEFORE THE PASS,
HOLDING, DEFENSE, NUMBER 29. THE PENALTY WILL BE HALF THE
DISTANCE FROM THE END OF THE RUN.
AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; Jon: BADEMOSI, 29, IN THE
SLOT. KERRY, 26.
LOOKS LIKE THEY GOT BADEMOSI. THE CROWD LOVES ZEKE ELLIOTT.
&gt;&gt; Sean: HE'S BACK OUT THERE. &gt;&gt; Jon: WATCH OUT FOR THE
SALVATION ARMY BUCKET. &gt;&gt; Sean: YOU LIKE THEIR CHANCES.
THEY'VE SCORED A TOUCHDOWN IN EACH OF THEIR LAST 14 GOAL TO GO
SITUATIONS. ELLIOTT.
TURNS THE CORNER, TOUCHDOWN, DALLAS. &gt;&gt; Jon: POWERFUL MAN.
WITH SPEED TO GET THE EDGE. AND MATTHEW STAFFORD,
INTERCEPTION, COSTLY. MAKES IT LOOK EASY, DOESN'T HE?
&gt;&gt; Sean: HE SURE DOES. EVERYTHING YOU WOULD WANT IN A
RUNNING BACK. DALLAS HAS THE LEAD AGAIN.
AND BAILEY WILL TRY TO MAKE IT SEVEN.
NEARLY 5:00 INTO THE SECOND HALF.
SECOND RUSHING TOUCHDOWN OF THE NIGHT FOR EZEKIEL ELLIOTT.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt; Sean: LOOKING AT THE MEMBERS
OF OUR AUDIO, VIDEO, AND REPLAY TEAMS.
HAPPY HOLIDAYS FROM OUR ENTIRE ESPN "MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL"
FAMILY. MANY OF THE MEN AND WOMEN AWAY
FROM THEIR FAMILIES TO BRING YOU "MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL."
A LOT OF THE CREW MEMBERS BROUGHT THE FAMILY ALONG FOR A
DELIGHTFUL WEEKEND IN DALLAS. &gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT A TEAM WE HAVE.
HAPPY HOLIDAYS. &gt;&gt; Sean: ROBERTS WON'T RUN IT
OUT. DETROIT TRAILING AGAIN, STAFFORD
AND THE LIONS GO BACK ON OFFENSE, DOWN BY SEVEN. SO &gt;&gt; Sean: COMING UP, WE'LL HAVE
THE NFL WILD CARD GAME, MATCHUP DAY AND TIME WILL BE DECIDED.
HAPPY TO HAVE THE NFL POSTSEASON BACK ON ESPN AND ABC, STREAMING
LIVE ON WATCH ESPN. FIRST AND TEN, DETROIT.
LIONS FROM THEIR OWN 25, DOWN BY SEVEN.
10:19 TO GO, THIRD QUARTER. MATTHEW STAFFORD, SHORT SET, AND
THE QUICK THROW TO MULLIGAN. EIGHTH YEAR OUT OF THE
UNIVERSITY OF MAINE, JUST HIS 18th CAREER CATCH.
WHEN HE'S IN THERE, IT'S USUALLY TO BLOCK.
THEY TOOK A MULLIGAN. &gt;&gt; Jon: AND DWAYNE WASHINGTON,
OUT OF WASHINGTON. &gt;&gt; Sean: THEY RAN THE BALL
SURPRIINGLY WELL IN THE FIRST HALF, AND NOW LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE
GOING AWAY FROM IT. TRYING TO PICK UP A YARD ON
SHORT YARDAGE, LOOKED LIKE WASHINGTON GOT THE TWO,
ALTHOUGH, THE SPOT FROM THE NEAR SIDE OFFICIAL IS NOT GOING TO BE
TO THE LINE. &gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT A PLAY BY SEAN LEE.
OFF THE BACKSIDE. HE PENETRATES, MAKING THIS
TACKLE. CAME IN WITH 168 TACKLES.
WHAT A PLAYER. &gt;&gt; Sean: WASHINGTON GETS THE
FIRST DOWN THAT TIME. THE FIRST THREE SERIES OF THE
GAME, DETROIT RUSHED FOR 63 YARDS.
THE NEXT THREE, JUST TWO. BUT THEY DID PICK UP THE FIRST
DOWN ON THE GROUND THERE. &gt;&gt; Jon: AND FOR SEAN LEE NOT TO
MAKE THE PRO BOWL THIS YEAR IS I THINK A BIG MISTAKE.
22 TACKLES AGAINST THE GIANTS, AND HE'S THE HEART AND SOUL OF
THE DALLAS COWBOYS. &gt;&gt; Sean: PLAYED EVERY SNAP THIS
SEASON. THE THROW FOR ERIC EBRON IS LOW.
HE SAID, EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE CLINCHED THE NUMBER ONE SEED, I
WANT TO PLAY EVERY SNAP OF EVERY GAME.
&gt;&gt; Jon: TEN GAMES IN 2012. MISSED FIVE IN 2013, MISSED
EVERY GAME IN 2014. MADE THE PRO BOWL LAST YEAR.
I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT HOW FUN IT IS TO WATCH HIM PLAY.
&gt;&gt; Sean: HE WAS CLASSY ABOUT NOT BEING PICKED THIS YEAR.
SAID HE WAS DISAPPOINTED, BUT APPRECIATES THE TALENT OF THOSE
THAT DID MAKE IT. PASS FOR EBRON, INCOMPLETE.
WAGNER, PICKED AT LINEBACKER. HERE COMES DALLAS WITH THAT 32
DIME PACKAGE. THEY'VE HAD A COUPLE OF SACKS,
AN INTERCEPTION, THREE DOWN LINEMEN, TWO LINEBACKERS.
THEY HAVE BLITZED, THEY HAVE DISGUISED AND RUN OUT OF THE
BLITZ. LET'S SEE WHAT DALLAS DOES HERE.
THIS LOOK HAS DETROIT'S NUMBER. &gt;&gt; Sean: DALLAS HAS THE FOURTH
LOWEST BLITZ RATE IN THE LEAGUE. BUT THE SECOND HIGHEST SUCCESS
RATE IN SACKS WHEN THEY DO BLITZ.
LEE ALMOST GOT THERE. ALMOST INTERCEPTED.
WILCOX GOT IN FRONT OF JONES. &gt;&gt; Jon: IT'S JUST A FOUR-MAN
RUSH, BUT IT'S THE MATCHUPS THEY CREATE.
THEY GET LEE ONE-ON-ONE WITH A RUNNING BACK.
AND HE WALKS ZENNER BACK. STAFFORD LOSES HIS EYE CONTACT
DOWN THE FIELD, AND ALMOST INTERCEPTED AGAIN.
MATTHEW STAFFORD HAS BEEN RUNNING FOR HIS LIFE, AND A LOT
OF IT HAS TO DO WITH THIS PACKAGE, DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR
ROD MARINELLI, HAS THROWN AT DETROIT.
&gt;&gt; Sean: MARTIN, THE PUNTER OUT OF APPALACHIAN STATE.
A VERY GOOD ONE. WHITEHEAD, AT THE 10.
THE FLAG THROWN BY THE OFFICIAL. WHITEHEAD, HIS HELMET CAME OFF.
HE GOT UP, LOOKING LIKE HE WAS READY TO RUMBLE.
54-YARD PUNT, 17-YARD RETURN. &gt;&gt; Referee: DURING THE KICK,
HOLDING, OFFENSE NUMBER 31. HALF THE DISTANCE TO THE GOAL.
FIRST DOWN, TIME-OUT. &gt;&gt; Sean: JONES CALLED FOR THE
COWBOY PENALTY. THEY'LL START FROM THEIR OWN 10
YARD LINE AFTER THIS.           âª Yeeeahhh âª            All free. &gt;&gt; Sean: THE MVP RACE IN THE NFL
SEEMS TO BE WIDE OPEN. CERTAINLY DAK PRESCOTT AND
EZEKIEL ELLIOTT SEEM TO BE IN THE CONVERSATION.
THE ONLY COWBOYS MVP, EMMITT SMITH.
DO YOU HAVE A FAVORITE RIGHT NOW?
STILL A COUPLE OF WEEKS LEFT IN THE REGULAR SEASON.
&gt;&gt; Jon: I'M GOING WITH TB 12 UP IN NEW ENGLAND.
&gt;&gt; Sean: TOM BRADY, HARD TO ARGUE.
ON FIRST DOWN, DEEP IN THEIR OWN TERRITORY, DANGEROUS THROW BY
PRESCOTT. CATCH MADE BY WILLIAMS WITH
LAWSON RIGHT THERE. THERE ARE A LOT OF INTERESTING
CANDIDATES. I THINK MATT RYAN, DEREK CARR
GOT HURT YESTERDAY, HE HAS TO BE IN THE MIX.
&gt;&gt; Jon: AARON RODGERS. &gt;&gt; Sean: AARON RODGERS FOR SURE.
THE LIONS GOT BEATEN BY THE PACKERS.
THE PACKERS MEET THE LIONS NEXT WEEK.
THAT WILL BE THE SHOWDOWN, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS HERE
TONIGHT, DETROIT AND GREEN BAY WILL PLAY FOR THE NFC NORTH
TITLE NEXT SUNDAY NIGHT. THE LIONS LOOKING FOR THEIR
FIRST DIVISION TITLE SINCE 1993. EZEKIEL ELLIOTT, THE BALL
CARRIER. &gt;&gt; Jon: A GREAT PLAY BY WILSON,
THE EX-NEW ENGLAND PATRIOT. WE USED TO CALL THAT A CRACK AND
REPLACE PLAY. THAT TIME, GREAT WORK BY WILSON,
IN A ONE-ON-ONE TACKLING SITUATION AGAINST ELLIOTT.
AND TERYL AUSTIN, THE DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR OF THE LIONS, TAKES
GREAT PRIDE</description>

      <description>WORRY ABOUT THAT WE'RE GOING FOR
IT ANYWAY. &gt;&gt; Allen: WARD IS IN THE GAME AT
THE HALFBACK POSITION. THEY'VE GOT THE BALL HERE.
PRETTY GOOD PURSUIT FROM INSIDE OUT BY TRENT MARTIN TO SET IT UP
FOR REGGIE ROBINSON TO KNOCK HIM DOWN AND NOW THE MUCH LONGER
FOURTH DOWN PLAY THAN THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD THEY
DECLINED THE PENALTY. &gt;&gt; Mike: THEY WERE IN LONG FIELD
GOAL RANGE. NOW THEY'RE IN LONG FOURTH DOWN
RANGE. &gt;&gt; Allen: YEP.
&gt;&gt; Mike: FOURTH AND NINE OR SO AND OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO THROW A PASS MOST LIKELY PAST THAT 10 TO 18-YARD RANGE
WHICH IS A DANGER ZONE FOR QUARTERBACKS BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN
YOU GOT IT MAKE SURE YOU READ COVERAGE AND UNDERSTAND HOW THE
SECONDARY IS PLAYING. &gt;&gt; Allen: ALL THE SAME PRESSURE
HERE. &gt;&gt; Mike: I DON'T THINK SO.
I THINK A THREE BACK, A LOT OF SUCCESS GOING FOR THEIR BACKS
TODAY. &gt;&gt; Allen: RUSH IS UNDER PRESSURE
AND DOWN HE GOES. BUT PETERA WILSON, 44, WAS THE
FIRST ONE TO GET THERE FOR THE GOLDEN HURRICANE.
BALL GOES OVER TO TULSA ON DOWNS.
WE SAW WILSON LIMP OFF THE FIELD INJURED EARLIER AT THE END OF
THE FIRST HALF. HE HAS MADE HIS PRESENCE FELT ON
THE FIELD EARLY IN THIS SECOND HALF.            Hi Santa!             Madison.             A what? âªâª âªâª            Polo Red.            At Macy's.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; BEAUTIFUL SUN ECONOMY MIAMI
FROM OUR AERIAL COVERAGE BROUGHT TO YOU BY DIRECTV.
IF YOU CALL YOURSELF A SPORTS FAN, YOU GOT TO GET DIRECTTV.
IT'S COOLED OFF DOWN TO 78 DEGREES AS THE HEAD ROT GOLDEN
HURRICANE OFFENSE COMES ON THE FIELD.
UP BY 24 POINTS. RESULTS IN NO POINTS AND A
TURNOVER ON DOWNS AND THOUGHT DANE EVANS LEADS THIS TULSA
OFFENSE. TALKED ABOUT HE'S ALREADY GOT A
COUPLE HUNDRED YARDS OF PASSING AND HANDS TO JAMES FLANDERS HAS
A BUNCH ON THIS FIRST DOWN CARRY.
4 YARD LINE FOR THE FIFTH YEAR SENIOR FROM MIDWEST CITY,
OKLAHOMA. &gt;&gt; Mike: NOTHING FANCY.
MISSED TACKLES IN THE SECONDARY AND OFF TO THE RACES.
FLAPERON, WE TALKED ABOUT CAN BREAK TACKLES AND LIKES TO GO
FAST. &gt;&gt; Allen: GETS A FEW THERE ON
THEE FIRST DOWN CARRY. JAMES FLANDERS FIRST TEAM ALL
AMERICAN CONFERENCE. TALKED ABOUT THESE -- LAST SIX
GAMES, 1069 YARD, 178 PER GAME AVERAGE, 6.7 YARDS PER CARRY
AVERAGE, 12 TOUCHDOWNS ALL IN HIS LAST SIX GAMES.
&gt;&gt; Mike: THAT'S THE WAY TO FINISH A SEASON.
THAT'S FINISHING HOT AND ON TOP. &gt;&gt; Allen: HAVE IT AGAIN.
NICE GRAB AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PILE WRAPPING UP AROUND HIS LEGS
BY JABARI DEAN. MR. INSIDE AND MR. OUTSIDE AND
THERE IS JAMES FLANDERS. COACHES SAY HE LIKES TO PLAY
BIGGER THAN HE IS. HE IS NOT AFRAID TO PUT HIS
SHOULDERS DOWN AND PLOW INTO THEM.
&gt;&gt; Mike: HE'S FAST BUT LOVE HIM AS A POWER DOWNHILL BACK.
LOVES TO RUN NORTH AND SOUTH. &gt;&gt; Allen: THIRD DOWN HERE FOR
TULSA. YOU SEE THEY NEED THE 15 YARD
LINE. AND CENTRAL MICHIGAN NEEDS TO
STOP THEM IN THE WORST WAY. &gt;&gt; Mike: TRULY CHALLENGING THE
PASS RUSH OF CENTRAL MICHIGAN. &gt;&gt; Allen: EVANS THE THROW ON THE
RUN INTO THE END ZONE. LUCAS AND COX WERE THERE
FIGHTING AND THE BALL WILL FALL INCOMPLETE AND BRINGS UP FOURTH
DOWN. EVANS LOOKING FOR A FLAG AND
THERE WERE A LOT OF HAND CHECKS GOING ON BACK AND FORTH.
&gt;&gt; Mike: HAND FIGHTING GOING ON. ONCE AGAIN DANE EVANS ESCAPING
THE POCKET AND BOTH PUSHES RIGHT THERE.
A LOT OF WHAT YOU CALL HAND FIGHTING.
&gt;&gt; Allen: SORRY TO SAY, CHIPPEWA FANS BUT JOSH COX HAD A HOLD OF
HIS LEFT ARM AND MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN AWAY WITH ONE.
&gt;&gt; Mike: AN ARM BAR. DON'T RAISE IT UP WHERE THE
OFFICIAL CAN SEE IT. &gt;&gt; Allen: HERE'S REDFORD JONES
WHO HAD A CAREER BEST EQUALING DAY ALREADY IN THIS BOWL GAME.
THIS ONE FROM 39 AND IT'S GOOD. HE'S HIT THREE ALL FROM LONG
DISTANCE TODAY HAS AT RED SHIRT JUNIOR KICKER FROM NORMAN,
OKLAHOMA. 30-3, TULSA.            Go Ahead!                         You too.              Door!            It's cool! &gt;&gt; Allen: ALL RIGHT.
THERE WAS A -- SOMEWHAT OBSCURE PENALTY FLAG ON THAT FIELD GOAL
TRY AND SO. &gt;&gt; Mike: OFFSIDES I BELIEVE GAVE
THEM AN AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN AND CHOSE TO TAKE THE POINTS OFF THE
BOARD. &gt;&gt; Allen: IT'S STILL FOURTH
DOWN, THE YARDAGE WASN'T ENOUGH TO GIVE THEM A FIRST DOWN BUT
BROUGHT THE OFFENSE BACK ONTO THE FEEL AND WILL GO FOR IT ON
FOURTH AND SHORT AND TAKE THE FIELD GOAL OFF THE BOARD.
&gt;&gt; Mike: THAT'S INTERESTING AND BEING TRULY AGGRESSIVE.
HAD YOU GOTTEN THE FIRST DOWN IT'S OKAY TO TAKE POINTS OFF THE
BOARD AND THAT'S HOW YOU GET -- &gt;&gt; Allen: FIRST DOWN AND THEN
SOME. JAMES FLANDERS, CARRIES
DEFENDERS INTO THE END ZONE FOR THE TULSA TOUCHDOWN.
&gt;&gt; Mike: THEY MIGHT HAVE JUST MADE ME A BELIEVER IN THAT.
PHILIP MONTGOMERY, NICE CALL. &gt;&gt; Allen: JAMES FLANDERS, THE
STAR OF THIS DRIVE AND THE SEASON HE'S HAD THE LAST SIX
GAMES WATCH HIM CARRY PEOPLE ACROSS THE GOAL LINE.
&gt;&gt; Mike: YOU KNOW WHAT, HE GOT THROUGH UNTOUCHED FIVE TO SEVEN
YARDS DOWN THE FIELD. LET'S GIVE THAT TOUCHDOWN TO THE
OFFENSIVE LINE. THEY MOVED SOME PEOPLE UP FRONT.
&gt;&gt; Allen: THE BIG HEAVIES. &gt;&gt; Mike: THE BIG HEAVY, THE BIG
UGLIES BUT NOT UGLY WHEN THEY BLOCK LIKE THAT.
&gt;&gt; Allen: FOUR OF THE STARTING FIVE FIRST AMERICAN ALL
CONFERENCE. AND NOW REDFORD JONES FOR THE
POINT AFTER TRY AND IT IS GOOD. REVISE YOUR SCORE CARD TO READ
34-3, TULSA. FIVE PLAYS, 56 YARDS, 1:44.
FLANDERS WITH THE 17-YARD TOUCHDOWN RUN FOLLOWING UP HIS
31-YARDER EARLIER IN THE DRIVE. AND THE GOLDEN HURRICANE KICKING
UP SOME STORM.                âªâª                âªâª                âªâª                âªâª &gt;&gt; Referee: PENALTY ON THE
KICKING TEAM. FIRST DOWN.
&gt;&gt; Mark: ROD, LET'STTER BE READ IN SOME PRETTY GOOD FOOTBALL
PLAYERS. &gt;&gt; Allen: THIRD DOWN FOR RUSH
AND HE IS SWARMED UNDER FOR PETERA WILSON THERE, 44 FOR
THEM. YOU HEARD IT.
&gt;&gt; Mike: COVERAGE SACK. BASICALLY EVERYBODY COVERED DOWN
THE FIELD AND COOPER RUSH TRYING TO BUY TIME IN THE POCKET JUST
RAN OUT OF TIME AND TREMENDOUS JOB OF CLOSING THE WEBB WITH THE
DEFENSIVE LINEMEN AND KEEPING EVERYBODY CONTAINED RUNNING DOWN
THE FIELD. &gt;&gt; Allen: SO NOTHING GOING ON
THAT DRIVE FOR CENTRAL MICHIGAN AND FOURTH AND VERY LONG THE
KICK TEAM WILL COME ON FOR THE CHIPPEWAS.
THAT'S JARION ANDERSON FROM TEXARKANA.
REDTHIRD FRESHMAN. LOOKS LIKE JACK SHELDON WILL BE
THE PUNTER AGAIN. HE'S THE AUSTRALIAN WITH THE
RUGBY-STYLE KICKS. LETS IT FLY.
ANDERSON WILL FIELD IT AT THE 21 AND HE WILL BE DROPPED FAIRLY
QUICKLY BY DAMON TERRY, ONE OF THE BIG SPECIAL PLAYERS.
LATE FLAG COMES IN AT THE END OF THAT ONE.
JOHN BONAMEGO, SPECIAL TEAMS COACH, HE TALKED ABOUT SPECIAL
TEAMS BEING A WAY FOR A PLAYER TO ESTABLISH HIMSELF AND STAND
OUT. THAT'S WHAT DAMON TERRY HAS
DONE, THE REDSHIRT FRESHMAN FROM LANCING, STOOD HIM UP AFTER --
&gt;&gt; Referee: PERSONAL FOUL, KICKING TEAM, NUMBER 23, 15-YARD
PENALTY, FIRST DOWN, TULSA. &gt;&gt; Allen: YOU DON'T NEED THAT.
STOOD HIM UP IN FRONT OF THE TEAM AND SAID HERE'S HOW YOU
EARN PLAYING TIME. HERE'S HOW YOU PRACTICE.
HERE'S WHAT YOU DO TO STAND OUT. &gt;&gt; Mike: RIGHT, AND THE EASIEST
WAY TO GET ON THE FIELD FOR YOUNG PLAYERS IS ON SPECIAL
TEAMS. BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT TO
BE THE STARTER ON OFFENSE OR DEFENSE BUT YOU CAN TRRT ON FOUR
DIFFERENT SPECIAL TEAMS AND MAKE A HUGE IMPACT ON THE GAME.
&gt;&gt; Allen: ALL RIGHT, SO THE TULSA OFFENSE WILL COME BACK OUT
ONTO THE FIELD. AWFUL LOT OF RECORDS THAT CAN BE
BROKEN TODAY BY VARIOUS PLAYERS ON THIS GOLDEN HURRICANE TEAM.
THE BIGGEST ONE, OF WHICH, THEY BROKE EARLIER WHEN JOSH ATKINSON
WENT OVER A THOUSAND YARDS RECEIVING ON THE YEAR.
THIS D'ANGELO BREWER WHO WILL HAVE THE BALL FOR TULSA AND
GRIND OUT A DECENT GAIN ON FIRST DOWN.
SO, LOOK AT SOME OF THE NEXT BOWLS COMING UP.
OUR CAPITAL BOWL ONE MANIA CONTINUES.
OF COURSE, WE'LL CAP IT OFF WITH THE COLLEGE FOOTBALL NATIONAL
CHAMPIONSHIP GAME. NEW YEAR'S SIX, COLLEGE FOOTBALL
PLAYOFF SEMIFINALS UNDER WAY. LOVE TO PICK YOUR BRAIN -- WHOA,
WHAT A HIT BY D'ANGELO BREWER. HE GOT HIT BY TONY ANNESE HARD.
&gt;&gt; Mike: HE IS A CAPTAIN AND STARTED 38 GAMES IN HIS CAREER
TEED UP BUT KNOWS HOW TO LOWER THE BOOM AND SEE RIGHT THERE,
RIGHT THERE -- THAT WAS -- THEY GO SO FAST HARD TO GET A REPLAY.
JUST UNBELIEVABLE. &gt;&gt; Allen: KEEVAN LUCAS HAD THAT
ONE ON THE FLY SWEEP. JOSH COX KNOCKED HIM OUT OF
BOUNDS. &gt;&gt; Mike: WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT
BEING UP BY 31 POINTS, DO YOU SLOW THE GAME DOWNY NO, NO, THE
TEMPO FOR TULSA IS WHAT THEY LIVE FOR.
THE KIDS LOVE IT AND THEY'RE GOING TO KEEP GOING FAST.
&gt;&gt; Allen: DUMP IT OFF. MINTER, THE TIGHT END AGAIN
LOOKING TO CONTINUE TO FIGHT AND CARRY PLAYERS FORWARD.
AND ANOTHER FIRST DOWN FOR THE GOLDEN HURRICANE.
&gt;&gt; Mike: CENTRAL MICHIGAN DOING SUBSTITUTING AND KEEPING THEM
FRESH AND PLAYING A LOT OF PEOPLE BECAUSE THE PACE OF
PLAYING TULSA IS TAKING ITS TOLL.
&gt;&gt; Allen: GOING DEEP. TOUCHDOWN, LUCAS.
&gt;&gt; Mike: JOHN BONAMEGO WILL HAVE A TALK WITH HIS KIDS.
YOU BETTER KEEP UP OR THEY'LL TAKE IT TO YOU IF YOU DON'T.
&gt;&gt; Allen: YEAH, THAT KIND OF DAY FOR THOSE WEARING MAROON AND
GOLD. BUT EVANS TO LUCAS NOW FOR A
31st TIME IN THEIR CAREERS TOGETHER AT TULSA.
&gt;&gt; Mike: IT WAS A COMBINATION OF A LITTLE BIT OF
MISCOMMUNICATION, MISSED COVERAGE ON THE BACK END AND
WHAT PACE AND TEMPO DOES TO YOU, HARD TO COMMUNICATE AND GET
LINED UP. &gt;&gt; Allen: IT WAS 10-3 AT THE END
OF THE FIRST QUARTER, TULSA SCORED 17 IN THE SECOND.
AND NOW HAVE SCORED 14 IN THE THIRD TWO BAGELS ON THE
SCOREBOARD FOR THE CHIPPEWAS. SEVEN POSSESSION, SEVEN SEVEN POSSESSION, SEVEN
         Nobody's hurt,              Smart.           [SFX: Bong!]             Guilty.               LOL. &gt;&gt; Allen: TULSA LEADING CENTRAL
MICHIGAN BIG. MORRIS WATTS, 78-YEAR-OLD
OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR FOR THE CHIPPEWAS WHO TOLD US YESTERDAY
TODAY WILL BE HIS LAST GAME AS A COLLEGE FOOTBALL COACH BRINGING
DOWN THE CURTIN ON A 53-YEAR COLLEGE FOOTBALL COACHING
CAREER. &gt;&gt; Mike: PRETTY AMAZING.
I CAN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND. I'M 66 NOW.
THAT'S 12 MORE YEARS OF COACHING AND HAS SO MUCH ENERGY AND SO
MUCH ABILITY TO RELATE TO YOUNG PEOPLE.
THAT'S AMAZING. &gt;&gt; Allen: THIS WILL BE EMMETT
THOMAS AGAIN. GET KNOCKED TO THE GROUND ABOUT
THE 28 YARD LINE. WATCH HAS BEEN ON ABOUT A WHO'S
WHO OF COACHING STAFF AS CROSS THE YEARS.
THIS ONE PICTURE INTRIGUES US THE MOST.
LOOK AT THE PEOPLE ON THIS STAFF.
THAT'S JIM GRUDEN. &gt;&gt; Mike: YEAH, FAMOUS NAME.
WE KNOW HIM. &gt;&gt; Allen: LEE CORSO.
AND, OF COURSE, MORRIS WATTS, JIM JOHNSON, HE'S BEEN AT
MICHIGAN STATE AND LSU. SO MANY PLACE, HE WAS JUST A GEM
TO TALK -- FIRST TIME I HAD MET HIM.
HE WAS SO MUCH FUN TO TALK TO AND HAD SO MANY GREAT STORIES
AND SO ENTERTAINING. &gt;&gt; Mike: HIGH SCHOOL, NFL, U.S.
NFL. I COACHED AGAINST HIM AT
MICHIGAN STATE. I TO WHAT HE CAN DO.
EXCEPTIONAL. SO MUCH KNOWLEDGE AND SEEN SO
MUCH OFFENSE OVER THE YEARS AND HOW DEFENSES TRANSITION AND
CHANGE AND TALKED ABOUT RECRUITING.
HE SAID, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ALL THIS TWITTER STUFF OR WHATEVER.
&gt;&gt; Allen: KRIS. &gt;&gt; Kris: TALKING ABOUT THE
STORIES, HE GRADUATED FROM TULSA SO I ASKED HIM, IS THIS A LITTLE
BIT OF FULL CIRCLE PLAYING TULSA IN THE FINAL GAME OF YOUR
CAREER? HE GOES, FULL CIRCLE.
NOBODY REMEMBERS THAT TIME WHICH WENT THERE.
MY TULSA SHIRT, THEY ALL HAVE HOLES IN THEM.
THIS ISN'T FULL CIRCLE. SO LONG AGO.
&gt;&gt; Allen: 1961 GRADUATE. COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYER FOR
TULSA. ALL THE PLAYERS NOW MOST ALL OF
THEM HAVE iPADS THEY GET THEIR GAME FILM ON AND STUDY SHEETS
AND SO ON, TOUGH YARDAGE THERE FROM JONATHAN WARD.
COACH CAME INTO THE ROOM. HE HAD A PAD, REGULAR WHITE
LINED PAD WITH HIM WITH ALL HIS DEPTH CHART WRITTEN ON IT BY
HAPPEN AND SAID THEY HAVE iPADS. I HAVE PADS.
&gt;&gt; Mike: I RESEMBLE THAT REMARK. I KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT
OF YOU SAW ME. I TAKE NOTES ON PAPER, NOT
TYPING OR WHATEVER THE CASE -- IT'S AN AMAZING -- HE HAS SUCH
ENERGY AND HE CAN RELATE AND I AM SO HAPPY TO SEE HIM GO OUT ON
HIS OWN TERMS. &gt;&gt; Allen: WHAT HE WILL MISS THE
MOST IS PLAYERS TRYING TO GET BETTER.
KERWIN THOMAS BANGED UP A LITTLE.
GOOD TO SEE HIM UP WALKING OFF OF THE FIELD UNDER HIS OWN
POWER. SO QUICK REMINDER WHILE WE GET
THINGS RESET HERE, THE BOWL ACTION CONTINUING WEDNESDAY, THE
SAN DIEGO COUNTY CREDIT UNION POINSETTIA BOWL, BYU VERSUS
WYOMING 9:00 P.M. STREAMING LIVE ON THE ESPN APP AND WATCH ESPN.
&gt;&gt; Mike: HILL OUT OF THAT GAME AND INTERESTING THING TO COME IN
AND SEE HOW THE OFFENSE CHANGES. &gt;&gt; Allen: LAST YEAR STARTER
TANNER MANGUM WILL COME IN AND GO UNDER CENTER FOR THE COUGARS.
THIRD DOWN AND THREE. COUGAR RUSH BURIED.
UNDER PRESSURE, JESSE BRUBAKER GOT THROUGH AND KNOCKED THE
QUARTERBACK DOWN. &gt;&gt; Mike: NUMBER, THEIR BIGGEST
PLAYMAKER LEADING THEM IN TACKLES FOR LOSS, JUST AN
ENERGIZER BUNNY COMING OFF THE EDGE HERE.
YOU SEE HIM ON A LITTLE TWIST INSIDE.
JUST COMES UNTOUCHED AND GETS TO THE QUARTERBACK AND GREAT JOB OF
JUMPING THE ROUTES IN THE SECONDARY BY TULSA'S
DEFENSIVE -- &gt;&gt; Allen: RUSH YOU LIKE THAT
WIDE OPEN WITH THE QUARTERBACK IN FRONT OF YOU, GOT TO MAKE YOU
SMILE. RIGHT THROUGH THE MOUTHPIECE.
&gt;&gt; Mike: SALIVATING. &gt;&gt; Allen: IF YOU'RE THE
QUARTERBACK AND SEE THAT COMING, IT'S OH, NO, OH, NO.
SO SHELDON TO PUNCH -- PUNT AGAIN, RATHER.
KICK THAT, A LITTLE SKIP INSIDE THE 40 AND GET A NICE ROLL.
AND DOWN AT ABOUT THE 31 YARD LINE.
SO WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFF AND
SEMIFINALS COMING UP ON DECEMBER 31st.
ASKED FOR PREDICTIONS ON THAT AND FEARLESSLY TELL THE WORLD.
&gt;&gt; Mike: I HIKE THAT TEAM A LOT. I THINK ALABAMA IS A CLASS OF --
NEXT GAME, OHIO STATE/CLEMSON REALLY STUFF.
I'LL TAKE OHIO STATE TO BE HONEST AND THAT BOTTOM GAME, I
DON'T KNOW. I THINK ALABAMA HAS THE BEST
DEFENSE IN THE NATION. THEY RELOAD SO WELL AND GOT
AWAY. FIND A WAY.
SO I TELL YOU WHAT, IT'LL BE EXCITING AND INTERESTING.
I DON'T COUNT OUT WASHINGTON BECAUSE I TRUST CHRIS PEARTSON
AND STAFF BUT ALABAMA PROBABLY TOO GOOD.
&gt;&gt; Allen: DANE EVANS AND TULSA OFFENSE GO TO WORK AT THEIR OWN
31 YARD LINE AND IT'LL BE D'ANGELO BREWER WHO WILL HAVE A
FIRST DOWN AND ABOUT FIVE MORE. 15 ON THAT FIRST DOWN RUN FOR
THE JUNIOR FROM TULSA. SO BIGGER PICTURE ALSO.
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF OTHER BOWL GAMES, YEAH, WHAT, 42 BOWL GAMES
AND LOOK AT THE MATCH-UPS AS THEY COME UP.
OOH, I LIKE THAT. OOH, I LIKE THAT.
AS KEEVAN LUCAS HAS THE GRAB. THERE WERE A COUPLE THAT
INTRIGUED YOU PARTICULARLY. &gt;&gt; Mike: WELL, THE USC/PENN
STATE GAME. TWO OF THE HOTTEST WITH A CHIP
ON THEIR SHOULDER TOO BUT I THINK USC IS PLAYING AS GOOD A
FOOTBALL AS THERE IS IN THE NATION.
PROBABLY THE BEST TEAM OVERALL IN THE PAC-12.
THEY SCHOOLED WASHINGTON A LITTLE BIT SO THAT GAME EXCITES
ME. I THINK MICHIGAN IS ANOTHER
ABOUT BEING LEFT OUT AND I THINK THEY'LL IMPOSE THEIR WILL ON
SOME PEOPLE BUT THERE ARE SOME GAMES OUT THERE.
I LIKE THE LSU MATCH-UP WITH LOUISVILLE.
I THINK LSU HAS THE TYPE OF</description>

      <description> A USED CAR,           TRUCK, SUV.          THAT'S SMART.        TRUECAR CAN HELP.      IT'S GREAT
     FOR FINDING A NEW CAR,    BUT YOU ALREADY KNEW THAT.   IT'S ALSO GREAT FOR FINDING
  THE PERFECT USED CAR.         YOU'LL SEE WHAT
        A FAIR PRICE IS,   AND YOU CAN CONNECT WITH
  A TRUECAR CERTIFIED DEALER.      SO, NO MATTER WHAT
     YOU'RE LOOKING FOR...           THERE IT IS.      THIS IS HOW BUYING
     A USED CAR SHOULD BE.         THIS IS TRUECAR.                                âª âª

&gt;&gt; Sean: BACK IN LANDOVER, MARYLAND, FEDEX FIELD.
HEADING TOWARD THE SECOND HALF. VERY IMPORTANT GAME FOR THE
WASHINGTON REDSKINS NOW, THEY'RE IN PLAYOFF POSITION, THEY'LL
LOSE CONTROL OF THEIR OWN DESTINY.
IT'S 13-9, CAROLINA, WE CHECK THE QUARTERBACK NUMBERS.
CAM NEWTON BELOW 50% COMPLETION PERCENTAGE.
THE NUMBERS QUITE SIMILAR WITH KIRK COUSINS.
TIME FOR TONIGHT'S ZALES XTRAORDINARY MOMENTS.
&gt;&gt; Jon: RUNNING GAME GOING.  THEY'VE MADE SOME BIG GAMES IN
THE PASSING GAME. HERE YOU SEE MIKE TOLBERT.
THEY FAKE THE BALL, THEY PULL IT OUT OF THE BACK CHEST AND THEY
PUT A SLANT RIGHT IN THERE TO TED GINN.
MAXIMUM PROTECTION. DONTE WHITNER AT FREE SAFETY
BLOWS A COVERAGE AND TED GINN, ONCE AGAIN, NO PASS RUSH.
THE REDSKINS WILL HAVE TOOUT SCORE THE DEFENSE.
IF NOT FOR THE PENALTY BY CAM NEWTON, THIS GAME MIGHT BE
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. &gt;&gt; Sean: IT LOOKED LIKE CAM
NEWTON MIGHT NOT BE LONG FOR THIS GAME.
CAME IN WITH A SHOULDER ISSUE, AN MRI EARLIER THIS WEEK DIDN'T
REVEAL ANY DAMAGE. HE WAS ORE.
LIMITED IN PRACTICE. HE TOLD US HE FELT FINE.
SOME DIFFERENT PASSES. AS THE HALF WENT ALONG.
WILL BLACKMON WILL TRY TO RETURN THE KICKOFF.
DIDN'T GO WELL. &gt;&gt; Lisa: SEAN, I ASKED JAY
GRUDEN HOW HE HOPES TO GENERATE MORE OFFENSE IN THE SECOND HALF.
HE SAID WE CAN'T BE 2 FOR 6 ON THIRD DOWN.
WE HAVE TO RUN THE BALL BETTER. TO START THIS HALF TO START TO
ESTABLISH THE GROUND GAME AND HE SAID HE HOPES THAT SHOULD HELP
WITH THE FLOW. RON RIVERA SAID HE WAS UPSET
WITH THE POOR TACKLING OF HIS TEAM IN FIRST HALF.
AS FOR THE OFFENSE HE THOUGHT THEY DID A LOT OF THINGS REALLY
WELL AND MISSED OUT OF OPPORTUNITIES.
GUYS. &gt;&gt; Sean: ALL RIGHT, LISA THANK
YOU. FIRST DOWN, WASHINGTON.
PANTHERS SHOW BLITZ AND BRING IT.
AND COUSINS LOST THE BALL! IT'S RECOVERED BY CAROLINA AND
HE'S DOWN SHY OF THE GOAL LINE. &gt;&gt; Jon: THE PANTHERS BLITZ IT
AND VERNON DAVIS STRUGGLING IN PASS PROTECTION.
VERNON CAME FROM ACROSS THE FORMATION AND WES HORTON COME
PRESSES THE POCKET. THAT BALL IS OUT.
FIRST DOWN, CAROLINA &gt;&gt; Referee: FUMBLE RECOVERED BY
THE DEFENSE. SHORT OF THE GOAL LINE.
FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; Sean: IF THAT'S THE CASE,
IT'S BARELY THE CASE. SHADES OF A YEAR AGO WHEN THEY
WERE AFTER COUSINS ALL DAY LONG IN CAROLINA'S BIG WIN AGAINST
THE REDSKINS IN CHARLOTTE. THEY HAD FIVE TAKEAWAYS IN THAT
GAME. &gt;&gt; Jon: THAT'S THE 40th SACK FOR
CAROLINA. &gt;&gt; Referee: 61 IS AN ELIGIBLE
RECEIVER. &gt;&gt; Sean: HORTON HAS BEEN AROUND
FOR FOUR YEARS, OUT OF USC, UNDRAFTED OUT OF COLLEGE.
HE HAD HIS FIRST FUMBLE RECOVERY OF HIS CAREER LAST WEEK AGAINST
SAN DIEGO AND NOW HE HAS HIS SECOND.
IT WILL BE THE SHORTEST SCORING DRIVE IN CAROLINA HISTORY IF
THEY CAN PUNCH IT IN. DIXON, THE TIGHT END.
RESET AT THE LINE. AND STEWART STOPPED.
IT WILL BE A LOSS. &gt;&gt; Jon: GOOD PENETRATION BY THE REDSKIN DEFENSE.
AND SECOND AND GOAL. &gt;&gt; Sean: HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO
STOP THE OPPONENTS ONCE THEY REACH THE 1 YARD LINE.
&gt;&gt; Jon: DAVID YANKEY TIGHT END AT THE TO BOTTOM OF YOUR SCREEN.
&gt;&gt; Sean: MIKE TOLBERT, THE FULLBACK IN FRONT OF JONATHAN
STEWART. THIS TIME A PASS, TOLBERT IS
OPEN IN THE FLAT, EXTENDS THE BALL, TOUCHDOWN, PANTHERS!
&gt;&gt; Jon: GOOD PLAY SELECTION. PLAY-ACTION PASS.
YOU SENT OLSEN TO THE CORNER YOU SLIP MIKE TOLBERT INTO THE FLAT
AND TOLBERT HAS MADE A LOT OF PLAYS IN GOAL TO GO SITUATIONS
IN HIS CAREER. WHAT YOU DO, YOU GET A TURNOVER,
YOU CASH IT IN IMMEDIATELY AND CAROLINA HAS A CHANCE TO GO UP
11. &gt;&gt; Sean: TOLBERT'S FIRST
TOUCHDOWN THIS SEASON. 45th OF HIS CAREER, NINE-YEAR
VETERAN OUT OF COASTAL CAROLINA, ALSO THE SCORE JOSH NORMAN
ATTENDED. GRAHAM GANO ADDS THE EXTRA
POINT. JUST MORE THAN A MINUTE GNE BY
AND ANOTHER TOUCHDOWN ON THE BOARD FOR THE PANTHERS.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt; Sean:
&gt;&gt; Sean: DISAPPOINTING START FOR VERNON DAVIS AND THE WASHINGTON
REDSKINS HERE IN THE SECOND HALF.
LOST FUMBLE LEADS TO A CAROLINA TOUCHDOWN.
11-POINT LEAD FOR THE VISITORS. GRAHAM GANO TO KICK OFF.
CHRIS THOMPSON AND BASHAUD BREELAND.
THIS ONE IS RETURNABLE. DROPPED FOR A MOMENT BY CHRIS
THOMPSON AND THE REDSKINS NEED TO WAKE UP.
MICHAEL GRIFFIN MADE THE TACKLE. &gt;&gt; Jon: A LOOK AT THAT SACK,
DAVIS COMES ACROSS THE FORMATION AND WES HORTON DOES A GREAT JOB
OF BEATING DAVIS FOR THE SACK AND YOU SAID IT, WASHINGTON WHO
TURNED IT OVER FIVE TIMES LAST YEAR AGAINST CAROLINA IN A
DEFEAT. IS GOING TO HAVE TO GET
SOMETHING GOING. &gt;&gt; Sean: REALLY FROM THE START
OF THE GAME IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHICH TEAM WAS PLAYING FOR ITS
PLAYOFF LIVES YOU WOULD THINK IT WAS THE CAROLINA PANTHERS.
THEY HAVE PLAYED WITH GREAT ENERGY FROM THE BEGINNING.
ROBERT KELLEY DIDN'T GET BACK TO THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE.
KIWANN SHORT FROM PURDUE. &gt;&gt; Jon: HE HAD 11 SACKS, BUT
IT'S THE RUN DEFENSE THAT HE BRINGS TO THIS DEFENSE. HE'S A GAME WRECKER INSIDE.
HARD TO RUN AGAINST. &gt;&gt; Sean: COUSINS ON SECOND AND
TEN. JAMISON CROWDER NUDGED OUT OF
BUNDS BY DARYL WORLEY. THIRD DOWN AND FOUR FOR THE
REDSKINS. &gt;&gt; Jon: THE DEFENSIVE
COORDINATOR IS BRINGING A LOT OF BLITZES.
HE BLITZED ON THE FIRST PLAY IN THE SECOND HALF.
HERE'S ONE EARLY IN THE THIRD QUARTER.
THEY'RE PLAYING A LOT OF ZONE BLITZ COVERAGES.
THIS MAN WAS TRAINED IN PHILADELPHIA BY THE GREAT JIM
JOHNSON AND THIS DEFENSE STRONGLY RESEMBLES IT TONIGHT.
&gt;&gt; Sean: COUSINS WITH TIME. DeSEAN JACKSON LOOKING AT HIS
HANDS LIKE HE COULDN'T BELIEVE THE BALL WENT THROUGH HIS HANDS.
&gt;&gt; Jon: FRUSTRATING. IT'S ANOTHER ZONE BLITZ.
YOU'LL HAVE TO BE PATIENT AND MAKE THESE CATCHES UNDERNEATH.
DeSEAN JACKSON WHO LIKES TO GO DEEP, THEY'RE TAKING THAT WAY
AND THEY'LL FORCE YOU TO DO SOME THINGS YOU DON'T WANT TO DO.
UGLY START TO THE THIRD. &gt;&gt; Sean: WOW.
YOU'RE NOT KIDDING. BACK FOR A LOSS FUMBLE AND A
THREE AND OUT FOR WASHINGTON ON OFFENSE.
TED GINN. TRYING TO PICK UP SOME BLOCKERS.
ALONG THE FAR SIDELINE AND A GOOD RETURN AND THERE'S AN
INJURED REDSKIN, YOU SAW THE BLOCKING AS GINN TURNED THE
CORNER. AND QUINTON DUNBAR SLOW TO GET
UP FOR WASHINGTON.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt; Sn:
&gt;&gt; Sean: ESPN'S MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY
NAVY FEDERAL CREDIT UNION. FEDERALLY INSURED BY NCUA.
BY TOYOTA, LET'S GO PLACES. BY NFL.COM/PROBOWL ON SALE.
BY YOUR TICKETS THE 2017 PRO BOWL IN ORLANDO TODAY.
PANTHERS INVOLVED IN MANY ACTIVITIES.
SPREAD SOME HOLIDAY CHEER AROUND THE CHARLOTTE AREA.
CAM NEWTON DISTRIBUTED A TOTAL OF 100,000/OF FUNDS, FOOD AND
GIFTS TO PEOPLE IN NEED IN THE CHARLOTTE AREA.
KELVIN BENJAMIN. HE HELD ON.
AND HAS A FIRST DOWN. MEANWHILE, DeSEAN JACKSON A
MOMENT AGO HAD A CHANCE TO MAKE A BIG PLAY FOR WASHINGTON.
TOUGH TO TELL WHAT THIS WAS ALL ABOUT.
&gt;&gt; Jon: HE'S JUMPING, HE TAKES HIS EYES OFF THE BALLER, GOT TO
MAKE A PLAY, THIRD AND FOUR, WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY FIRST DOWN
AND YOUR BEST PLAYERS GOT TO MAKE PLAYS IN CRITICAL MOMENTS.
AND RIGHT NOW, IT'S GOING TO COME DOWN TO THEIR DEFENSE.
THEY GOT TO GET OFF THE FIELD. &gt;&gt; Sean: FIRST AND TEN.
CAM NEWTON AND THE PANTHERS BACK IN REDSKINS' TERRITORY.
PLAY FAKE TO JONATHAN STEWART WHO STAYED IN THE BLOCK AND
NEWTON'S PASS NOT IN DIRECTION OF ANY OF HIS TEAMMATES.
OFFICIALS TALKING IT OVER. BAKER WANTS AN INTENTIONAL
GROUNDING. AND WALT COLEMAN IS ABOUT TO
DROP THE FLAG. &gt;&gt; Jon: NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.
&gt;&gt; Referee: INTENTIONAL GROUNDING.
NUMBER 1. OFFENSE.
LOSS OF DOWNS. SECOND DOWN.
&gt;&gt; Jon: THIS IS WHAT CAM NEWTON TALKED TO US ABOUT LAST NIGHT.
HAVING A KILLER INSTINCT. YOU HAVE A TEAM ON THE ROPES.
PUT THEM AWAY. WHAT THEY DID LAST YEAR WHEN
THEY WERE 15-1. IT'S SOMETHING THEY HAVE BEEN
UNABLE TO DO ON A CONSISTENT BASIS THIS YEAR.
LET'S SEE IF THEY CAN REGROUP, GET HALF OF IT BACK AND SHOW
SOME KILLER INNINGS TINT WHILE THE REDSKINS ARE REELING.
&gt;&gt; Sean: SECOND AND 20. FIVE-MAN RUSH.
NEWTON GOT IT OFF. CAUGHT.
TED GINN JR. RETREATING. BACK TO THE LINE TO WHERE HE
CAUGHT IT. &gt;&gt; Jon: THE ZONE BLITZ.
BUT YONT BE MORE WIDE OPEN, JUST A HOOK ROUTE BY TED GINN.
SETS UP THIRD DOWN AND LONG. &gt;&gt; Sean: THIRD DOWN AND 12.
CAROLINA JUST 1 OUT OF 7 ON THIRD DOWN AGAINST THE WORST
THIRD DOWN TEAM IN THE LEAGUE. DOUBLE COVERAGE AND IT WAS
ALMOST INTERCEPTED BY JOSH NORMAN!
INTENDED FOR TED GINN JR. &gt;&gt; Jon: AND THAT'S GREAT PLAY BY
NORMAN. JUST A GO ROUTE BY TED GINN AND
WATCH THE CLOSE AND THE LAYOUT BY NORMAN.
HE'S AN EXCELLENT PLAYER AND AN OUTSTANDING COMPETITOR.
AND A BIG STOP BY THE REDSKIN DEFENSE.
&gt;&gt; Sean: WE ASKED JAY GRUDEN YESTERDAY IF YOU'RE WORRIED
ABOUT NORMAN BEING TOO HYPED UP. HE SAID HE'S ALWAYS HYPE UP.
WON'T BE ANY DIFFERENT. AND HE SAID THAT IN AN
APPRECIATIVE WAY, JAMISON CROWDER TAKEN DOWN BY LOU YOUNG.
REDSKINS BALL, DOWN BY 11. &gt;&gt; Sean:
&gt;&gt; Sean: JOSH NORMAN SPENT THE FIRST FOUR YEARS OF HIS CAREER
WITH CAROLINA. RELATIVELY OBSCURE UNTIL LAST
YEAR WHEN HE WAS A PRO BOWLER FOR THE FIRST TIME, PLAYING
AGAINST HIS OLD TEAM FOR THE FIRST TIME TONIGHT.
&gt;&gt; Jon: A COUPLE OF SLANT PASSES.
ONE OF THEM OFF THE PLAY ACTION, MADE A BEAUTIFUL PLAY HERE OFF
THE DEEP BALL. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO CATCH
NORMAN VERY OFTEN. &gt;&gt; Sean: MOST FOOTBALL FANS KNOW
THE STORY, CAROLINA PLACED THE FRANCHISE TAG ON HIM WHEN IT
LOOKED LIKE THEY WEREN'T GOING TO AGREE TO HOW IT WOULD WORK
OUT FINANCIALLY IN THE FUTURE THEY RESCINDED THE FRANCHISE TAG
AND NOT LONG AFTER HE SIGNED WITH THE WASHINGTON REDSKINS.
$51 MILLION GUARANTEED. ROBERT KELLEY AFTER ONE-YARD
GAIN. &gt;&gt; Jon: THEY HAVE HAD NO RUNNING
GAME AT ALL TONIGHT. THEY FALL BEHIND THE CHAINS AND
NOW THEY'RE ABLE TO MIX UP THESE PRESSURES AND THESE ZONE BLITZ
COVERAGES THAT SEAN McDERMOTT HAS HAD GREAT SUCCESS WITH IN
THE LAST SIX, SEVEN WEEKS WITH THE PANTHERS.
THIS DEFENSE IS IMPROVING. &gt;&gt; Sean: ON SECOND DOWN, COUSINS
OVER THE MIDDLE. PIERRE GARCON DOWN TWO YARDS SHY
OF THE FIRST DOWN. THOMAS DAVIS 345ED THE TACKLE.
&gt;&gt; Jon: THOMAS DAVIS AND A.J. KLEIN, I LIKE KLEIN, ANOTHER
UNKNOWN PLAYER OUT OF IOWA STATE WHO HAS PLAYED A LOT OF GOOD
FOOTBALL IN LUKE KUECHLY'S ABSENCE.
WHERE IS JORDAN REED? NURSING A SHOULDER.
TEN SNAPS LAST WEEK. HE MISSED THE ARIZONA GAME.
BUT, JORDAN REED'S PRESENCE NOT EXISTENT TONIGHT.
&gt;&gt; Sean: PAINFUL INJURY, TRYING TO PLAY THROUGH IT BUT KELLEY
DENIED. DIDN'T EVEN GET BACK TO THE LINE
OF SCRIMMAGE AND EVERYBODY RAVING ABOUT HIS ABILITY TO MAKE
SOMETHING OUT OF NOTHING. BUT HE GOT NOTHING ON THAT PLAY.
MARIO ADDISON LEADING THE WAY FOR CAROLINA.
&gt;&gt; Jon: AND AN INJURED REDSKIN ON THE PLAY.
THAT MIGHT BE JORDAN REED. &gt;&gt; Sean: THEY HAVEN'T TARGETED
JORDAN REED TONIGHT. HE'S HAD 60 CATCHES FOR THE YEAR
COMING IN. TIME-OUT, 9:21 TO GO.
THIRD QUARTER.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt; Jason: BACK TO BACK
TIME-OUTS. &gt;&gt; Rod: THAT'S
LOUISIANA-LAFAYETTE BEGGING. WE'RE USING EVERY TIME-OUT WE
HAVE. THEY'RE TRYING TO BUY TIME HERE.
&gt;&gt; Jason: THIS IS THE OPPOSITE OF DEAN SMITH'S FOUR CORNERS.
&gt;&gt; Jason: YOU SAW IT AS WE FROZE IT.
AT ZEROS. IT LOOKS LIKE THE BALL IS STILL
NOT TOUCHING THE GROUND. &gt;&gt; Rod: YEAH, I THINK, YOUR
POINT -- THE BALL WAS SNAPPED -- &gt;&gt; Referee: LOUISIANA-LAFAYETTE
WILL NOT BE CHARGED WITH A TIME-OUT.
THE PREVIOUS PLAY IS UNDER FURTHER REVIEW.
&gt;&gt; Jason: MARK HUDSPETH MAY HAVE A CAREER IN LOBBYING.
&gt;&gt; Rod: WELL -- HE CERTAINLY KNOWS HOW TO BUY TIME.
HE WAS STALLING AND STALLING AND USING TIME-OUTS AND, I MEAN, IT
WAS ALL BUT SAYING, WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO TO GET YOU GUYS TO
LOOK AT THE PLAY? &gt;&gt; Jason: HIS TEAM HAS SCORED A
COUPLE OF TOUCHDOWNS IN A ROW, WOULD LOVE TO GO IN THE LOCKER
ROOM TIED. LET'S SEE.
WATCH WHERE THE BALL IS AT ZEROS.
HE'S STILL HOLDING IT. &gt;&gt; Rod: YEAH.
HALF'S OVER. SHOULD BE OVER.
&gt;&gt; Jason: THAT'S INDISPUTABLE TO YOU, RIGHT?
&gt;&gt; Rod: YEAH. HE CLEARLY SPIKES IT AFTER.
WE SEE THE CLOCK AT ZERO WHEN THE BALL IS IN HIS HANDS.
&gt;&gt; Jason: AGAIN, THE RULING ON T THERE IS ONE
SECOND REMAINING ON THE CLOCK. YOU'D HA TO HAVE INDISPUTABLE
VIDEO EVIDENCE TO CHANGE THE CALL.
&gt;&gt; Rod: COUNSELOR, I'M GOING TO SAY THAT IS CLEAR EVIDENCE.
&gt;&gt; Jason: YEAH. &gt;&gt; Rod: WHEN WE WERE ABLE TO
SLOW THAT DOWN AND THEY FREEZE IT, I THINK THAT MADE IT PRETTY
CLEAR. &gt;&gt; Jason: HERE'S THE WORD.
TOM STAPLETON HAS IT FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; Referee: AFTER REVIEW, IT WAS
DETERMINED THAT THE CLOCK EXPIRED PRIOR TO THE BALL BEING
SPIKED ON THE THIRD DOWN PLAY. THE HALF IS OVER.
&gt;&gt; Jason: WELL DONE BY MARK HUDSPETH TO KILL SOME TIME, GET
THE REVIEW AND HEAD INTO HALFTIME TIED AT 14.
SOUTHERN MISS AND ULL ARE TIED, AS WE HEAD TO THE STUDIO FOR THE
HALFTIME REPORT. CHRIS COTTER?
&gt;&gt; BUICK HALFTIME REPORT. CHRIS COTTER WITH DANNY KANELL
AND J GALLOWAY. HERE, LAS VEGAS BOWL.
DON NELL PUMPHREY NEEDED 108 YARDS TO START THE DAY TO SET
THE NEW CAREER FBS RUSHING MARK. MAJOR APPLEWHITE, THE NEW JOB AT
HOUSTON. SLOW START, BUT REALLY GOT
COOKING IN THE SECOND QUARTER. &gt;&gt; FIRST QUARTER, I THINK HE WAS
NEGATIVE FOUR. IN THE SECOND QUARTER, GOT
THINGS ROLLING. MADE SOME ADJUSTMENTS UP FRONT.
YOU CAN SEE THE BLOCKING. &gt;&gt; THIS SCORE WOULD PUT SAN
DIEGO STATE UP TOP FOR GOOD, BECAUSE ON THE NEXT POSSESSION,
YES, FAMILY LIKED IT IN THE STANDS.
GREG WARD PICKED OFF BY RON SMITH.
WHAT HAPPENED HERE? &gt;&gt; TWO WIDE RECEIVERS RUNNING A
BUBBLE SCREEN. ONLY ONE OF THEM WAS SUPPOSED
TO. THE OTHER WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
BLOCKING. THAT MISCOMMUNICATION COST THEM
A PICK SIX. &gt;&gt; IT WAS 20-10 AT THIS POINT,
AND THE SITUATION NOW IS, WOULD HE SET THE RECORD?
AND HE DOES. &gt;&gt; INTERESTING TO SEE HIM BOUNCE
IT OUTSIDE. WE KNEW THAT HOUSTON WAS TOUGH
AGAINST THE RUN, BUT THE QUICKNESS TO GO OUTSIDE AND GET
INTO THE SECONDARY. AND THEN HE WAS TOUGH TO STOP.
&gt;&gt; CURTIS ANDERSON HAULING IN THIS TOUCHDOWN PASS.
IT WAS ALL ACADEMIC AT THIS POINT.
CELEBRATING THE WIN. 34-10, THE FINAL.
ROCKY LONG GETTING THE GATORADE BATH.
HERE'S HOW IT ALL SHAPES OUT. PUMPHREY, 6,405 RUSHING YARDS.
PASSES RON DAYNE, WHO PASSED RICKY WILLIAMS ONE YEAR AFTER
WILLIAMS SET THE RECORD. HAS BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THE
FACT THAT PUMPHREY HAD ADDITIONAL GAMES BECAUSE THE
BOWL RECORDS DIDN'T COUNT BACK THEN.
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN TAKE ANYTHING AWAY FROM HIM, RIGHT?
&gt;&gt; NO, IT'S BEEN A GREAT DAY. YOU SHOULD HAVE TO JUDGE
EVERYBODY ON EQUAL SCALE. &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING CHANGES.
&gt;&gt; OUTSTANDING DAY. YOU SAW THE NAMES HE'S MENTIONED
WITH THERE. I'LL BE EXCITED TO SEE WHAT HE
DOES AT THE NEXT LEVEL, BEING A SMALLER TYPE BACK.
CAN HE SURVIVE? HE'S NOT GOING TO BE A FEATURE
BACK, BUT SOME OFFENSE IS GOING TO FIND A WAY TO GET A PLAYMAKER
LIKE HIM THE BALL. &gt;&gt; NFL GMs HAVE TO BE LOOKING
THAT, COMING INTO THE NEXT LEVEL.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S THE AMAZING PART, HE'S 180 POUNDS, HE'S 5'9".
LOOK AT THE RUNNING BACKS HE'S PASSING, THOSE ARE BIG RUNNING
BACKS. YOU EXPECT THEM TO BE ABLE TO
TAKE A POUNDING. WITH HIS QUICKNESS AND
ATHLETICISM, THE ABILITY TO BOUNCE IT OUTSIDE AND GET TO THE
SECONDARY, AND IT IS INTERESTING WHEN YOU WATCH HIM PLAY.
HE'S HARD TO TACKLE. HE BREAKS THROUGH TACKLES.
THOSE ARM TACKLES, HE GETS THROUGH THEM SOMEHOW AT 5'9",
180 POUNDS. &gt;&gt; I PLAYED WITH WARRICK DUNN,
FLORIDA STATE. LASTED A LONG TIME IN THE NFL.
YOU TALK ABOUT SHIFTINESS, YOU COULD NEVER GET A GOOD LICK ON
HIM, BECAUSE HE JUST HAD A KNACK.
BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
&gt;&gt; SPROLES IS KIND OF A GUY LIKE THAT RIGHT NOW, WHO PLAYS IN A
LIMITED ROLE. BUT A VALUABLE ROLE FOR THE
EAGLES.</description>

   SRIRACHA CHICKEN SANDWICH   DONE DELICIOUSLY DIFFERENT.             SRIRACHA           JACK CHEESE             SRIRACHA          INFUSED AIOLI.        AND EVEN SRIRACHA       BAKED INTO THE BUN.     SOME MIGHT THINK WENDY'S
     IS TAKING IT TOO FAR.         BUT IF YOU SPEAK        SRIRACHA, SRIRACHA             SRIRACHA      YOU UNDERSTAND THAT'S
         NOT POSSIBLE.      WENDY'S SPICY SRIRACHA
       CHICKEN SANDWICH.        YOURS TO LOVE FOR
        A LIMITED TIME.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; 14-14, ALL TIED AT THE R+L
CARRIERS BOWL, AND THIS IS JUDGE ITO SMITH WITH THE TOUCHDOWN FOR
SOUTHERN MISS. QUINT KESSENICH CAUGHT UP WITH
JAY HOPSON AT THE BREAK. &gt;&gt; QUITE AN EVENTFUL HALF, COACH
WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION TO THE LAST CALL, WHERE THEY DIDN'T
GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO KICK THE FIELD GOAL?
&gt;&gt; I GOT TO LOOK AT IT AGAIN, BUT IF THAT IS WHAT I SAW ON THE
SCREEN, IT'S THE RIGHT CALL. I GOT TO PROBLEM WITH THE RIGHT
CALL. BUT AGAIN, THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKED
TO ME THERE, SO WE'LL SEE. &gt;&gt; 14-0 LEAD.
WHAT CHANGED THERE? &gt;&gt; WE HAD A TURNOVER AND WE HAD
A COUPLE PENALTIES. I MEAN, SO, WE GOT TO CLEAN THAT
UP AND GET READY TO PLAY. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, COACH.
&gt;&gt; NEW MEXICO BOWL. HOME GAME, THE NEW MEXICO LOBOS.
FOURTH QUARTER. UTSA TRAILING.
NICE PLAY ACTION AND A GREAT CATCH BY HERE TREVOR STEPHENS.
&gt;&gt; UTSA DID A NICE JOB RUNNING THE BALL ALL DAY LONG.
THEN THEY OPENED UP THE PLAY ACTION PASS TO THE TIGHT END.
&gt;&gt; NEW MEXICO RUNS THE BALL BETTER THAN ANYDY IN THE
COUNTRY. RICHARD McCORLEY WITH THE SCORE,
GIVING NEW MEXICO THE TEN-POINT LEAD.
BUT STURM FINDS TAYLOR, AND UTSA TRAILED BY JUST THREE, BUT THE
ONSIDE KICK, DANNY, GOES WANTING.
&gt;&gt; I LIKE THE ATTEMPT THERE, THE FAKE ONE WAY, GO THE OTHER, BUT
NEW MEXICO, WELL COACHED FROM OUR BUDDY BOB DAVIES,
OUTSTANDING JOB GETTING THIS PROGRAM TO A NINE-WIN SEASON.
&gt;&gt; NINE WINS THIS YEAR, GREAT MULTISPORT HEAD FAKE THERE TO
AVOID THE GATORADE BATH.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; RAYCOM MEDIA CAMELLIA BOWL.
THIS WAS A GOOD ONE. TOLEDO WITH THE KICKOFF.
DARRENSON EVANS TAKES IT OFF THE BOUNCE.
LOOK AT THE MOVES AND THE QUICKNESS ON THE RIGHT SIDE.
&gt;&gt; SOMETIMES WHEN THE BALL HITS THE GROUND, IT THROWS OFF THE
COVERING TEAM. THEY ALL HAVE LANES TO BE IN.
THEY KIND OF GET OUT OF THEIR LANE AND THEN IT'S AN EASY TRIP
DOWN THE SIDELINE. &gt;&gt; 94 YARDS, THE MOUNTAINEERS
LEADING 28-21. SECOND AND GOAL HERE FOR TOLEDO.
KAREEM HUNT HAD A GREAT GAME FOR THE ROCKETS.
TYING THE GAME AT 28. APP STATE WOULD KICK A FILD
GOAL TO GIVE A THREE-POINT LEAD. TWO MINUTES LEFT.
FOURTH AND TWO FROM THE EIGHTH. TOLEDO TAKE AS DELAY OF GAME
PENALTY. &gt;&gt; REALLY WEIRD.
INEXPLICABLE WHAT HAPPENED THERE.
AND YOU WATCH HOW CLOSE THIS MISSES, YOU WONDER IF IT WOULD
HAVE BEEN GOOD FROM THE ORIGINAL POSITION.
&gt;&gt; WE'LL NEVER KNOW.</description>

      <description>APP STATE GETS THE 31-28 WIN.
&gt;&gt;&gt; CAPITAL ONE BOWL MANIA HERE. DANNY AND JOEY'S PICKS, RIGHT
NOW FOR THE UPCOMING GAMES. AND THE POINT TOTALS START TO
MOVE UP A LITTLE BIT HERE. &gt;&gt; THAT AP STATE/TOLEDO GAME WAS
THE ONE GAME THAT WE HAD DIFFERENT.
&gt;&gt; DANNY BEING THIS CLOSE AFTER ONE DAY IS A WIN FOR HIM.
I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S EVER BEEN THIS CLOSE.
&gt;&gt; I'M RIGHT WHERE I WANT TO BE. &gt;&gt; IN SECOND PLACE.
&gt;&gt; BIG PULL FOR MEMPHIS HERE FOR D.K.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; IVISION II CHAMPIONSHIP
GAME. NORTH ALABAMA AGAINST NORTHWEST
MISSOURI STATE IN SNOWY KANSAS CITY.
DANNY, I KNOW YOU LOVE THIS KIND OF WEATHER.
YOU'RE ALL OVER IT. &gt;&gt; I LOVE THAT LITTLE SHOVEL
PASS THERE, TOO. THAT GOES DOWN AS A TOUCHDOWN
PASS. &gt;&gt; THE RECEPTION THERE.
7-0 BEAR CATS. FOURTH QUARTER.
ZIMMERMAN FINDS SHANE WILLIAMS HERE, THROUGH THE SNOW AND THE
SCORE. 23-3.
YES, SIXTH NATIONAL TITLES, INCLUDING THREE IN THE LAST FOUR
YEARS FOR NORTHWEST MISSOURI STATE.
FCS SEMIFINALS. YOUNGSTOWN STATE AND EASTERN
WASHINGTON. LOOK AT THIS PLAY, WITH SIX
SECONDS LEFT. HOW DOES THIS RECEIVER HOLD ONTO
THE BALL? &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE BEST CATCH IN
COLLEGE FOOTBALL THIS SEASON. HOLDS ONTO THE BALL.
WE'LL NEVER KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PILE,
BECAUSE -- &gt;&gt; IN THE WAY.
&gt;&gt; OFFICIAL CALLED THE TOUCHDOWN.
&gt;&gt; KEVIN RAIDER WITH THE TOUCHDOWN.
BO PELINI, THAT'S AS EVER HAPPY AS YOU'RE GOING TO SEE HIM.
YOUNGSTOWN STATE ADVANCES TO THE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME.
THEY WILL PLAY AGAINST JAMES MADISON.
MINNESOTA ENDS THEY BOYCOTT OF THE NATIONAL FUNDING HOLIDAY
BOWL AGAINST WASHINGTON STATE. ACC FINES LOUISVILLE AND
VIRGINIA TECH $25,000 FOR THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN THE WAKE FOREST
SCANDAL. AND THE ARMY ATHLETIC DIRECTOR
HAS BEENEN INSTRUCTED TO CONDUCT INVESTIGATION INTO IF THEY
RECEIVED IMPROPER INFORMATION IN THIS WHOLE WAKE FOREST SCANDAL.
DANNY, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS THING AS IT CONTINUES TO
PROGRESS AND MOVE ON? &gt;&gt; IT'S ONE OF THE MORE BIZARRE
STORIES, WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED.
A GUY SOLD OUT HIS OWN UNIVERSITY.
PLAYED AT WAKE FOREST, COACHED AT WAKE FOREST, NOW ON THE
RADIO. SABOTAGING HIS OWN UNIVERSITY.
MAKES NO SENSE. I DON'T THINK YOU'LL EVER SEE
THIS HAPPEN AGAIN, JUST TO MAKE SURE, THE ACC DID LEVY THE
FINES. &gt;&gt; NOT UNEXPECTED TO SEE COACHES
GET PLAYS FROM THE OTHER TEAM. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOOTBALL
COACHES HERE, SOMEBODY GIVES THEM PLAYS, THEY'RE GOING TO
TAKE THEM. &gt;&gt; I'VE GOT TO THINK THAT I'M
PROBABLY GOING TO GET PINCHED, I'M GOING TO GET CAUGHT.
DO YOU THINK THIS IS GOING TO STAY UNDERNEATH THE RUG FOREVER?
THIS WAS A VERY UNUSUAL TYPE OF SITUATION?
&gt;&gt; WELL, THEN, YOU TURN AROUND, SAY, I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT. &gt;&gt; GALLOWAY DEFENSE RIGHT THERE.
&gt;&gt; WHAT PLAY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
&gt;&gt; COACH ARE ALWAYS TRYING TO LOOK FOR SOMETHING.
THERE IS SOME LINE THERE, BUT FOR A GUY FROM HIS OWN
UNIVERSITY TO NOT ONLY SELL THE COACHES AND THE PLAYERS ON THAT
TEAM, JUST COMPLETELY SABOTAGED THEM.
&gt;&gt; HE WAS IN THE CIRCLE OF TRUST, IF YOU WILL.
STILL ASSOCIATING, GETTING INSIDE ACCESS.
ALL RIGHT, STILL PLENTY TO GET TO HERE ON THE BUICK HALFTIME
REPORT. HOW ABOUT ANTHONY JENNINGS,
TAKING IT IN FOR THE RAGIN' CAJUNS, ALL TIED UP AT 14 FROM
NEW ORLEANS.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; HOW ABOUT THIS BASKETBALL
GAME EARLIER TODAY? KENTUCKY TAKING ON NORTH
CAROLINA. UNDER TWO TO GO.
KENTUCKY DOWN THREE. MALIK MONEYING FOR THREE.
WATCH THIS, LITTLE STEP BACK HERE.
HE STILL HAD A HAND IN HIS FACE, BURIED IT.
&gt;&gt; CAN'T PLAY MUCH BETTER DEFENSE THAN THAT.
HE JUST BEAT YOU. &gt;&gt; JUSTIN JACKSON HERE.
THE AND ONE FOR NORTH CAROLINA. WOULD MISS THE FREE THROW, BUT
TAR HEELS UP TWO. UNDER 30 SECONDS LEFT TO GO, WHO
IS IT GOING TO GO TO IN MONK. THIS GAME, 47 POINTS FOR THE
GAME, DANNY. &gt;&gt; HE WAS ON FIRE.
EVERYTHING HE THREW UP THERE WENT IN.
&gt;&gt; AS A FRESHMAN.  .7 LEFT.
KENNY WILLIAMS, THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD LOOK -- NO.
GOOD LUCK. DIDN'T GET IT TO GO, THOUGH.
&gt;&gt; GREAT GAME. &gt;&gt; GREAT GAME.
KENTUCKY, 103-100.</description>

&gt;&gt;&gt; WHAT A GREAT FIRST HALF STAGGERS HAS HAD.
202 YARDS, AND WE'RE NOT DONE YET.
ENTERTAINING SECOND HALF IN NEW ORLEANS.
WE'LL BRING IT TO YOU AFTER THIS.
ALL TIED AT 14.  NOT EVERYONE SPEAKS SRIRACHA.             SREE-RA- CHA?      BUT WENDY'S IS FLUENT.  THEY KNOW WHEN A TRUE FAN SAYS             SRIRACHA        THEY REALLY WANT A

      <description>THE R+L CARRIERS NEW ORLEANS
BOWL, AS PART OF CAPITAL ONE BOWL MANIA.
AND IT'S BEEN SOMETHING OF A MANIC FIRST HALF.
14-0, SOUTHERN MISS. LOUISIANA-LAFAYETTE, BEHIND
ANTHONY JENNINGS CAME BACK, AND WE ARE DEADLOCKED AT 14.
JASON BENETTI, ROD GILMORE, QUINT KESSENICH DOWNSTAIRS.
ESSENTIALLY TWO HALVES FIT INTO ONE HALF HERE AT THE SUPERDOME,
ROD. &gt;&gt; Jason: YEAH A LOT OF BIG
PLAYS. IT WAS SOUTHERN MISS AT FIRST,
AND THEN IT WAS LOUISIANA-LAFAYETTE REALLY KIND
OF TAKING OVER. YOU HAVE THINK ABOUT, WHAT HAS
TO HAPPEN IN THIS BALL GAME AND WHAT THE STORY LINES HAVE
BEEN -- YOU KNOW, KIDNAP STAGGERS, IF YOU ARE
LOUISIANA-LAFAYETTE. HE'S DOMINATED THIS BALL GAME.
SET A BOWL RECORD WITH MORE THAN 200 YARDS IN THE FIRST HALF.
AND THEN, YOU HAVE TO PROTECT ANTHONY JENNINGS.
HE'S BEEN SACKED FOUR TIMES. AND FOR BOTH TEAMS, YOU ARE STAR
RUNNING BACKS, AND THEY HAVEN'T TOUCHED THE BALL ENOUGH.
GET THE BALL TO ITO SMITH. GET THE BALL TO McGUIRE.
&gt;&gt; Jason: THOSE ARE OUR STORY LINES, BROUGHT TO YOU BY JARED,
THE GALLERIA OF JEWELRY. DOWNSTAIRS, QUINT KESSENICH.
&gt;&gt; Quint: 15 IS KILLING US, THE WORDS OF MARK HUDSPETH.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A GENIUS. 202 YARDS, LESS THAN 100 AWAY
FROM A SCHOOL RECORD. LOOK FOR MORE MAN COVERAGE
AGAINST STAGGERS. THEY WENT TO MAN EARLY IN THIS
GAME AND GOT TORCHED. SO, THEY PLAYED A LOT OF SEWN
AND HE FOUND THE SOFT SPOTS IN THE ZONE.
THE KEY IS GOING TO BE GETTING PRESSURE ON THE QUARTERBACK TO
PLAY IN MAN-TO-MAN BEHIND IT FOR COACH HUDSPETH'S DEFENSE.
OFFENSIVELY, HE LIKES WHAT THEY DID IN THE SECOND QUARTER,
AGAINST THAT JUNK YARD DEFENSE, WHEN THEY ACTUALLY RAN THE BALL
AND GASHED TH UP THE MIDDLE AGAINST THE JUNK YARD "D."
&gt;&gt; Jason: SEE HOW BOTH TEAMS ADJUST. SIDELINES HAVEN'T ADJUSTED.
STILL A PARTY OVER THERE. SOUTHERN MISS AND ULL PLAYING
THE SECOND HALF. AND SOUTHERN MISS WILL HAVE IT
FIRST FROM THE 25 YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; Rod: SEVEN POSSESSIONS, THE
FIRST TWO, THEY GOT SCORED. THE LAST FIVE -- WE'LL LOOK AT
THE LAST FOUR. MISSED FIELD GOAL.
AND THEN, THIS WAS A BIG TURNOVER THAT GOT
LOUISIANA-LAFAYETTE BACK IN THE BALL GAME, TROUBLE BY MULLENS.
AND THEN, A SACK ENDED ANOTHER POSSESSION.
AND THEN, RIGHT BEFORE THE END OF THE HALF, YOU DIDN'T GET DOWN
AND SAVE SOME CLOCK AND SO YOU MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A
FIELD GOAL. THERE YOU SEE, SEVEN
POSSESSIONS, AND THE LAST FIVE HAVE NOT BEEN GOOD.
&gt;&gt; Jason: THAT WOULD HAVE ALLOWED, HAD ROBERTSON GOTTEN
DOWN, A 45-YARD FIELD GOAL. THERE WAS ONE SECOND ORIGINALLY
ON THE CLOCK, BUT NOW, HERE WE GO WITH THE SECOND HALF.
NICK MULLENS, THE SENIOR QUARTERBACK OUT OF HOOVER,
ALABAMA. WE SAID, GET THE BALL TO ITO
SMITH. HE'S GOT THE FIRST TOUCH OF THE
SECOND HALF. AND AGAIN, HIS ABILITY TO CUT IN
SPACE IS IMPRESSIVE. &gt;&gt; Rod: CHANGE DIRECTION.
HE'S A GUY THAT CAN PUT HIS FOOT ON THE GROUND.
GET JUMPED AND GO THE OTHER WAY. JUST GOT TREMENDOUS QUICKNESS.
&gt;&gt; Jason: SECOND-TEAM ALL-CONFERENCE USA PLAYER, ITO
SMITH, WHO RAN FOR OVER 170 YARDS IN THE WIN AGAINST
KENTUCKY TO OPEN THE YEAR. LOADS OF TIME AGAIN FOR MULLENS,
AND NOBODY HOME. FLAG DOWN.
IN THE SECONDARY. TWO OF THEM, IN FACT, JUST SHORT
OF THE 50 YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; Rod: I THINK THEY GOT
MITCHELL HANGING ONTO STAGGERS. &gt;&gt; Jason: YOU SAID KIDNAP HIM.
THAT'S THE FIRST STEP. &gt;&gt; Rod: I DIDN'T SAY MUG HIM.
&gt;&gt; Referee: HOLDING, DEFENSE, NUMBER 17.
TEN-YARD PENALTY. FIRST DOWN.
&gt;&gt; Jason: IT IS THE FRESHMAN, MITCHELL.
&gt;&gt; Rod: HERE'S THAT MAN COVERAGE.
YOU HEARD QUINT TALKING ABOUT IT.
THAT'S A MUGGING. YOU GRAB HIM BY THE SHOULDER PAD
AND SLOW HIM DOWN. THAT'S GOING TO GET -- YOU'RE
NOT EVEN TRYING TO HIDE THAT ONE FROM THE REFS.
&gt;&gt; Jason: WALLET, CAR KEYS, HOUSE KEYS, LOOSE CHANGE.
MULLENS OPENED 7 FOR 8, COOLED OFF LATE.
AND THAT ONE IS INCOMPLETE. STAGGERS GOT DRILLED.
WALKER LIT HIM UP. &gt;&gt; Rod: DID HE GO TOO HIGH?
THAT'S CONTACT ABOVE THE SHOULDER.
&gt;&gt; Jason: FLAG'S COME IN. &gt;&gt; Rod: YEAH.
IT LOOKS LIKE HE LAUNCHED, TO ME, AND HE WENT HIGH FOR THAT
HIT. &gt;&gt; Referee: PERSONAL FOUL,
TARGETING, DEFENSE, NUMBER 23. 15-YARD PENALTY.
AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. THE PLAY IS UNDER FURTHER
REVIEW. &gt;&gt; Jason: NOW, DID TRACEY WALKER
GET THE SHOULDER PAD FIRST? &gt;&gt; Rod: WELL, IT DOESN'T HAVE TO
BE HELMET TO HELMET. DO YOU GO ABOVE THE NUMBERS,
HEAD OR NECK AREA. HE LEADS WITH THE SHOULDER.
AND HE GETS UP REALLY HIGH NEAR THE HEAD.
&gt;&gt; Jason: AND HE LAUNCHED, AS YOU SAID.
&gt;&gt; Rod: AND HE LAUNCHED. NOW, THE IDEA IS THAT YOU REALLY
TRY AND LOWER THE HITTING TARGET AND YOU GET PLAYERS TO HIT AT
THE NUMBERS OR BELOW. THIS WAS A CLEAR ATTEMPT TO GO
HIGH. SEE THE LAUNCH THERE?
HE COMES UP ON THE TOES TO GO UP HIGH.
&gt;&gt; Jason: THAT'S WHAT OFFICIALS CALL AN INDICATOR OF TARGETING.
THAT'S REAL TIME THAT THE OFFICIALS ARE LOOKING AT.
AGAIN, YOU'RE LOOKING FOR FORCIBLE CONTACT TO THE HEAD OR
NECK AREA. AND THEN ONE OF THOSE INDICATORS
OF TARGETING, WHICH IS CLEARLY THERE, AS YOU SAID.
&gt;&gt; Rod: REALLYLÃ­ GAME TO BE SAFER, AND YOU WANT
GUYS TO WRAP UP AND TAKE THAT HIT AT THE MIDSECTION, AT THE
NUMBERS. AND WHEN YOU HAVE GUYS THAT SEE
THE OPPORTUNITY TO LAUNCH THEMSELVES AND GO HIGHER AND TO
GET THAT INTIMIDATING HIT UPSTAIRS, THOSE ARE THE RUNS
THAT ARE GOING TO GET FLAGGED. &gt;&gt; Jason: I MEAN, WE HAD LONG
DISCUSSIONS PRIOR TO THIS SEASON, WE HAD A REPLAY SEMINARY
TALKING ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FORCIBLE CONTACT TO THE
HEAD OR NECK AREA, PLAY TO PLAY. AND THERE'S A LOT OF WIGGLE ROOM
THERE. &gt;&gt; Rod: YOU CAN MAKE THE SAME
INTIMIDATING HIT RUNNING THROUGH THE GUY AT THE NUMBERS, WRAPPING
HIM UP. PROBABLY KNOCKING THE WIND OUT
OF HIM. BUT WHEN YOU TRY AND LAUNCH AND
GO UP ABOVE THE NUMBERS, AROUND THE HEAD, YOU'RE TRYING TO SEND
THAT INTIMIDAING MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; Referee: AFTER REVIEW, THE
RULING ON THE FIELD STANDS. NUMBER 23 IS DISQUALIFIED FROM
THE GAME. &gt;&gt; Jason: SO, YOU LOSE YOUR
STARTING SAFETY, TRACEY</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt; Jason: STAGGERS BACK TO
RECEIVE THE PUNT FROM COUTTS. AND NICE COVERAGE AS STAGGERS
ARE DROPPED AT THE 26 YARD LINE. TRAVIS CRAWFORD GOT DOWN THERE
AFTER A NET OF 36. TWO TEAMS THAT ARE MOST OFTEN
HERE AT THE R+L CARRIERS NEW ORLEANS BOWL,
LOUISIANA-LAFAYETTE HAS WON FOUR IN A ROW, TWO OF THOSE HAVE BEEN
VACATED. NICK MULLENS AND SOUTHERN MISS,
A TEAM THAT WAS 0-12 JUST FOUR SEASONS AGO, TRYING TO FINISH
7-6 FOR FIRST-YEAR HEAD COACH JAY HOPSON.
MULLENS IS COMING TO THE SIDELINE.
KEON HOWARD -- MULLENS WILL STAY IN AS A WIDE RECEIVER.
KEON HOWARD IN AT QUARTERBACK. &gt;&gt; Rod: WILDCAT.
&gt;&gt; Jason: HOWARD WITH THE HURDLE.
AND NOTHING MUCH THERE, AS A FLAG DOES COME IN.
WE NEED A TOTE BOARD FOR HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN A SNAP
TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; Rod: FOUR OF THEM ALREADY?
&gt;&gt; Jason: YEAH. I THINK IT'S FIVE NOW.
&gt;&gt; Rod: YOU'RE RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Jason: THREE QUARTERBACKS FOR
THE CAJUNS. TWO FOR SOUTHERN MISS.
&gt;&gt; Referee: OFFSIDE, DEFENSE, NUMBER 6.
FIVE-YARD PENALTY. FIRST DOWN.
&gt;&gt; Rod: YOU KNOW, MOST TEAMS ROTATE A RUNNING BACK.
WE'RE ROTATING QUARTERBACKS TONIGHT.
&gt;&gt; Jason: AND THE FIRST QUARTER IS STILL GOING ON.
FIVE QUARTERBACKS SO FAR. AND THAT WILL DO IT FOR OUR
FIRST 15 MINUTES. &gt;&gt; Referee: THAT'S THE END OF
THE FIRST QUARTER. &gt;&gt; Jason: SOUTHERN MISS AND
LOUISIANA-LAFAYETTE FROM NOT FAR DOWN THE ROAD, JUST A COUPLE
HOURS AWAY. THEY'VE BROUGHT THE FIRE SO FAR.
14-7 IN THE R+L CARRIERS NEW ORLEANS BOWL AFTER THIS.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Jason: COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFF ON THE WAY.
JUST 14 DAYS AWAY NOW. YOU GOT TO MAKE YOUR PICKS SOON.
&gt;&gt; Rod: I GOT TIME, RIGHT? &gt;&gt; Jason: I'M GOING TO PUT YOU
ON THE SPOT VERY SOON.  QUARTER.
A BIG BAND THERE. WE GOT CAUGHT IN BETWEEN THEM ON
THE WAY TO THE FIELDERIER TODAY. AND NICK MULLENS, SENIOR
QUARTERBACK, HAS BEEN DINGED UP QUITE A BIT THIS YEAR.
GOES DOWN THE MIDDLE AGAIN AND HE ONCE AGAIN HAS GOT STAGGERS.
INSIDE THE 45. &gt;&gt; Quint: WHEN THEY GIVE MULLENS
TIME, HE'S GOING TO DISSECT THESE CORNERS IN THE SECONDARY.
ALSO RIGHT HERE, SHANNON DAWSON TALKED ABOUT TRICK PLAYS.
HE'S NOT GOING TO BE OUTDONE, THROWING THE TRICK PLAYS OUT BY
THE LOGO. &gt;&gt; Jason: RIGHT AT THE 44.
&gt;&gt; Rod: THE REGULAR PLAYS ARE WORKING JUST FINE.
MAY NOT NEED THE TRICK PLAYS. &gt;&gt; Jason: MULLENS, 5 OUT OF 6,
151 YARDS. WAS SHOWING BLITZ FROM THE
CORNERS. HERE HE COMES.
AND MULLENS THROWS IT RIGHT THERE FOR A COMPLETION TO D.J.
THOMPSON. &gt;&gt; Rod: GOOD JOB OF THROWING
INTO THE BLITZ. YOU KNOW, A LOT OF QUARTERBACKS
ARE TAUGHT, LISTEN, WHEN YOU FIND WHERE THE BLITZ IS COMING
FROM, YOU THROW THAT WAY BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT TO COVER IT UP.
SOMEONE HAS TO GO COVER THAT RECEIVER, AND YOU CAN GET THE
BALL THERE BEFORE THAT DEFENDER CAN.
&gt;&gt; Jason: ITO SMITH. THAT'S A FIRST DOWN.
AND YOU TALK ABOUT MULLENS, HERE IS A GUY THAT'S HAD CONCUSSION
PROBLEMS THIS YEAR. HE HAD ONE GAME WHERE HE WAS HIT
AND A BONE WAS STICKING OUT OF HIS THUMB.
HE WENT TO THE SIDELINE, SAID, COACH, TAPE IT UP, PUT ME BACK
IN. LET ME PLAY.
&gt;&gt; Rod: OH. OH.
BONE STICKING OUT OF HISTHUMB? OH.
&gt;&gt; Jason: YEAH, THAT'S A LITTLE GRUESOME.
&gt;&gt; Rod: I'M A LITTLE SQUEAMISH. &gt;&gt; Jason: ON FIRST DOWN.
MULLENS WITH A DART ACROSS THE 20 YARD LINE.
ONCE AGAIN, STAGGERS. &gt;&gt; Rod: THEY ARE NOT GETTING
CLOSE TO MULLENS. GOT PLENTY OF TIME.
YOU HEARD QUINT TALK ABOUT IT EARLIER.
WHEN HE'S GOT TIME, HE'S CARVING THEM UP.
AND LOUISIANA-LAFAYETTE IS GETTING NO PRESSURE ON HIM.
AND THIS OFFENSE HAS STRUGGLED AT TIMES TO PROTECT HIM.
&gt;&gt; Jason: THAT'S ONE THING YOU WERE WATCHING COMING INTO THE
GAME IS, MULLENS AND HIS PROTECTION.
AND IT'S BEEN STRONG. AND HE'S OFF THE MARK THIS TIME
FOR D.J. THOMPSON. &gt;&gt; Rod: YOU'RE RIGHT.
WE EXPECTED LOUISIANA-LAFAYETTE TO REALLY DO SOME OVERLOAD
PRESSURES ON THE EDGES. THE TACKLES FOR SOUTHERN MISS
HAVE STRUGGLED AT TIMES TO PROTECT HIM.
AND, HE GOT A CONCUSSION, HE'S BEEN HIT A LOT.
BUT TONIGHT, LOUISIANA-LAFAYETTE IS NOT GETTING CLOSE TO HIM.
&gt;&gt; Jason: YOU BRING MORE PEOPLE? WHAT DO YOU DO?
&gt;&gt; Rod: YEAH, YOU KEEP ADDING UNTIL YOU GET THERE.
&gt;&gt; Jason: SMITH. ANOTHER GEAR.
CHANGING DIRECTION. INSIDE THE 10 YARD LINE, AND A
FLAG COMES IN AS SMITH ENDS UP IN THE END ZONE!
&gt;&gt; Rod: I DON'T THINK HE WENT DOWN.
WHAT BALANCE. I THINK HE PUT HIS HAND DOWN AND
KEPT FROM FALLING. &gt;&gt; Referee: HOLDING, OFFENSE,
NUMBER 70. TEN-YARD PENALTY FROM THE SPOT
OF THE FOUL. SECOND DOWN.
&gt;&gt; Rod: YOU KNOW -- I DON'T CARE WHETHER IT'S GOOD OR NOT.
THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL RUN. OKAY.
LOOK AT THAT. THAT KNEE, I DON'T THINK THAT
LEFT KNEE IS DOWN. THE ELBOW IS DOWN.
THAT'S SUCH A BEAUTFUL RUN, THOUGH.
YEAH. GOT A PENALTY ANYWAY.
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED DOWN, BUT WHAT A DYNAMIC RUN.
HE SHOWED YOU SOME PATIENCE, CHANGE OF DIRECTION, JUST WATCH
THIS RUN. PATIENCE.
CHANGE OF DIRECTION, A MOVE. BALANCE.
LITTLE SPRINT RIGHT THERE -- WOW.
&gt;&gt; Jason: MY GOODNESS. &gt;&gt; Rod: THAT IS REALLY NICE.
&gt;&gt; Jason: THEY DON'T TAKE HIM OUT IN THIRD DOWN.
HE CAN PASS PROTECT. CATCH THE BALL OUT OF THE
BACKFIELD. ITO SMITH.
THE HOLDING PENALTY BRINGS IT BACK, THOUGH.
MULLENS. DOWN THE MIDDLE AGAIN TO THE 11
YARD LINE FOR STAGGERS ONE MORE TIME, IT'S A GAIN OF EIGHT.
&gt;&gt; Rod: SO, JASON, ONE OF THE ADJUSTMENTS THAT
LOUISIANA-LAFAYETTE WILL HAVE TO DEAL IS, STAGGERS IN THE SLOT IS
A PROBLEM. THEY'VE HAD HIM MATCHED UP WITH
SAFETIES, WITH LINEBACKERS. THEY DON'T HAVE A GUY TO DEAL
WITH THT. SO, THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
ADJUST AND DEAL WITH THAT. HE'S KILLING THEM.
&gt;&gt; Jason: HE'S 30 SHY OF THE BOWL RECORD INUTES.
MULLENS CHANGING THE PLAY. GOT TO SNAP IT.
AND HE DIDN'T GET IT OFF IN TIME.
&gt;&gt; Referee: DELAY OF GAME. OFFENSE.
FIVE-YARD PENALTY. THIRD DOWN.
&gt;&gt; Jason: SO, THAT WILL CHANGE THE PLAY CALL, CERTAINLY.
&gt;&gt; Rod: YEAH, A LITTLE BIT. &gt;&gt; Jason: SOUTHERN MISS HAS
STRUGGLED WITH PENALTIES, 88th IN THE COUNTRY IN PENALTY
YARDAGE PER GAME. ALREADY FOUR TONIGHT.
CAN GET A FIRST DOWN AT THE 9. &gt;&gt; Rod: THEY'VE HAD A PROBLEM
WITH THIS GUY RIGHT THERE. HOW DO THEY PLAY HIM?
&gt;&gt; Rod: STAGGERS DOWN THE MIDDLE.
HE WANTED ROBERTSON. THAT'S FOURTH DOWN.
&gt;&gt; Rod: I THINK STAGGERED WAS THERE.
HE WAS MATCHED UP WITH A SAFETY DOWN THE MIDDLE, AND I THINK
THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE BETTER LOOK FOR MULLENS.
WELL, SOUTHERN MISS IS A TEAM THAT'S BEEN RATTLED BY INJURIES.
PARKER SHAUNFIELD MISSED THE FINAL THREE GAMES WITH AN
INJURY. HE IS BACK NOW AND HAS HAD A
VERY NICE SEASON WHEN HE'S BEEN HEALTHY.
BUT STRUGGLED A LITTLE BIT IN PREPARATION HERE IN THE
SUPERDOME. HIGH SNAP.
38 YARDER IS NO GOOD. AND THAT IS A STRONG JOB BY THE
DEFENSE FOR THE RAGIN' CAJUNS. STILL 14-7 AFTER THE MISS.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; WHEN YOU'RE IN NEW ORLEANS, YOU GOT TO EAT YOUR WAY THROUGH
THE CITY, WHICH IS WHAT QUINT KESSENICH DID, AND A COUPLE OF
PLAYERS FROM THE GAME AT A LOCAL RESTAURANT THIS WEEK.
&gt;&gt; Quint: WE ARE LEARNING A LOT ABOUT LOUISIANA SEAFOOD.
&gt;&gt; RIGHT. RIGHT OF PASSAGE TODAY IS HOW TO
SUCK AN OYSTER. EVERYBODY'S GOT CHOICES IN FRONT
OF THEM. &gt;&gt; Quint: THE HOME GROWN,
LOUISIANA PRODUCT. HE'S HANDLED THESE.
&gt;&gt; A LITTLE BIT. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO REPRESENT.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Quint: HE'S A SOUTH PAW FROM
MISSISSIPI. &gt;&gt; I'LL BE THE BACKUP.
&gt;&gt; GO. &gt;&gt; MAN, IF Y'ALL WANT TO DO
SOMETHING AFTER THE GAME, YOU CAN COME SHUCK SOME OYSTERS.
&gt;&gt; I'M TELLING YOU. &gt;&gt; AWESOME. &gt;&gt; Jason: I HAVE TO SAY, WELL
DONE BY Q. HE WAS THE WINNER THERE.
&gt;&gt; Rod: I'M STILL LOOKING AT THE OYSTERS.
&gt;&gt; Jason: WELL DONE, Q. &gt;&gt; Quint: THE MENU AT THAT
RESTAURANT WAS INSANE. FROM FARM TO TABLE, VOTED THE
BEST IN LOUISIANA FROM THE SEA AND LAKE TO TABLE, AS WELL.
JUST CRAZY STUFF. &gt;&gt; Jason: WE WILL SEE LATER IN
THE GAME YOUR DEMOLITION OF SOME OF THAT FOOD.
DION RAY IS KNOCKED DOWN SHORTLE OF THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE BY
SHERROD RUFF. WE WILL SEE A COUPLE MORE
INSTALLMENTS OF Q THERE, LEARNING TO COOK AND LEARNING
VERY WELL, MIGHT I ADD, TO EAT. &gt;&gt; Rod: IT'S ONE THING YOU DO
WHEN YOU COME HERE. THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF GOOD
FOOD. &gt;&gt; Jason: HOW ARE THERE SCALES
IN THIS CITY? &gt;&gt; Rod: MY GOODNESS.
&gt;&gt; Jason: JENNINGS, SECOND DOWN. HE IS AMBUSHED AGAIN!
JA'BOREE POOLE HAS LIVED ON ANTHONY JENNINGS.
&gt;&gt; Rod: IT SHOULDN'T BE A SURPRISE.
HE WAS LINED UP OVER A RECEIVER. JUST A SPEED RUSH.
NO ONE FINDS HIM. THEY ARE HAVING ONE HECK OF A
TIME. KUDOS TO SOUTHERN MISS FOR
SWITCHING UP HOW THEY BRING THEIR PRESSURES.
&gt;&gt; Jason: FOURTH SACK. POOLE HAS THREE OF THEM.
IT'S A RUN FOR JORDAN WRIGHT, WHO IS NOT GETTING MUCH OF
ANYTHING, JUST GETTING SOME ROOM TO PUNT WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN IN
TERMS OF HOW THEY CHANGE THOSE PRESSURES?
&gt;&gt; Rod: WELL, THEY LINED POOLE UP OVER THE SLOT RECEIVER, AND
STILL BROUGHT HIM FROM THAT EDGE.
HIS FIRST COUPLE OF SACKS, HE HAD HIS HAND AND THE GROUND AS A
DEFENSIVE END. AND THEN CAME AROUND THE EDGE,
ONCE FROM THE INSIDE, ONCE FROM THE OUTSIDE.
SO, THEY ARE MOVING HIM AROUND. AND A LOT OF THAT IS BECAUSE OF
BRADLEY. THERE'S SO MUCH PREOCCUPATION
WITH BRADLEY THAT POOLE IS HAVING A HUGE GAME.
&gt;&gt; Jason: COUTTS TO PUNT. STAGGERS WAVES THE FAIR CATCH
INSIDE THE 40 YARD LINE. OFFENSE HAS SLOWED SOME.
THE DEFENSES ARE OWNING THE SECOND QUARTER.
14-7, MULLENS AND THE GOLDEN EAGLES OUT NEXT.</description>

      <description>ON A COUPLE BIG PLAYS TO LEAD
14-7 IN THE SECOND QUARTER. THIS R+L CARRIERS NEW ORLEANS
BOWL. &gt;&gt; Rod: THIS GOES BACK TO THE
FIRST QUARTER. TROUBLE ON THE BACK END.
JUST WATCH, OU'LL SEE CRAWFORD, THE SAFETY, MOVE INSIDE.
STAGGERS IS IN THE SLOT, AND HE GETS MATCHED UP WITH LIGHTFOOT,
THE LINEBACKER. THAT IS A MISMATCH.
THIS IS COMPLETELY THE WAY SOUTHERN MISS WANTS IT.
DOWN THE FIELD, WIDE OPEN. NOW WATCH AGAIN.
A LITTLE BIT OF MOTION, WITH ALLEN, ACROSS THE FIELD.
CRAWFORD COMING UP. AGAIN, YOU HAVE LIGHTFOOT, THE
LINEBACKER, LOOKING UP STAGGERS. STAGGERS RUNS RIGHT BY HIM.
NO ONE CATCHES HIM. AND DARE I SAY, STAGGERS,
STAGGERING THE LOUISIANA-LAFAYETTE DEFENSE?
&gt;&gt; Jason: STAGGERING NUMBERS, TOO.
&gt;&gt; Rod: THAT WORKS, TOO. &gt;&gt; Jason: A GAME EARLIER THIS
YEAR, HE HAD SIX CATCHES FOR 292 YARDS AND THREE TOUCHDOWNS
AGAINST RICE. THE BIG PLAY MAN FOR SOUTHERN
MISS. KEEP IT ON THE GROUND ON FIRST
DOWN. AND NOT A LOT THERE.
SECOND DOWN. YOU LOOK AT THIS
LOUISIANA-LAFAYETTE DEFENSE, AND IT'S UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT.
THE DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR REPLACED MELVIN SMITH AFTER ONE
GAME THIS SEASON. LUCAS, A FORMER DEFENSIVE COD
NAY OR THE IN HIS OWN RIGHT. HAD TO INSTALL HIS OWN SYSTEM IN
ABOUT FOUR DAYS.  ANOTHER OPEN MAN AND ANOTHER
FIRST DOWN AND ANOTHER CATCH FOR STAGGERS.
&gt;&gt; Rod: WELL, AGAIN, HE GETS MATCHED UP ONE-ON-ONE WITH THE
SAFETY, TRAVIS CRAWFORD. HE'S IN THE SLOT THERE.
THAT THIRD RECEIVER IN. AND HE JUST WORKS THEM ON AN
OUT-ROUTE. I MEAN, RIGHT NOW, THEY DON'T
HAVE AN ANSWER. I DON'T THINK YOU CAN PLAY IN
MAN COVERAGE IF YOU'RE A SAFETY. YOU'RE GOING HAVE TO ZONE, PLAY
IN AND OUT OR SOMETHING. BUT RIGHT NOW, THAT IS A HUGE
PROBLEM. &gt;&gt; Jason: AGAINST A DEFENSE
THAT'S TOP 50 IN SCORING DEFENSE UNDER LUCAS, WHO REPLACED SMITH
AFTER ONE WEEK IN A LOSS TO BOISE STATE.
MULLENS. TRYING TO FIND TEZ PARTS.
THE IDEA WAS, IT WAS SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE BUBBLING, BUT
THAT'S STILL -- &gt;&gt; Rod: WELL, THE NUMBERS FROM
THAT BOISE STATE GAME WERE JUST RIDICULOUS.
35 FIRST HALF POINTS. ALMOST 600 TOTAL YARDS OF
OFFENSE. SO, CLEARLY, IT'S SOMETHING THAT
THEY WERE THINKING ABOUT LAST SEASON, DURING THE OFFSEASON,
AND THEN, WHEN THEY DIDN'T PLAY WELL AGAINST BOISE STATE, THEY
PULLED THE TRIGGER, MADE THE CHANGE.
&gt;&gt; Jason: SECOND DOWN FOR SOUTHERN MISS.
ITO SMITH. AND NOW THIRD DOWN COMING UP.
AND PART OF THE REASON FOR THAT IS, BOISE STATE IS SOMETHING TO
AIM FOR FOR GROUP OF FIVE TEAMS. LOUISIANA-LAFAYETTE AND MARK
HUDSPETH FEEL LIKE THEY COULD BE THAT TYPE OF PROGRAM.
&gt;&gt; Rod: WELL, A GOOD STEP FOR THEM NOW WOULD BE A STOP ON THIS
THIRD AND SHORT. YOU KNOW, THEY'RE RIGHT BACK IN
THIS BALL GAME, AND YOU GET A STOP, YOU GET THE BALL BACK, YOU
HAVE A SHOT. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT BOISE STATE.
THAT'S -- THAT'S A TALL CLIMB TO GET TO THAT PROGRAM'S STATURE.
&gt;&gt; Jason: BACK TO A BOWL GAME AFTER FOUR STRAIGHT FOR THE
RAGIN' CAJUNS. THIRD AND 11.
MULLENS. BALL COMES LOOSE!
AND IT'S PICKED UP BY THE RAGIN' CAJUNS.
PETERS, AFTER LIGHTFOOT PUNCHED IT OUT.
&gt;&gt; Rod: JASON, IT'S THE FIRST TIME THEY GOT REAL PRESSURE ON
MULLENS. AND WE TALKED ABOUT THE ISSUES
AT RIGHT TACKLE AND LEFT TACKLE, AND THIS TIME, THEY BROUGHT THE
PRESSURE ON THE RIGHT TACKLE'S SIDE.
THEY GET FREE. THERE'S LIGHTFOOT. STRIPPING THE BALL.
AND PETERS, HIS RUNNING MATE AND LINEBACKER, PICKS IT UP.
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, LOUISIANA-LAFAYETTE IS RIGHT
BACK IN THIS THING, WITH THE BALL INSIDE THE 30.
A CHANCE TO TIE THE GAME UP. &gt;&gt; Jason: WE TALKED ABOUT HOW
IMPORTANT TURNOVERS ARE TO THIS SOUTHERN MISS TEAM.
&gt;&gt; Quint: WELL, THEY ARE GIVEN THE BALL AWAY 31 TIMES NOW THIS
SEASON. THAT'S THEIR 16th FUMBLE.
THEY'VE THROWN 15 PICKS. THEY ARE SECOND TO LAST IN THE
FBS, IN THE NATION, IN TURNOVER MARGIN.
&gt;&gt; Jason: TIED WITH PURDUE FOR THE WORST IN THE COUNTRY.
RILES, REVERSING FIELD. HAS SOME ROOM.
AND HE'S INSIDE THE 30. AND A FLAG COMES IN ON SOME
CLOSE PLAY ACTIVITY AGAIN. &gt;&gt; Rod: LATE HIT ON THE
SIDELINE. &gt;&gt; Jason: IT WAS POOLE, IT
LOOKED LIKE, ON THE SIDELINE. HE'S HITTING EVERYTHING THAT
MOVES RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; Rod: I THINK ANTOINE HAD MADE
THE PLAY ALREADY, FORCING RILES OUT OF BOUNDS.
THEY'RE MAKING SURE THEY'RE GETTING THIS RIGHT.
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS, AS TO WHETHER -- WHETHER IT WAS A
LATE HIT AND I THINK THEY AGREE THAT IT IS.
&gt;&gt; Referee: PERSONAL FOUL, UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS, DEFENSE,
NUMBER 37. HALF THE DISTANCE TO THE GOAL,
FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; Jason: THEY GET IT ON SHERROD
RUFF. THAT MAY HAVE BEEN OFF THE BALL,
ROD. &gt;&gt; Rod: COULD HAVE BEEN.
CERTAINLY IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS ANTOINE THAT MADE THE TACKLE,
FORCING RILES OUT, AND I THOUGHT -- YOU WERE RIGHT, I
THOUGHT IT WAS POOLE WHO CAMEN LATE.
&gt;&gt; Jason: DION RAY HAS COME IN TO PLAY QUARTERBACK, THE
FRESHMAN, WHO IS PRIMARILY THE RUNNING QUARTERBACK.
FOR LOUISIANA-LAFAYETTE. RAY WILL RUN.
STRAIGHT UP THE MIDDLE -- INTO THE END ZONE!
&gt;&gt; Rod: HEY, JASON. WATCH THE PRESSURES AND WATCH
THE WAY McGUIRE HANDLES THIS. SOUTHERN MISS BRINGS THE BLITZ.
McGUIRE SEES IT, GETS A BREAK BLOCK INSIDE.
SPRINGS RAY FOR THE TOUCHDOWN RUN.
TALK ABOUT AN ALL-AROUND BACK THERE.
&gt;&gt; Jason: HE WAS LEADING JENNINGS IN ON THE EARLIER
TOUCHDOWN. EXTRA POINT IS GOOD.
AND SUDDENLY, WE ARE TIED -- BUT A FLAG HAS COME IN ON THE POINT
AFTER. THE CELEBRATION CONTINUES, FLAG
OR NO FLAG. &gt;&gt; Referee: OFFSIDE.
DEFENSE, NUMBER 37. PENALTY IS DECLINED.
THE EXTRA POINT IS GOOD. TIME-OUT.
&gt;&gt; Jason: SO, THE RAGIN' CAJUN DEFENSE CREATES A TURNOVER FROM
MULLENS, WITH SOME PRESSURE. PETERS, THE RECOVERY, AND THEN
RAY TO THE END ZONE. WE ARE TIED IN NEW ORLEANS.</description>

      <description>IN 2000 THE AUGUSTA SPORTS
COUNCIL IN AUGUSTA, GEORGIA, CREATED THE RAY GUY AWARD TO
HONOR THE NATION'S TOP COLLEGIATE PUNTER.
OFTENTIMES THE PUNTER HAS THE ABILITY TO CHANGE -- EXCUSE ME,
TO CHANGE THE GAME IN FAVOR OF HIS BROTHERS ON THE FIELD.
IT IS INCREDIBLY REWARDING TO HAVE MY NAME INSCRIBED ON THIS
AWARD. I AM ONCE AGAIN PRIVILEGED AND
HUMBLED TO PRESENT THIS SPECIAL AWARD TO THE NATION'S TOP
COLLEGIATE PUNTER. âªâª
&gt;&gt; WISHNOWSKY IS ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE OUTSTANDING AUSSIES.
&gt;&gt; WHAT A PUNT. &gt;&gt; HE SKIES THIS ONE.
&gt;&gt; WHAT A PUNT AGAIN BY JOHNSTON.
&gt;&gt; BEAUTIFULLY EXECUTED BY CAMERON JOHNSTON.
&gt;&gt; MICHAEL DICKSON, THE PUNTER FOR TEXAS.
HE'S HAVING AN OUTSTANDING GAME. &gt;&gt; HE GETS OFF A GREAT PUNT.
&gt;&gt; WHEN HE GETS INTO IT, THERE'S NO TELLING HOW FAR HE CAN KICK
THE BALL. &gt;&gt; ON BEHALF OF THE AUGUSTA
SPORTS COUNCIL, I AM PROUD TO PRESENT THE 2016 RAY GUY AWARD
TO MITCH WISHNOWSKY, UTAH. &gt;&gt; MITCH WISHNOWSKY IS THE
SECOND UTAH PLAYER TO WIN THE RAY GUY AWARD AND THE FIRST
SOPHOMORE TO WIN IT SINCE 2009. &gt;&gt; RAY, THANK YOU.
MITCH, CONGRATULATIONS. WE SPOKE TO YOU EARLIER.
YOU GET TO SHARE THIS WITH YOUR YOU THE TEAMMATES AND TWO OTHER
FINALISTS FROM YOUR HOME COUNTRY AND A LOT OF FOLKS THOUSANDS OF
MILES AWAY ARE WATCHING ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON.
&gt;&gt; YEP. OBVIOUSLY GOOD TO CAM AND DICK S
I PROMISED CHASE DOMINGUEZ NEEDS TO GET A SHOUTOUT.
HE SNAPPED TO TOM AND ME. THERE'S NO SNAPPER AWARD BUT I'M
NOMINATING CHASE FOR ONE. &gt;&gt; NEXT YEAR MAYBE.
DICKO MEANS DICKSON, RIGHT? &gt;&gt; SORRY, DICKSON.
&gt;&gt; WHAT DO PEOPLE NOT UNDERSTAND, BECAUSE AUSSIES AND
RUGBY PUNTERS HAVE BROUGHT MORE ATTENTION TO THE NUANCES.
YOU GUYS DO DIFFERENT THINGS. &gt;&gt; YEAH.
WELL, BY ROLLING OUT, YOU CAN HOLD ON TO IT FOR LONGER.
IT JUST OPENS UP THE GAME FOR A LITTLE BIT MORE.
SO IT IS CHANGING THE GAME OF COLLEGE FOOTBALL AS YOU'VE SEEN
FROM TOMMY THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND GUYS LIKE CAM.
&gt;&gt; THIS MEANS A LOT IN THE PUNTING COMMUNITY, IT WILL MEAN
A LOT IN AUSTRALIA. THERE ARE MORE AUSSIES DOWN
THERE, THEY ARE COMING FOR AMERICAN JOBS IN FOOTBALL.
MITCH, CONGRATULATIONS. &gt;&gt; CHRIS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
JOINED BY THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL FOUNDATION WINNER OF THE WILLIAM
V. CAMPBELL TROPHY AWARD, THIS IS A TROPHY GIVEN TO COLLEGE
FOOTBALL'S TOP SCHOLAR ATHLETE. IT'S QUITE AN AWARD AND WON THIS
YEAR BY WESTERN MITCH'S ZACK HARRELL AND WE'RE JOINED BY HIS
COACH, P.J. FLECK. ZACH ZACK, YOU GRADUATED IN
THREE AND A HALF YEARS AND YOU CARRY A 4.0 GPA WHILE YOU'RE
PURSUING AN MBA. I TALKED TO YOUR COACH BRIEFLY
LAST NIGHT AND ASKED A SIMPLE QUESTION.
JUST HOW SMART IS THIS GUY. P.J.?
&gt;&gt; EXTREMELY SMART. SMARTEST GUY I'VE EVER COACHED
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. SMART PLAYERS MAKE REALLY SMART
COACHES. VERY SIMPLE.
&gt;&gt; AND AS THE LEADER OF THIS FOOTBALL TEAM, LEADING IT INTO
OF COURSE THE NEW YEAR'S SIX IN THE COTTON BOWL, CONGRATULATIONS
ON A GREAT SEASON. YOU'VE ALSO DONE REMARKABLE
THINGS OUTSIDE THE LOCKER ROOM. A LOT OF THINGS CHARITABLY
INCLUDING YOUR WORK WITH TREE OF LIFE, A SCHOOL IN KALAMAZOO FOR
STUDENTS OF LOW INCOME. WHY THAT PURSUIT?
&gt;&gt; I THINK JUST BEING IN THE COMMUNITY AND ALL KALAMAZOO HAS
DONE FOR ME, GETTING TIED IN WITH THEM AND THE KIDS AND
SEEING THEIR FACES. BEING A LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOOD
AND GIVING THEM SOME HOPE. COACH FLECK EVEN WENT WITH ME TO
TALK TO THEM. A TREMENDOUS ORGANIZATION THAT'S
GIVING BACK AND IT'S FUN TO BE A PART OF THOSE KIDS' LIVES AND BE
A LIGHT FOR THEM. THEY GIVE SO MUCH MORE BACK TO
ME. IT'S A LOT OF FUN TO BE PART OF
THEM. &gt;&gt; ZACH REPRESENTING THE VERY,
VERY BEST O WHAT IS THE SPORT OF COLLEGE FOOTBALL.
CONGRATULATIONS ON A TREMENDOUS AWARD.
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU VERY MUCH.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; HERE TO PRESENT THE OUTLAND
TROPHY, THE 1994 RECIPIENT FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA, ZACK
WIEGERT. &gt;&gt; GOOD EVENING.
SINCE 1946, THE OUTLAND TROPHY HAS HONORED THE NATION'S BEST
INTERIOR LINEMAN. THAT OFFENSIVE OR DEFENSIVE
PLAYER HAS BEEN SELECTED BY THE FOOTBALL WRITERS ASSOCIATION OF
AMERICA AND FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS BEEN HONORED BY THE
GREATER OMAHA SPORTS COMMITTEE. I FEEL AS PROUD OF WINNING IT
TODAY AS I DID IN 1994. OFFENSIVE LINEMEN ARE GENERALLY
JUDGED ON ONE STATISTIC. WINS AND LOSSES.
THIS AWARD IS WON BECAUSE OF PEOPLE LIKE MY OFFENSIVE LINE
TEAMMATES. THIS AWARD IS WON BECAUSE OF
GREAT COACHES, MENTORS AND FRIENDS LIKE TOM OSBORNE WHO
DROVE US TO BE GREAT PEOPLE AND AFTER THAT FOOTBALL FALLS INTO
PLACE. TODAY THE TROPHY SITS ON THE
CORNER OF MY DESK IN MY HOME AS I REMINDER TO MY TWO CHILDREN
THAT DETERMINATION AND THE ABILITY TO WORK WITH OTHERS WILL
TAKE THEM FAR IN WHATEVER THEY MAY ENDEAVOR TO DO IN THEIR
LIVES. NOW LET'S MEET OUR FINALISTS.
âªâª &gt;&gt; 65, PAT ELFLEIN.
HE NEEDS A BUCKEYE STICKER ON THE SIDE OF HIS HELMET FOR THE
PANCAKE OUT IN FRONT. &gt;&gt; PAT ELFLEIN IS A CANDIDATE
FOR THE RIMINGTON AWARD AND THE BEST IN THAT POSITION.
âªâª &gt;&gt; A GREAT BLOCK BY CAM
ROBINSON. &gt;&gt; THE LEFT TACKLE GETTING OUT
IN SPACE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S A BIG MAN PULLING
AROUND. &gt;&gt; THE SPEED, HE'S MOVING VERY
QUICKLY. âªâª
&gt;&gt; IT IS MY HONOR TO INTRODUCE THE 71st WINNER OF THE OUTLAND
TROPHY, ROLL TIDE, CAM ROBINSON, ALABAMA.
&gt;&gt; CAM ROBINSON IS THE FOURTH TO WIN THE TROPHY AND THE THIRD
UNDER NICK SABAN. IT IS THE THIRD STRAIGHT SEASON
AN OFFENSIVE LINEMAN HAS WON THE OUTLAND TROPHY.
&gt;&gt; CAM, CONGRATULATIONS. YOU'VE GOT A VERY EXCITED
ALABAMA FANS. SHE'S READY FOR NEW YEAR'S EVE
RIGHT THERE. SHE'S WAITED ALL NIGHT FOR THIS
MOMENT. COME ON OVER HERE.
YOU HEARD THE VOICEOVER, THE FOURTH WINNER FROM YOUR SCHOOL
OF THIS AWARD, THE THIRD UNDER NICK SABAN.
ZACK MENTIONED THE PIPELINE. THE PIPELINE RESIDES IN
TUSCALOOSA. TALK ABOUT YOUR PRIDE OF
MAINTAINING THE TRADITION OF EXCELLENCE THERE.
&gt;&gt; I WAS AWARE THAT WE HAD A FEW GUYS BEFORE ME WIN THIS AWARD.
YOU KNOW, I WANTED TO KEEP THE TRADITION GOING.
IT'S A GREAT HONOR. I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO ANY OF
THIS WITHOUT GOD, YOU KNOW. HE'S BLESSED ME WITH GREAT
ATHLETIC ABILITY, AND MY MOM AND MY FAMILY AND MY SISTER WHO IS
HERE. I WANT TO THANK COACH SABAN FOR
GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY. &gt;&gt; AND HE WANTS TO THANK YOU FOR
GOING TO ALABAMA. THEY PLAYED 42 GAMES SINCE YOU
ARRIVED ON CAMPUS. YOU HAVE STARTED 42 GAMES.
YOU DON'T WALK INTO THE S.E.C. AND PLAY LEFT TACKLE FROM DAY
ONE. I KNOW YOU HAD HIGH EXPECTATIONS
FOR YOURSELF, BUT TALK ABOUT THE DRIVE TO IMPROVE.
YOU WERE PRETTY GOOD WHEN YOU GOT THERE.
&gt;&gt; WELL, SOMETHING COACH SABAN DRILLS INTO OUR HEAD IS NEVER
GET COMPLACENT AND NEVER BE SATISFIED.
THAT'S SOMETHING I'VE PRIDED MYSELF IN SINCE I WAS YOUNGER.
YOU ULTIMATELY WANT TO GET BETTER EACH AND EVERY YEAR.
&gt;&gt; ENJOY YOURSELF, HAPPY HOLIDAYS.
SEE YOU BACK HERE NEW YEAR'S EVE.
THE PLAYOFF AGAINST WASHINGTON. CAM ROBINSON, YOUR OUTLAND
TROPHY WINNER FROM ALABAMA.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; WELCOME BACK TO THE HOME
DEPOT COLLEGE FOOTBALL AWARDS FROM THE COLLEGE FOOTBALL HALL
OF FAME AND CHICK-FIL-A FAN EXPERIENCE IN ATLANTA.
OTHER NCFAA MEMBER AWARD WINNERS INCLUDE THE BUTKUS AWARD WINNER,
REUBEN FOSTER, ALABAMA. NOW PLEASE WELCOME THE MACKEY
AWARD WINNER, JAKE BUTT, MICHIGAN.
THE RIMINGTON TROPHY WINNER, PAT ELFLEIN, OHIO STATE.
AND THE WUERFFEL TROPHY WINNER, TREVOR KNIGHT, TEXAS A&amp;M.
&gt;&gt; HERE TO PRESENT THE WALTER KEMP ALL AMERICA TEAM, A MEMBER
OF THE 1992 AND '93 TEAMS AND NOTRE DAME GREAT, AARON TAYLOR.
&gt;&gt; WALTER CAMP IS KNOWN AS THE FATHER OF AMERICAN FOOTBALL.
AFTER PLAYING AT YALE, CAMP COACHED A HIS ALMA MATER IN THE
LATE 1880s AND LATER AT STANFORD.
HIS INNOVATIONS TO FOOTBALL BECAME INSTRUMENTAL IN FORMING
THE GAME THAT WE SEE TODAY. CAMP IS CREDITED WITH THE PLAY
FROM SCRIMMAGE, THE NUMERICAL ASSESSMENT OF GOALS, THE
RESTRICTION OF 11 MEN PER SIDE, SET PLAYS, AND A SYSTEM OF
DOWNS. WALTER CAMP SELECTED THE FIRST
ALL-AMERICAN TEAM IN 1889. TODAY THE WALTER CAMP
ALL-AMERICA TEAM IS ONE OF THE MOST RECOGNIZED AND PRESTIGIOUS
AWARDS IN COLLEGE FOOTBALL. HERE IS THIS YEAR'S TEAM.
&gt;&gt; THE 2016 WALTER CAMP ALL-AMERICA TEAM IS LED BY
LOUISVILLE QUARTERBACK, LAMAR JACKSON.
JOINING HIM IN THE BACKFIELD ARE TWO OF THE COUNTRY'S MOST
PROLIFIC RUNNING BACKS, DONNEL PUMPHREY FROM SAN DIEGO STATE
AND FLORIDA STATE'S DALVIN COOK. OKLAHOMA'S DEDE WESTBROOK AND
EAST CAROLINA'S ZAY JONES ARE THE TWO RECEIVERS ALONG WITH
TIGHT END JAKE BUTT FROM MICHIGAN.
JOINING THE OUTLAND TROPHY TRIO ON THE OFFENSIVE LINE ARE
FLORIDA STATE'S RODERICK JOHNSON AND CONNER WILLIAMS FROM TEXAS.
ON THE DEFENSIVE SIDE OF THE BALL, FLORIDA STATE'S DeMARCUS
WALKER AND TENNESSEE'S DERRICK BARNETT HEADLINE A STOUT
DEFENSIVE LINE. ALABAMA'S REUBEN FOSTER AND
VANDERBILT'S ZACH CUNNINGHAM ANCHOR THE LINEBACKERS.
OHIO STATE'S MALIK HOOKER JOINS THE JIM THORPE AWARD TRIO IN THE
SECONDARY. ROUNDING OUT THE WALTER CAMP
ALL-AMERICA TEAM ARE THE SPECIALISTS.
&gt;&gt; THERE ARE THE VIDEOS WE ALL REMEMBER FROM THIS YEAR AND THE
VIDEOS THAT SOME WOULD LIKE TO FORGET.
SOME ARE PLAYED OUT AND SOME WE CAN'T PLAY ENOUGH.
THEY ARE THE VIRAL MOMENTS FROM THE 2016 FOOTBALL SEASON.
TAKE A LOOK. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE DIAMONDS.
GO BE DIAMONDS TONIGHT. I LOVE YOU, I'M PROUD OF YOU, BE
HUMBLE, BE CONFIDENT, PLAY FOR EACH OTHER AND BE THE DIAMONDS I
KNOW YOU ARE. LET'S GO!
&gt;&gt; IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT. WHO'S HOUSE?
&gt;&gt; OUR HOUSE. &gt;&gt; WHOSE HOUSE?
&gt;&gt; OUR HOUSE. âªâª
&gt;&gt; I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU ABOUT LAMONT JACKSON BUT I JUST FEEL
DISTRACTED. âªâª
&gt;&gt; LOOK AT THIS FORMATION. WHAT DO YOU CALL THIS?
&gt;&gt; OH, REMEMBER ONE OF THE GREAT ENTRANCES OF ALL TIME.
&gt;&gt; LEWIS AT THE 5. LEWIS GETS CRUSHED AND IT WAS
THE KICKER WHO MADE THE HIT. &gt;&gt; PLEASE REFRAIN FROM SHOOTING
LASERS ONTO THE FIELD. THANK YOU.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S MY WIFE. I'LL GET RIGHT BACK TO HIM AT
THE PRESS CONFERENCE. SHE SAID BRING A GALLON OF MILK
HOME ON THE WAY HOME. âªâª
&gt;&gt; HERE TO PRESENTING THE CHUCK BEDNARIK AWARD, A TWO-TIME
ALL-AMERICAN FROM THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY AND SUPER BOWL
CHAMPION, A.J. HAWK. &gt;&gt; THE COLLEGE DEFENSIVE PLAYER
OF THE YEAR IS NAMED FOR THE LEGENDARY DEFENDER, CHUCK
BEDNARIK, WHO WAS THE ULTIMATE FOOTBALL GUY.
AFTER FLYING 30 MISSIONS AS A GUNNER IN GERMANY DURING WORLD
WAR II, CHUCK ATTENDED PENN. THEN WENT ON TO PLAY 14 SEASONS
IN THE NFL, MISSING ONLY THREE GAMES IN WHICH HE WAS NAMED
ALL-PRO EIGHT TIMES. IT IS APPROPRIATE THAT THE
DEFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE YEAR BE NAMED AFTER THE NFL'S LAST
60-MINUTE MAN WHO PLAYED FULL TIME BOTH WAYS.
TO RISE ABOVE ALL THE REST AND BE NAMED THE NATION'S BEST
DEFENDER IS AN INCREDIBLE HONOR THAT I AM PROUD TO GIVE TONIGHT.
HERE ARE THE FINALISTS. âªâª
&gt;&gt; JONATHAN ALLEN SHOULD BE ADDED TO THE HEISMAN LIST.
&gt;&gt; IT'S JONATHAN ALLEN. HE'S GOING TO TAKE IT FOR THE
SECOND TOUCHDOWN OF THE YEAR. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN ALLEN, HE CAME
SHOOTING THROUGH AND OVER TOP OF EVERYBODY BEFORE KNIGHT EVEN
KNEW WHAT HIT HIM. &gt;&gt; WATCH HOW FAST HE JUMPS.
THERE'S NO CHANCE FOR THE LEFT TACKLE.
&gt;&gt; HOW BILLION MYLES GARRETT MAKING HIS PRESENCE KNOWN?
&gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW THE RIGHT DEFENSIVE END IS THE BEST PLAYER
IN COLLEGE FOOTBALL. &gt;&gt; JABRILL PEPPERS FOR THE
HEISMAN SHOULD BE ON EVERYBODY'S SHORT LIST.
&gt;&gt; NOBODY IN THIS COUNTRY ON ANY FOOTBALL TEAM IS MORE IMPORTANT.
&gt;&gt; HE IS, MR. EVERYTHING OR #SWISSARMYKNIFE.
&gt;&gt; IT IS AN HONOR TO PRESENT THE 22nd WINNER OF THE MAXWELL
FOOTBALL CLUB'S CHUCK BEDNARIK AWARD TO JONATHAN ALLEN FROM
ALABAMA. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN ALLEN IS THE FIRST
PLAYER FROM ALABAMA AND FOURTH FROM THE S.E.C. TO WIN THE BED
NARIC AWARD. &gt;&gt; JONATHAN, CONGRATULATIONS.
YOUR TIDE FAN BACK HERE WAS EXCITED.
BACK-TO-BACK TROPHIES FOR BAMA. ALABAMA FANS LIKE THE SOUND OF
THAT IN A BIGGER CONTEXT. THE FIRST FROM YOUR SCHOOL.
OF ALL THE GREAT PLAYERS. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO YOU?
&gt;&gt; IT'S A TREMENDOUS HONOR. WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL THE GUYS
THAT CAME BEFORE ME AND PAVED THE PATH FOR ME TO COME THROUGH,
IT'S A LONG LIST. TO BE IN THE SAME LIGHT WITH THE
THOSE THAT HAVE WON, IT'S A TREMENDOUS HONOR.
I WANT TO THANK GOD, MY FAMILY, COACH SABAN FOR TURNING ME FROM
A BOY INTO A MAN, MY GIRLFRIEND, MY GRAND MAMA, EVERYBODY WHO'S
HAD A PART IN MY GLOWING UP, SO THANK YOU.
&gt;&gt; YOU REACHED THE PINNACLE LAST YEAR.
WHAT'S BEEN THE MOST REWARDING THING ABOUT RETURNING FOR YOUR
SENIOR SEASON IN TUSCALOOSA. &gt;&gt; JUST COMING BACK AND BEING A
MORE COMPLETE PLAYER, SHOWING THAT I CAN PLAY EVERY DOWN AND
BE MORE VERSATILE AND IMPORTANT TO MY TEAM.
&gt;&gt; COMPETITION HAPPENS A LOT IN PRACTICE, DEFENSE VERSUS
OFFENSE. YOU SAID IT'S THE GOAL OF
YOURSELF AND THE DEFENSE TO GET COACH SABAN TO YELL AT LANE
KIFFIN, THE OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR.
DO YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN WHAT THAT MEANS?
&gt;&gt; COACH KIFFIN, HE'S A GOOD GUY, YOU KNOW.
HE TRIES, SO AS A DEFENSE WE HAVE A PERSONAL MISSION TO GET
COACH SABAN TO CHEW HIM OUT. IT FEELS GOOD WHEN YOU CAN DO
THAT. &gt;&gt; IT IS SOMETHING TO SEE THOSE
ALABAMA PRACTICES. THERE'S NO DOUBT WHY THEY'RE IN
THIS POSITION YEAR AFTER YEAR, JONATHAN ALLEN BEDNARIK AWARD
WINNER, WE'LL SEE YOU BACK IN</description>

NOW ON BEHALF OF THE MAXWELL FOOTBALL CLUB, WHOSE MEMBERS

JACKSON ALSO WON THE WALTER CAMP PLAYER OF THE YEAR AWARD EARLIER
THIS EVENING. &gt;&gt; LAMAR, CONGRATULATIONS.
IT HAS BEEN A BIG EVENING FOR YOU.
THE WALTER CAMP PLAYER OF THE YEAR AND NOW PRESTIGIOUS MAXWELL
AWARD. WE WERE TALKING LAST NIGHT.
YOUR JOURNEY FROM STREET FOOTBALL AGAINST OLDER, MUCH
BIGGER AND TOUGHER COUSINS WHO TRIED TO KNOCK YOU DOWN ONTO THE
POMPANO EAGLES DOWN THERE IN SOUTH FLORIDA.
WHAT HAS BEEN THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT HAS SHAPED YOUR
JOURNEY FROM THERE TO THIS STAGE?
&gt;&gt; I HAVE TO GIVE ALL MY CREDIT TO MY MOTHER.
SHE HELPED ME OUT, BUILD ME FROM COMING UP AS A YOUNG GUY, YOU
KNOW. I WAS KIND OF -- YOU KNOW, SHE
JUST -- I DON'T KNOW, MAN, SHE'S A GREAT MOTHER.
SHE'S LIKE A FATHER FIGURE. SHE LED ME AND HELPED ME OUT A
LOT, TREMENDOUS, SO I'M BLESSED. &gt;&gt; THERE'S SO MANY GREAT
FOOTBALL MOMS WHO HAVE CREATED STORIES LIKE YOURS.
YOU WERE TELLING ME LAST NIGHT, THOUGH, BECAUSE NOT MANY HAVE
DONE THIS, SHE PUT ON THE SHOULDER PADS, TOOK YOU DOWN IN
THE BACKYARD, TRAINED YOU, HILT YOU HARD TO GET YOU READY FOR
COMPETITIVE FOOTBALL. &gt;&gt; YEAH.
SHE SEEN ME OVERPOWER MY LITTLE BROTHER AND SHE SAID YOU SHOULD
DO IT TO ME. I SAID YOU'RE A LADY, I CAN TAKE
YOU. SHE KNOCKED ME OUT.
&gt;&gt; THEY HAD A HARD TIME CATCHING YOU TO KNOCK YOU OUT IN THIS
SPECTACULAR SEASON AS A PASSER AND A RUNNER.
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO THE FOLKS THAT HELPED YOU GET
HERE FROM THE LOUISVILLE CARDINALS.
YOU'RE MAKING SOME HISTORY FOR THE PROGRAM WITH SOME OF THESE
AWARDS. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO THANK THE LORD,
JESUS CHRIST MY PERSONAL SAVIOR. WITHOUT HIM NONE OF US WOULD BE
HERE TONIGHT. I LOVE THE FANS AND MY
TEAMMATES. THEY'RE PROUD OF ME, I'M PROUD
OF THEM, THE SUCCESS, AND I LOVE THE COACH.
HE LET ME LEAD HIS TEAM AND I'M JUST HAPPY RIGHT NOW, IT'S
CRAZY. &gt;&gt; AND NOW, LAMAR, ALONG WITH
FOUR OTHER GUYS HERE TONIGHT HEAD TO NEW YORK AS HEISMAN
TROPHY FINALISTS ON AGAIN.
GODSPEED, JOHN GLENN. LISA: YES, IT IS.
WELCOME INTO THE PARTY, PEOPLE. I'M LISA KERNEY.
HE IS JOHN ANDERSON. AND THAT BARBECUE IN KANSAS
CITY HAS NEVER SMELLED SO GOOD. THOSE RED LIGHTS ON THE PLAZA
HAVE NEVER SHINED SO BRIGHT. ON THURSDAY NIGHT.
JOHN: YOU ARE A HOMER. LISA: WHAT HAPPENED?
I'M JUST TALKING ABOUT -- JOHN: CHIEFS-RAIDERS DESPISING
EACH OTHER SINCE 196 THE CHIEFS, WON IN OAKLAND THE LAST
TIME THE RAIDERS LOST GAME. DEREK CARR, 1-4 IN HIS CAREER
AGAINST THE CHEFS. THIS TIME WE ARE AT LOVELY
ARROWHEAD STADIUM. WHAT YOU CAN'T SEE IN THAT
PICTURE IT WAS COLD. TYREEK HILL MAKING PLAYS FOR
THE CHIEFS EARLY. THEY'RE TRAILING 3-0.
BUT THEY HAD A BIG SECOND QUARTER.
ALEX SMITH, FIRES THE MAGIC BEAN.
HILL'S GOT IT. 36-YARD PITCH-AND-CATCH AND
THIS IS WHAT YOU JUST SEE. THE GUYS IN RED FASTER THAN THE
GUY IN WHITE AND YOU GET A TOUCHDOWN.
CHIEFS UP 7-3. HILL.
OH, HE'S MORE. HE'S BACK TO RECEIVE THE PUNT.
IT'S 14-3 CHIEFS. &gt;&gt; THE CROWD CHANTING TYREKE,</description>

      <description>YOU KNOW, MY O-LINE THEY DID
EVERYTHING I COULD TO MAKE SURE I KEPT MY RECORD AND DID
EVERYTHING I COULD TO HELP THE TEAM WIN.
I THANK THOSE GUYS SO MUCH AND MY FAMILY FOR THE SUPPORT.
&gt;&gt; THINGS DIDN'T WORK OUT THE WAY THE LONGHORNS HOMELAND BUT
YOU CONTINUED TO SHOW UP EVERY PRACTICE AND EVERY GAME AND RUN
WITH ENERGY AND PASSION. YOU WORE IT ON YOUR SLEEVE.
WHERE DID THE STRENGTH TO DO THAT, EVEN THOUGH THE SEASON IS
NOT GOING YOUR WAY AS A TEAM? &gt;&gt; I MEAN I TOLD MYSELF BEFORE
THE SEASON THAT I WANTED TO BE A LEADER OF THAT TEAM.
NO MATTER WHAT. AND THE LEADERS DON'T QUIT, YOU
KNOW. WHEN YOU'RE A LEADER OF A TEAM,
YOU CAN'T QUIT, WHETHER YOU'RE WINNING OR LOSING.
YOU'VE GOT TO GO OUT THERE WHETHER IT'S PRACTICE OR A GAME
AND GIVE IT YOUR ALL, AND THAT'S WHAT I DID.
&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE A UNIQUE SITUATION. YOUR TWIN BROTHER ALSO A
TEAMMATE WITH THE LONGHORNS. YOU GUYS HAVE A FRIENDLY
COMPETITION. YOU SHARED WITH ME A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT THAT LAST NIGHT. NOW YOU CAN SHARE THIS WITH HIM.
&gt;&gt; ME AND HIM BEEN COMPETING OUR WHOLE LIFES.
HE CAME IN WITH THE MOST STARS BUT I LOVE HIM TO DEATH.
HE'S SO PROUD OF ME, I'M SO PROUD OF HIM.
I'M GLAD THAT I COULD BRING THIS HOME FOR ME AND HIM.
IT'S NOT ONLY FOR ME, IT'S FOR ME AND HIM, MY FAMILY AND MY
TEXAS FAMILY. &gt;&gt; CONGRATULATIONS, GO ON DOWN
THERE AND SHARE THE LOVE WITH THOSE GUYS.
THE WINNER OF THE DOAK WALKER AWARD, D'ONTA FOREMAN.
HE HAS DECLARED FOR THE DRAFT AND WE WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK
GOING FORWARD.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; WHILE WE RECOGNIZE THE GREAT
SEASON OF D'ONTA AND THE OTHER FINALISTS, WE ALSO PAUSE TO
REFLECT AND REMEMBER A MAN WHO WON THIS AWARD 22 YEARS AGO AND
WENT ON TO WIN THE HEISMAN TROPHY A SHORT TIME AFTER THAT
IN 1994. ON BEHALF OF THE DOAK WALKER
FAMILY, THE AWARD, ALL OF US HERE, OUR DEEPEST CONDOLENCES,
OUR THOUGHTS, OUR PRAYERS TO THE FAMILY OF RASHAAN SALAAM.
WE LOST RASHAAN THIS WEEK. WE LOST HIM FAR TOO EARLY AT 42.
ON BEHALF OF MIKE MacINTYRE AND ENTIRE COLORADO BUFFALO
ORGANIZATION, AS A FELLOW BUFF, I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE ARE
HURTING. WE'RE DEEPLY SADDENED.
RASHAAN HAD A 2,000-YARD SEASON, NFL ROOKIE OF THE YEAR BEFORE
INJURIES CUT SHORT HIS CAREER. IT'S NOT THE RECORDS OR THE
AWARDS. I THINK OF RASHAAN'S SMILE WHEN
I THINK OF HIM. IT WAS HUGE, IT WAS
ENTHUSIASTIC. YOU WANTED TO MAKE HIM SMILE THE
BIGGEST. YOU WOULD ASK HIM ABOUT HIS
TEAMMATES. HE LOVED HIS TEAMMATES.
IT WAS MUTUAL. AND HE WAS AND WILL ALWAYS
REMAIN A GREAT BUFF. BUT AS WE DO HERE, WE DRAW
STRENGTH FROM EACH OTHER WHEN WE NEED IT.
AND WE MOVE FORWARD. WE WILL CONTINUE TO HONOR THE
BEST IN COLLEGE FOOTBALL 2016.  AFTER THIS.
IN THE MEMORY OF RASHAAN.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; WELCOME BACK TO THE HOME
DEPOT COLLEGE FOOTBALL AWARDS. AND NOW HERE TO PRESENT THIS
YEAR'S HONOREE FOR THE NATIONAL COLLEGE FOOTBALL AWARDS
ASSOCIATION'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO COLLEGE FOOTBALL, 1996 HEISMAN
TROPHY WINNER, DANNY WUERFFEL. &gt;&gt; THIS PAINTING BACK HERE IS
REAL APPROPRIATE FOR OUR NEXT AWARD RECIPIENT.
HIGHLY UNCONVENTIONAL, BUT ONE OF A KIND.
THE CONTRIBUTION AWARD MEANS THE EFFORT THAT A PERSON MAKES, THE
PART THEY PLAY IN TO HELP ADVANCE SOMETHING.
AND I MAY BE A LITTLE BIASED, BUT I CAN THINK OF NO ONE ELSE
MORE WORTHY OF THIS AWARD TONIGHT.
AS A PLAYER FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA, HE WON THE HEISMAN
TROPHY IN 1966. HE HAD AN INCREDIBLE COACHING
CAREER, INCLUDING WINNING THE ACC AT DUKE, GOING TO FLORIDA
AND IN HIS FIRST SEVEN YEARS WINNING THE S.E.C. CHAMPIONSHIP
SIX TIMES AS WELL AS OUR FIRST NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP.
GO GATORS! AND ALSO MOVING ON TO HAVING A
WONDERFUL CAREER, ITS WINNINGEST COACH EVER AT SOUTH CAROLINA.
BUT NOT JUST THE CONTRIBUTION TO THE PROGRAMS WHERE HE PLAYED,
THE INNOVATION HE BROUGHT TO FOOTBALL THAT CHANGED THE WAY
THE GAME IS PLAYED AND ALL THE FUN WE SEE CAN SO OFTEN BE
ATTRIBUTED TO THE WORK HE'S DONE OVER THE COURSE OF HIS LIFETIME.
BUT TO ME, A CONTRIBUTION ISN'T MEASURED SO MUCH BY WINS AND
LOSSES AS BOWLS AND CHAMPIONSHIPS, IT'S MEASURED BY
THE IMPACT YOU HAVE ON PEOPLE. AND I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THE
TRAJECTORY OF MY LIFE AND MANY COUNTLESS OTHERS HAVE BEEN
CHANGED BECAUSE WE HAD THE CHANCE TO PLAY FOR COACH STEVE
SPURRIER. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, JOIN ME IN
WATCHING THIS VIDEO TRIBUTE. &gt;&gt; NONE OF US IS ONE THING.
BUT FEW OF US ARE AS MANY THINGS AS STEVE SPURRIER.
&gt;&gt; WHAT KIND OF QUOTES DO YOU NEED TODAY?
&gt;&gt; OKAY, EVERYBODY READY? &gt;&gt; OF THE MANY, CONSIDER THREE.
FIRST, AN ON-FIELD COMPETITOR. AS A TWO-TIME ALL-AMERICAN
QUARTERBACK AT FLORIDA, SPURRIER ONCE WAVED OFF THE GATORS
STARTING PLACE KICKER TO BOOT A GAME-WINNING 40-YARD FIELD GOAL
HIMSELF. IN 1966, HE BECAME THE SCHOOL'S
FIRST HEISMAN TROPHY WINNER. &gt;&gt; WELL, I WAS VERY THANKFUL AND
GRATEFUL. I IMAGINE EVERY BOY HAS DREAMS
OF WINNING IT. &gt;&gt; NEXT, A SIDELINE INNOVATOR,
THE HEAD BALL COACH DID IT BY REJECTING A RUN FIRST BALL
CONTROL PHILOSOPHY FOR A PASS ORIENTED REVOLUTION KNOWN AS RUN
AND GUN. &gt;&gt; THE GATORS, CHAMPIONS FOUR
STRAIGHT OF THE SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE.
&gt;&gt; THE GATORS HAVE WON THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP!
&gt;&gt; BUT PERHAPS MOST, HE WAS A CONSTANT CHARACTER.
&gt;&gt; WE'RE HONORED AND THRILLED TO BE HERE AT THE NOKIA SUGAR BOWL.
THEY CERTAINLY MAKE A WONDERFUL PHONE.
&gt;&gt; OUR KICKERS, IT'S LIKE THE ARMY.
LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT. USUALLY WHEN THAT COACH UP THERE
TALKS ABOUT SOUTH CAROLINA, IT'S A BUNCH OF GARBAGE.
WE HAD A BIG WIN OVER THAT TEAM FROM THE UPSTATE AND WE WERE
ABLE TO BEAT WOFFORD 24-7. &gt;&gt; FROM THE VISOR TOSS TO THE
SUN GLASS STYLINGS, SPURRIER HAS BEEN MANY THINGS THAT NUMBERS
AND TITLES CAN NEVER DESCRIBE. PERHAPS THE NEWEST LABEL OF THEM
ALL -- &gt;&gt; HAVE YOU EVER HEARD A COACH
SAY THAT? &gt;&gt; ORIGINAL.
&gt;&gt; TRULY ONE OF A KIND. IT IS MY HONOR TO PRESENT THIS
YEAR'S NCFAA CONTRIBUTIONS OF COLLEGE FOOTBALL TO THE HEAD
BALL COACH, STEVE SPURRIER. &gt;&gt; THE 26 COLLEGE COACHING
CAREER STEVE SPURRIER'S TEAMS HAVE COMBINED FOR A TOTAL OF
SEVEN CONFERENCE TITLES, 11 BOWL WINS AND ONE NATIONAL
CHAMPIONSHIP. HE IS THE WINNINGEST COACH AT
BOTH FLORIDA AND SOUTH CAROLINA. &gt;&gt; FOR A GUY WHO GREW UP IN
TENNESSEE AND COACHED AT FLORIDA AND SOUTH CAROLINA, YOU GOT A
NICE CHEER IN GEORGIA. THAT'S SOMETHING SPECIAL, THAT'S
RARE. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE VERY NICE.
THEY'RE COLLEGE FOOTBALL FANS HERE AND CERTAINLY A SPECIAL
EVENING TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU ARE A COACH, YOU
DON'T HAVE MUCH CHANCE TO REFLECT, YOU LOOK FORWARD TO THE
NEXT BALL PLAY, THE NEXT GAME. NOW THAT YOU DO HAVE A CHANCE TO
REFLECT, DANNY SAID IT BEAUTIFULLY, WHAT YOU HAVE MEANT
TO THE SPORT. WHAT HAS THE SPORT OF COLLEGE
FOOTBALL MEANT TO YOU? &gt;&gt; FIRST OF ALL, CHRIS, I'M VERY
FORTUNATE JUST TO BE A COLLEGE COACH.
MY PATH IN LIFE IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN MOST OF THE OTHER
COACHES. TO BE IN THE NFL, I DON'T SAY I
PLAYED TEN YEARS BECAUSE I WAS A BACKUP QUARTERBACK FOR EIGHT,
BUT I WAS IN THERE FOR TEN YEARS.
THEN LUCKILY GOT INTO COLLEGE COACHING.
SOMEBODY HAD TO GIVE ME A JOB AND DOUG DICKIE HIRED ME AT
FLORIDA. WE DIDN'T WIN ENOUGH GAMES AND
PEPPER ROGERS CALLED ME ABOUT A MONTH AFTER I WAS OUT OF
COACHING COMPLETELY. I WAS ONE AND DONE BUT COACH
ROGERS KEPT ME ALIVE. WE DIDN'T WIN ENOUGH, WE GOT
FIRED AND THEN I GOT A CHANCE TO GO TO DUKE UNIVERSITY AND RED
WILSON, TOM BUTTERS THERE. SO I LOVE DUKE BECAUSE THEY
HIRED ME TWICE WHEN I HAD NO JOB.
THEN I WAS FORTUNATE, YOU KNOW, AFTER WE WON THERE AT DUKE TO
GET THE FLORIDA JOB WHERE I HAD ALL KIND OF BALLPLAYERS, TO
INHERIT A TEAM THAT I HAD, BEING AT THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT
TIME. I WAS VERY FORTUNATE.
&gt;&gt; I TALKED TO LEE CORSO AND HE TALKS ABOUT COACHING BEING A
CALLING. IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE WINS,
BUT YOU HAD DANNY WUERFFEL LIKE YOURSELF A HEISMAN TROPHY
WINNER, A GREAT EXAMPLE FOR ALL OF US, SUCH A ROLE MODEL.
WHAT'S IT MEANT TO MAKE AN IMPACT ON GUYS' LIVES AND SEE
THEM GO ON TO BECOME EXAMPLES? &gt;&gt; YEAH, COLLEGE FOOTBALL, IT'S
ALL ABOUT TEACHING TEAMWORK AND SO FORTH.
I KNOW WE'VE HEARD THAT SAYING THAT TEAMWORK IS THE FUEL THAT
ALLOWS COMMON PEOPLE TO ACHIEVE UNCOMMON RESULTS.
AND IF YOU'RE A GOOD TEAMMATE AND YOU'RE THE STAR PLAYER, THEN
YOUR TEAM HAS A CHANCE FOR CHAMPIONSHIPS AND BIG SEASONS.
AND OF COURSE DANNY AND SHANE MATTHEWS, THE GUYS I HAD AT
FLORIDA, THEY ALL LOVED EACH OTHER.
THEY'RE ALL WONDERFUL TEAMMATES. AND IF YOU'RE GOOD TEAMMATES,
YOU'RE GOING TO DO WELL IN LIFE BECAUSE YOU'RE PART OF A TEAM
AND WE ALL LOVE EACH OTHER AND KNOW HOW TO ACT AND SO FORTH.
&gt;&gt; IT'S A BIG WEEKEND, BESIDES THIS AWARD YOU HEAD TO NEW YORK.
IT'S THE 50th ANNIVERSARY OF STEVE'S HEISMAN TROPHY.
AND IT'S ALSO, I'M GOING TO EMBARRASS YOUR BEAUTIFUL, LOVY
WIFE, JERRI, IT'S ALSO YOUR 50th WEDDING ANNIVERSARY THIS YEAR,
SO CONGRATULATIONS. JERRI, THANK YOU FOR SHARING THE
HEAD BALL COACH WITH ALL OF US. &gt;&gt; A LOT OF 50s THIS YEAR,
CHRIS. &gt;&gt; DOES IT BOTHER YOU, AND I'VE
TALKED TO PLAYERS THAT JERRI WAS MUCH MORE POPULAR WITH THE
FLORIDA AND SOUTH CAROLINA PLAYERS THAN YOU EVER WERE.
DOES THAT STICK WITH YOUR CRAW? &gt;&gt; OUR PLAYERS GOT COOKIES ON
THEIR BIRTHDAY, SOUTH CAROLINA, DUKE, FLORIDA, EVERYWHERE I
WENT. SHE'S A BIG PART OF WHATEVER
SUCCESSIVE HAD CERTAINLY. &gt;&gt; AS EVERY COACH'S WIFE IS.
STEVE, CONGRATULATIONS. THRILLED FOR YOU.
STEVE SPURRIER, THE CONTRIBUTION TO COLLEGE FOOTBALL WINNER FOR
2016. LEE, KIRK.
&gt;&gt; AS CHRIS JUST MENTIONED, YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE KNOWN COACH
SPURRIER A LONG TIME. &gt;&gt; STEVE SPURRIER IS A GREAT
FOOTBALL COACH. HE WON AT DUKE, A BASKETBALL
SCHOOL. THEN HE WENT TO THE UNITED
STATES FOOTBALL LEAGUE AND WON THERE.
I KNOW, BECAUSE MY FIRST YEAR I WAS THE HEAD PRO COACH, HE BEAT
THE CRAP OUT OF ME AND THEN THE SECOND YEAR, HE WENT TO FLORIDA
AND HE WON. BUT ONE OF THE GREATEST YEARS HE
HAD WERE AT SOUTH CAROLINA. HE WON 11 GAMES THREE TIMES AT
SOUTH CAROLINA. AND NO ONE EVER DID THAT BEFORE.
I THINK HE'S A GREAT FOOTBALL COACH AND A GREAT MAN.
HE DESERVES THE HONOR AND I'M PROUD TO BE HIS FRIEND FOR ALL
THESE YEARS. &gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY.
AND I THINK FOR ME, I'VE BEEN ON COLLEGE GAMEDAY 21 YEARS.
ONE OF MY FIRST SHOWS ON THE ROAD WAS WHEN TENNESSEE AND
PEYTON MANNING WERE AT HOME WITH FLORIDA.
THIS IS WHEN PEOPLE DIDN'T GO FOR IT ON FOURTH DOWN.
AND DANNY WUERFFEL AND FLORIDA, LIKE FOURTH AND EIGHT AT
MIDFIELD. THEY GO FOR IT.
I THINK HE HIT IKE HILLIARD OR ANTHONY ON A POST FOR A
TOUCHDOWN. I REALLY THINK HE'S AN
INNOVATOR. THE FUN AND GUN WAS KIND OF
UNUSUAL AND TODAY IT'S VERY COMMON.
I THINK IT ALL GOES BACK TO STEVE SPURRIER.
&gt;&gt; NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. HE HAD THE COURAGE TO GO FOR IT
ALL THE TIME. HE'S A GREAT FOOTBALL -- BUT
MORE IMPORTANT, A GREAT HUMAN BEING.
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY.</description>

LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THEM. âªâª
&gt;&gt; THAT IS EVERY SAFETY'S NIGHTMARE.
&gt;&gt; TOUCHDOWN, DEDE WESTBROOK! &gt;&gt; THAT IS EXTREME ATHLETICISM.

DEDE, CONGRATULATIONS. WE TALKED LAST NIGHT.
YOUR JOURNEY IS SUCH A GREAT EXAMPLE OF PERSEVERANCE.
THIS GUY WAS BLESSED BORN FAST. BUT YOU'RE A 145-POUND SENIOR IN
A SMALL TOWN IN TEXAS. NOT MANY OFFERS TO END UP HERE
NAMED TOP RECEIVER IN THE COUNTRY.
WHAT ARE YOU MOST PROUD OF IN THAT JOURNEY?
&gt;&gt; JUST TO START OFF, MAN, I WANT TO THANK GOD.
WITHOUT HIM NONE OF THIS WOULD BE POSSIBLE.
AND WITH MY JOURNEY, MY BEAUTIFUL MOTHER.
SHE ALWAYS KEPT ME MOTIVATED. AT TIMES I FELT LIKE GIVING UP
AND I DIDN'T THINK THIS ROUTE WAS FOR ME, BUT SHE STAYED ON ME
AND KEPT PUSHING. &gt;&gt; WE TALKED ABOUT THOSE NIGHTS
IN JUNIOR COLLEGE WHICH IS A GRIND.
YOU HAVE TWO KIDS. ARE THEY WATCHING TONIGHT, DO
YOU THINK? &gt;&gt; YES, THEY'RE WATCHING.
&gt;&gt; AND FOR THEM YOU DECIDED TO GO AK AND PERSEVERE.
I ASKED YOU IF YOU WIN AN AWARD, WHO ARE YOU GOING TO THINK OF
AND YOU SAID RIGHT AWAY, THOSE TWO.
&gt;&gt; YES, MY CHILDREN, MY BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN AT HOME
WATCHING. AS SOON AS THE SHOW IS OVER
WITH, THEY BETTER BE IN BED BECAUSE THEY HAVE SCHOOL IN THE
MORNING, BUT MY BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN.
I LOVE THEM AND I MISS THEM. &gt;&gt; DO YOU WANT TO GET OUT AND
RUN AROUND? WHERE IS ADOREE JACKSON?
WHERE'S JOURDAN LEWIS? DO YOU THINK -- CAN YOU BEAT
THOSE GUYS ON THIS TURF? &gt;&gt; MAN, YEAH.
&gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT GOING TO FIND OUT, STAY SAFE.
CONGRATULATIONS. DEDE WESTBROOK.
OKLAHOMA. SAM.
&gt;&gt; THANKS, CHRIS. NOW IT'S TIME TO LOOK AT
ALLSTATE'S AFCA GOOD WORKS TEAM. THIS YEAR'S CAPTAIN, BRETT

      <description>&gt;&gt; Referee: PENALTY ON THE
KICKING TEAM. FIRST DOWN.
&gt;&gt; Mark: ROD, LET'SMONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL."
&gt;&gt; Tom: NICK HOLT ALWAYS COACHING THEM UP.
HE'S AN INTENSE DIE. HE'S THE TYPE OF PERSONALITY YOU
WANT YOUR DEFENSE TO MIRROR. &gt;&gt; Dave: HE WAS DEMONSTRATING
WITH QUINT KESSENICH YESTERDAY HOW TO AVOID THE CUT BLOCKS ON
DEFENSE BY LOUISIANA TECH. OPEN RECEIVER.
PULLED IN AT THE 30 YARD LINE. PUSHED OUT INSIDE THE 10. &gt;&gt; Tom: AND HERE WE GO.
A GOOD THROW. NICE AND SMOOTH.
YOU SEE ON THE INSIDE RELEASE THERE FOR NUMBER 2, TAYWAN
TAYLOR. THAT'S A REALLY WELL-THROWN,
CATCHABLE BALL. THROWING TAYLOR OPEN.
EXPLOSIVE PLAYS APLENTY. BOTH TEAMS, DAVE, RANK IN THE
TOP FIVE NATIONALLY. NOT JUST IF CONFERENCE USA.
TOP FIVE NABLLY IN PLAYS OF 20 YARDS OR MORE.
THAT'S A NIGHTMARE DEFENSE. &gt;&gt; Dave: 55 YARDS ON THAT PLAY.
THEY'RE 1 AND 2 RESPECTIVELY IN YARDS PER PLAY NATIONALLY.
WALES PICKS UP ABOUT TWO. DOWN TO THE 6 YARD LINE.
&gt;&gt; Quint: AS YOU'RE WATCHING AT HOME.
ANYTIME WESTERN KENTUCKY GETS NEAR THE LOGO IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE FIELD, THAT'S WHEN THEY LIKE TO TAKE THEIR SHOTS.
&gt;&gt; Tom: MIKE WHITE HAS THROWN SOME DARTS.
&gt;&gt; Dave: MOVEMENT ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE LINE.
&gt;&gt; Referee: FALSE START. OFFENSE, NUMBER 79.
FIVE-YARD PENALTY. SECOND DOWN.
&gt;&gt; Tom: SPEAKING OF THE TOWEL LOGO, WHO HAS A TOWEL AS A LOGO?
IT'S AWESOME. YOU HAVE BIG RED THERE.
YOU GOT IT GOING ON. &gt;&gt; VERY UNUSUAL.
&gt;&gt; Tom: THERE'S BIG RED. &gt;&gt; Quint: WE'LL SPEND MORE TIME
WITH BIG RED LATER. &gt;&gt; Dave: FINAL PLAY OF THE FIRST
QUARTER. AND DUMPING IT OFF TO WALES.
THAT'S THREE ALREADY FOR ANTHONY WALES.
TWO ON THE GROUND, ONE THROUGH THE AIR.
&gt;&gt; Tom: BIG RED SURE LIKED IT. APPARENTLY, DAVE, ANTHONY WALES
IS ONLY ALLOWED TO SCORE WITHIN A SIX-INCH DIAMETER OF THE PIE
IN THE END ZONE. DCH HE'S GOT 24 TOTAL TOUCHDOWNS
ON THE SEASON. AND 40 POINTS SCORED IN A                âª           [SFX: Bong!] &gt;&gt; Referee: PENALTY ON THE
KICKING TEAM. FIRST DOWN.
&gt;&gt; Mark: ROD, LET'SHENDERSON, N TAYLOR.
AND THEN THEY HAVE SUPPLEMENTAL PLAYERS.
&gt;&gt; Dave: FIRES HIGH. IT'S CAUGHT.
DOWN NEAR THE 20 YARD LINE IS CONNER SMITH.
ONLY HIS EIGHTH CATCH OF THE SEASON.
BUT IT GIVES LOUISIANA TECH THE FIRST DOWN AND A GAIN OF 22.
&gt;&gt; Tom: CONNER SMITH, NUMBER 9, SECURES THE FOOTBALL.
KNOWS HE'S GOING TO TAKE A SHOT. JUST GOOD, SURE-HANDED PASS
CATCHERS FOR THE BULLDOGS CLUB. &gt;&gt; Dave: THE CATCH MADE BY
BONNETTE. HE STEPPED OUT.
AND LET'S SEE WHERE THEY MARK HIM.
HE'S SHORT OF THE LINE TO GAIN BY A COUPLE OF YARDS.
THERE ARE JUST SO MANY OPEN RECEIVERS.
WE HAVEN'T SEEN MANY THROWS INTO TIGHT WINDOWS.
THE RECEIVERS RUNNING FREE JUST ABOUT EVERY PLAY.
THEY FAKE THE PITCH. THE QUARTERBACK, HIGGINS, GETS
THE FIRST DOWN. FIRST AND GOAL.
LOOKING TO TIE THE GAME HERE. JOEL IYIEGBUNIWE WITH THE
TACKLE. &gt;&gt; Tom: THERE YOU GO.
MOST PRODUCTIVE RUN THAT LOUISIANA TECH HAS HAD SO FAR IS
WITH THE QUARTERBACK ON THE SPEED OPTION.
&gt;&gt; Dave: EMPTY FROM THE 10 ON FIRST AND GOAL.
HIGGINS, TO TAYLOR. AND HE'S DOWN NEAR THE 5 YARD
LINE. &gt;&gt; Quint: WHAT HIGGINS DOES WELL
WITH THE BUBBLES IS PUTS IT OUT IN FRONT OF THE RECEIVER AND
ALLOWS HIM TO CATCH IT IN STRIDE.
THEY WASTE NO TIME BETWEEN THE CATCH AND THE RUNNING MOTION.
RIGHT ON THE CHEST OF TRENT TAYLOR.
&gt;&gt; Dave: THE ALL-TIME LEADER AT LOUISIANA TECH IN RECEPTIONS AND
RECEIVING TOUCHDOWNS. HE'S GOT 307 CAREER CATCHES.
116 ON THE SEASON. SECOND AND GOAL.
FOUR MEN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN.
THEY THROW IT THAT WAY. GET BLOCKERS OUT THERE FOR
CRAFT. HE'S INTO THE END ZONE FOR A
TOUCHDOWN! SET UP BEAUTIFULLY AND EXECUTED
BEAUTIFULLY BY LOUISIANA TECH. &gt;&gt; Tom: WHAT A GREAT EFFORT BY
REPRESENT THE TAYLOR. NUMBER 5.
MAKES A BLOCK AND CHOPS DOWN THE WESTERN KENTUCKY DEFENDER.
RIGHT THERE. BALL RIGHT DOWN ON THE GROUND
THERE FOR NUMBER 5. AND LISTEN, HE'S NOT JUST
CATCHING FOOTBALL PS. THIS GUY IS MAKING THINGS HAPPEN
ON THE PERIMETER FOR OTHER TEAMMATES.
SO DIFFICULT TO DEFEND THE SHORT PASSING GAME.                âªâª                âªâª                âªâª                âªâª                âªâª</description>

WESTERN KENTUCKY, 25 PLAYS. THE HILLTOPPERS PITCH IT TO
TOWNER. TOWNER GETS TO THE 28 YARD LINE.
JUST ABOUT EVERY GAME WE DO UNFORTUNATELY THESE DAYS HAS
SOMEONE INVOLVED THAT HAS BEEN TOUCHED BY CANCER.
LA TECH RUNNING BACK JAQWIS DANCE SI HAS STAGE THREE
HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA. HE'S MEETING WITH A YOUNG MAN
GOING THROUGH THE SAME DISEASE. BOTH GOING THROUGH CANCER
TREATMENT AT ST. JUDE HOSPITAL IN MEMPHIS.
AND LOUISIANA TECH IS HONORING JAQWIS DANCY.
THEY SET UP THE SCREEN. AND LOOSE IS WALES.
AT THE 45 YARD LINE. AT THE 50.
AND OUT OF BOUNDS AT THE 45 YARD LINE.
WE HAVE SO MANY COLLEAGUES AT ESPN THAT HAVE BEEN BATTLING
CANCER THIS YEAR. OUR OWN HOLLY ROWE.
AND ROD GILMORE. QUINT, YOU WORK WITH ROD EVERY
WEEK. WHAT HAS IT BEEN LIKE THIS YEAR
TO WATCH HIM GO THROUGH SNIT HOW INSPIRATIONAL HAS HE BEEN WITH
YOU? &gt;&gt; Quint: HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH
MULTIPLE MY LOAM LA. HE WAS GOING TO THE HOSPITAL
THREE DAYS A WEEK FOR TREATMENT. NEVER HAD COMPLAINTS.
SHOWED ME THE TRUE MEANING OF THE WORD TOUGHNESS.
&gt;&gt; Dave: DEEP BALL, ON THE THE MONEY, ANOTHER TOUCHDOWN.
TAYWAN TAYLOR. CAN ANYBODY STOP ANYBODY?
HAVE SOME HOT TEA AND LEMONS. &gt;&gt; Tom: IS THAT A RHETORICAL
QUESTION? NUMBER 2, TAYWAN TAYLOR THERE.
TURNS ON THE SPEED CUT. THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT A GAME
OF INCHES. SAFETY COMES OVER LATE.
OVER THE TOP. LOUISIANA TECH JUST NOT ABLE TO
GET THERE. TAYLOR AFTER AN EARLY FIRST
QUARTER DROP HAS RESPONDED AND SO HAS MIKE WHITE AFTER THROWING
A PICK SIX IN THE FIRST QUARTER ADDS WELL.
&gt;&gt; Dave: THERE'S TEN MINUTES REMAINING IN THE FIRST HALF.
AND THEY HAVE SCORED 55 POINTS. WESTERN KENTUCKY COMES RIGHT
BACK. THE TOUCHDOWN PASS.
TO RETAKE THE LEAD. DON'T GO AWAY.
BECAUSE LOUISIANA TECH IS GOING TO GET THE BALL BACK.
AND PROBABLY SCORE IN THE NEXT          REMEMBER 2007?           SMARTPHONES?              O M G    TEN YEARS LATER,

&gt;&gt; Mark: ROD, LET'S &gt;&gt;&gt; TONIGHT ON ABC, THE DR.
PERSON ACC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME. DOES VIRGINIA TECH HAVE A SHOT
WITH CLEMSON? &gt;&gt; Tom: I THINK ANYTIME YOU HAVE
A QUARTERBACK YOU HAVE TO DEFEND WITH YOUR FEET, YOU DO.
THEY'RE REALLY TALENTED WHEN THEY DON'T TURN THE BALL OVER.
&gt;&gt; Dave: PART OF DR. PERSON CHAMPIONSHIP WEEK.
LOUISIANA TECH WITH A SECOND AND 6 ON THE 19 YARD LINE.
KNOCKED DOWN. RULED A FORWARD PASS.
BROWN TIPPED IT. WE HAVE SEEN CLEMSON TWICE.
THEY BEAT SYRACUSE 54-0. THAT WAS NOTHING COMPARED TO
WHAT PITT DID TO THEM. THOUGH SYRACUSE DID SCORE 61.
THEY GAVE UP 76. THE MOST POINTS SCORED IN SANGLE
GAME. THEY SCORED IN THAT GAME, 56
POINTS IN THE FIRST HALF. THESE TWO TEAMS HAVE 55 IN THE
FIRST HALF. WE HAVE A WAYS TO GO TO GET TO
THE CLEMSON-SYRACUSE TERRITORY. OR PITT-SYRACUSE, I SHOULD SAY.
THAT PASS JUGGLED BY TAYLOR. HE DID NOT COME UP WITH IT.
INCOMPLETE. FOURTH AND SIX.
AND FINALLY, SOMEONE IS STOPPED. &gt;&gt; Tom: MAKE A NOTE OF THAT.
THAT ARE WILL BE ONE OF THE FEW DROPS OR INABILITY TO HAUL THE
BALL IN THAT YOU'LL SEE FROM NUMBER 5.
FINALLY A STOP ON DEFENSE FOR WESTERN KENTUCKY.
A RED ZONE STOP WHICH WE HAVE NOT SEEN SINCE THE FIRST TWO
SERIES OF THE FIRST QUARTER. &gt;&gt; Dave: HE MADE THE CATCH BUT
LOST CONTROL OUT OF BOUNDS. JONATHAN BARNES.
A 25-YARD ATTEMPT EARLIER. SO IT'S 31-27.
MIDWAY THROUGH THE SECOND QUARTER.                âªâª
QUARTER.                âªâª                âªâª                âªâª                âªâª               (VO)
        Be good at life. &gt;&gt; Referee: PENALTY ON THE
KICKING TEAM. FIRST DOWN.
&gt;&gt; Mark: ROD, LET'S &gt;&gt; Dave: FIRST AND TEN ON THE 13
YARD LINE. BACK TO WALES.
TRYING TO GET OUTSIDE. AND, HE'S OUT OF BOUNDS INSIDE
THE 10. TRIPPED UP BY DEMARION KING.
&gt;&gt; Tom: BOTH TEAMS HAVE BEEN, AT WILL, ABLE TO DO WHAT THEY WANT
AND WHEN THEY WANT. THE DIFFERENCE HAS BEEN WESTERN
KENTUCKY'S ABILITY TO RUN THE FOOTBALL ON ANY GIVEN DOWN AND
BE VERY PRODUCTIVE. WINNING THE BATTLE IN THE
TRENCHES. WE TALKED ABOUT FORREST LAMP.
THE LEFT TACKLE. AN NL PROSPECT AS A GUARD.
HE'S BEEN VERY SHARP TODAY. GREAT BALANCE FOR THE
HILLTOPPERS. &gt;&gt; Dave: WALES. GRABBED AT THE ANKLES.
FERGUSON. FIRST TIME WE HAVE CALLED HIS
NAME. HE'S A TERRIFIC PASS RUSHER.
14 1/2 SACKS. BUT WITH WESTERN KENTUCKY
SNAPPING IT AND MIKE WHITE GETTING IT OUT OF HIS HANDS SO
QUICKLY. FERGUSON DOESN'T EVEN HAVE A
CHANCE. IT'S LIKE WHAT HE DOES HAS BEEN
NEGATED IN THE GAME. &gt;&gt; Tom: IN THE RUN GAME, YOU RUN
RIGHT AT HIM. &gt;&gt; Dave: BIG THIRD DOWN.
A SHOVEL PASS. WALES.
CLOSE TO THE FIRST DOWN. AT THE 3 YARD LINE.
BRANDON DURMAN IN FOR SANTOS MADE THE HIT.
HE APPEARS TO BE SHORT. FOURTH DOWN.
AND WESTERN KENTUCKY -- NOPE, THEY'RE GOING TO SAY IT'S A
FIRST DOWN NOW. A FRESH SET OF DOWNS INSIDE THE
3 YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; Tom: AND WITHOUT A
MEASUREMENT. &gt;&gt; Quint: WESTERN KENTUCKY GOING
BIG PERSONNEL NOW. TWO TIGHT ENDS AND A FULLBACK.
&gt;&gt; Tom: I WOULD HAVE BEEN IN FAVOR OF HIM GOING FOR IT.
YOU HAVE A FIELD POSITION ADVANTAGE AS WELL AS POINTS.
LINE UP YOUR BIG BOYS HERE. &gt;&gt; Dave: GOOD JOB THERE UP FRONT
BY LOUISIANA TECH. AS THEY TAKE DOWN WALES FOR A
LOSS. KING AND DURMAN IN THERE.
FOR LOUISIANA TECH. NEARING FIVE MINUTES TO GO.
THIS HAS BEEN THE LONGEST DRIVE OF THE GAME.
AND THEY STARTED ON THE 22 YARD LINE BECAUSE OF THE GREAT
KICKOFF RETURN. &gt;&gt; Tom: METHODICAL.
VERY DISCIPLINED SERIES FROM JEFF BROHM.
&gt;&gt; Dave: A FADE TO THE END ZONE. ON THE MONEY.
TAYWAN TAYLOR WITH ANOTHER ONE. &gt;&gt; Tom: LINE UP YOUR BEST PLAYER
ON THE PERIMETER. GREAT QUICKNESS AND MOVE OFF THE
LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. IT CREATES THE SEPARATION IN AN
AREA FOR MIKE WHITE TO DELIVER THIS FOOTBALL.
IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN THROWN BETTER.
SECURE IF THE BALL, GET THE TOUCHDOWN.
MORE POINTS. &gt;&gt; Dave: THREE TOUCHDOWN PASSES
FOR WHITE. TWO ON THE DAY FOR TAYLOR.                âªâª                âªâª                âªâª                âªâª              (both)
              Yes!        THERE ARE THOSE WHO
          LOVE SRIRACHA. AND THOSE WHO HAVEN'T TRIED IT.      AND FOR A LIMITED TIME   WENDY'S BACON SRIRACHA FRIES  ARE THE PERFECT INTRODUCTION.      SRIRACHA INFUSED AIOLI    AND APPLEWOOD-SMOKED BACON          ALL FOR $1.99.      AND AT WENDY'S THERE'S
     MORE SRIRACHA TO COME. &gt;&gt; Referee: PENALTY ON THE
KICKING TEAM. FIRST DOWN.
&gt;&gt; Mark: ROD, LET'SLLY, EVERY TE RUNNING A FIRST DOWN PLAY,
THEY'RE GETTING ANOTHER FIRST DOWN.
PLAY FAKE. LONG THROW.
CATCH IS MADE. AND ANOTHER FIRST DOWN.
CARLOS HENDERSON. BROUGHT DOWN BY JOE BROWN.
&gt;&gt; Tom: AND YET ANOTHER 11 YARDS.
&gt;&gt; Dave: HENDERSON OVER 150</description>

      <description>         REMEMBER 2007?           SMARTPHONES?              O M G    TEN YEARS LATER,
   NOTHING'S REALLY CHANGED.   IT'S TIME TO SNAP OUT OF IT.           HELLO MOTO.      SNAP ON A JBL SPEAKER.   PUT A 70" SCREEN ON A WALL.     GET A 10X OPTICAL ZOOM.        GET EXCITED WORLD.           HELLO MOTO.          MOTO IS HERE.  THE NEW MOTO Z WITH MOTOMODS.     SAVE UP TO $400 WHEN YOU
    TRADE IN YOUR OLD PHONE      AND SWITCH TO VERIZON. &gt;&gt; Referee: PENALTY ON THE
KICKING TEAM. FIRST DOWN.
&gt;&gt; Mark: ROD, LET'S &gt;&gt;&gt; TONIGHT ON ABC, THE DR.
PERSON ACC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME. DOES VIRGINIA TECH HAVE A SHOT
WITH CLEMSON? &gt;&gt; Tom: I THINK ANYTIME YOU HAVE
A QUARTERBACK YOU HAVE TO DEFEND WITH YOUR FEET, YOU DO.
THEY'RE REALLY TALENTED WHEN THEY DON'T TURN THE BALL OVER.
&gt;&gt; Dave: PART OF DR. PERSON CHAMPIONSHIP WEEK.
LOUISIANA TECH WITH A SECOND AND 6 ON THE 19 YARD LINE.
KNOCKED DOWN. RULED A FORWARD PASS.
BROWN TIPPED IT. WE HAVE SEEN CLEMSON TWICE.
THEY BEAT SYRACUSE 54-0. THAT WAS NOTHING COMPARED TO
WHAT PITT DID TO THEM. THOUGH SYRACUSE DID SCORE 61.
THEY GAVE UP 76. THE MOST POINTS SCORED IN SANGLE
GAME. THEY SCORED IN THAT GAME, 56
POINTS IN THE FIRST HALF. THESE TWO TEAMS HAVE 55 IN THE
FIRST HALF. WE HAVE A WAYS TO GO TO GET TO
THE CLEMSON-SYRACUSE TERRITORY. OR PITT-SYRACUSE, I SHOULD SAY.
THAT PASS JUGGLED BY TAYLOR. HE DID NOT COME UP WITH IT.
INCOMPLETE. FOURTH AND SIX.
AND FINALLY, SOMEONE IS STOPPED. &gt;&gt; Tom: MAKE A NOTE OF THAT.
THAT ARE WILL BE ONE OF THE FEW DROPS OR INABILITY TO HAUL THE
BALL IN THAT YOU'LL SEE FROM NUMBER 5.
FINALLY A STOP ON DEFENSE FOR WESTERN KENTUCKY.
A RED ZONE STOP WHICH WE HAVE NOT SEEN SINCE THE FIRST TWO
SERIES OF THE FIRST QUARTER. &gt;&gt; Dave: HE MADE THE CATCH BUT
LOST CONTROL OUT OF BOUNDS. JONATHAN BARNES.
A 25-YARD ATTEMPT EARLIER. SO IT'S 31-27.
MIDWAY THROUGH THE SECOND QUARTER.                âªâª

      <description>MICHIGAN STATE HOPING TO PLAY
SPOILER. THIS COULD GIVE THE SPARTANS A
HALFTIME LEAD. SHORT RAPING FOR MICHAEL GEIGER.
HE IS FOUR FOR FOUR HERE IN THE FIRST HALF.
BARRING A LONG RUNBACK BY PENN STATE ON THE KICKOFF, THE
SPARTANS WHO HAVE HAD A LEAD IN EVERY SINGLE GAME THIS SEASON
AND YET HAVE ONLY MANAGED A âª âª                âª                âª             You too.            It's cool &gt;&gt; Referee: PENALTY ON THE

&gt;&gt; Mark: ROD, LET'S MONDAY NIGHT COUNTDOWN AT 1K6.
ALSO STREAMING LIVE ON WATCH ESPN.
&gt;&gt; Brock: BEEN A WHILE SINCE PENN STATE HAS BEEN ON OFFENSE.
IN LARGE PART BECAUSE OF MICHIGAN STATE'S ABILITY TO
CONTROL THAT FIRST OUT. &gt;&gt; Bob: CLOSE TO AN HOUR SINCE
PENN STATE RAN A MEANINGFUL OFFENSIVE PLAY.
THEY WILL GO TO BARKLEY HERE. AND THAT THEIR BEST
FIELD POSITION TAKING ADVANTAGE. A DROIV FOR FOUR OVER RODNEY.

JUST LIKE THAT, PENN STATE IN POSITIVE TEAR I DON'T REMEMBER.
&gt;&gt;&gt; FRANKLIN SURROUNDED HIMSELF WITH AN EXCELLENT STAFF.
THEIR ADJUSTMENTS GOING INTO AND COMING OUT OF HALFTIME AS BIG A
DEAL IN THEIR SUCCESS IN THE SECOND HALF AS ANYTHING.
&gt;&gt; Bob: McSORLEY A KEEPER. THREE MORE.
CHRIS FRIES TRIPPED HIM UP. &gt;&gt; Brock: YOU COULD SEE THE
SHOULDERS SQUARED TO THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE.
YOU COULD SEE THE EYES IN THE BACKFIELD.
NEVER ALLOWING A LANE FOR BARKLEY.
THEN WHEN THEY TAKE BARKLEY AWAY ON THE PERIMETER.
THE LINEBACKER THERE TO FINISH THING INST INSIDE TACKLE.
COULDN'T DO THAT BETTER THIS THE FIRST HALF AS FAR AS THE INSIDE
GOES. THAT WAS THE PRIORITY, MAKE
SOMEBODY OTHER THAN BARKLEY BEAT YOU.
&gt;&gt; Bob: FIVE-MAN RUSH. PICK AND CATCH.
McSORLEY EASILY IN THE RED ZONE. &gt;&gt; Brock: THIRD OPPORTUNITY.
PITCHING CATCH. COULDN'T HAVE BEEN EASIER ON
THIRD DOWN. MICHIGAN STATE ADJUSTING THE
LANE, FRESHMEN TO KEEP EVERYTHING IN FRONT OF THEM.
&gt;&gt; Bob: TWO BY TWO THIS TIME AS GESICKI GOES INTO MOTION.
THREE YARDS. A FIGHT UP FRONT FOR THAT CRUNCH
SEVEN FOR MICHIGAN STATE WITHOUT McDOWEL.
FIRST TIME PRESEASON ALLAMERICAN.
PROJECTED TO BE A TOP FIVE PICK BEFORE THE SEASON STARTED IN THE
NFL DRAFT. ANKLE INJURY.
HE HAS BEEN OUT THE LAST TWO GAMES AND DIDN'T EVEN MAKE THE
TRIP. THIS IS A YOUNGER GROUP THAT
MARK DANTONIO HAS GONE TO UP FRONT.
McSORLEY OFF PLAY ACTION. PUMPS ONCE.
HE'S LOOKING END ZONE. PENN STATE TOUCHDOWN.
PENN STATE TAKES THE FIELD POSITION TO TURN IT INTO SEVEN.
THEY HAVE GOT THE LEAD BACK. &gt;&gt; Brock: ADJUSTMENTS AFTER
HALFTIME. DOUBLE MOVE ON SAFETY.
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPONENT.
BRILLIANT Xs AND Os EXECUTION.                âªâª                âªâª  I'LL HAVE THAT GOAT
 CHEESE GARDEN SALAD. THAT GENTLEMAN GOT THE LAST ONE.  SIR, YOU GIVE ME THAT SALAD

       PICK YOUR MOVIE.      CAN I PICK THE GENRE? YES, BUT IT HAS TO BE A COMEDY. A LITTLE CASH BACK ON THE SIDE.   WITH THE BLUE CASH EVERYDAY
  CARD FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS,  YOU GET CASH BACK ON PURCHASES
 WITH NO ANNUAL FEE.              THROW.    IT'S MORE THAN CASH BACK.  IT'S BACKED BY THE SERVICE AND

BECAUSE THE ENERGY HERE IN THE STADIUM IS PALPABLE HERE IN THE
SECOND HALF. &gt;&gt; Bob: BLITZ.
SCOTT. MET BY SPINDLE.
WE EXPECTED SCOTT COLLISIONS TODAY.
WE GOT ONE THERE. &gt;&gt; Brock: 230 POUND BATTERING
RAM. L.J. KNOCKED OTT EARLY IN THE
GAME AND SO WAS CABINDA. THEY KNOW WHAT'S AT STAKE.
CABINDA AND THE PENN STATE TEAM HAVE SUCH A DOMINANT SECOND HALF
GAME. &gt;&gt; Bob: AGAIN SCOTT.
SHOVELS BACK.  CABINDA IN THE MIDDLE OF LYLES.
BROWN ALL OVER PRICE. NOW IT'S THIRD DOWN AND LONG ODD
MAN RUSH. LONG THROW.
R.J. LOST HIS FOOTING COMING OUT OF THE FRAY.
I'M NOT SURE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PICK UP THE FIRST DOWN
ANYWAY. BUT O'CONNOR THREW IT RIGHT OVER
HIS HEAD. &gt;&gt; Brock: THIRD DOWNS WERE
SIMPLER THAN THIRD AND 9 AND THIRD AND 11. &gt;&gt; Bob: A BETTER            [beeping]

&gt;&gt; Mark: ROD, LET'SWHERE WILL T? WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO MICHIGAN?
SAQUON BARKLEY. ROBINSON, ROBINSON FOUND THE
HOLE AND GOT TO THE 43 YARD LINE.
&gt;&gt; Brock: MICHIGAN STATE IN THE DEFENSIVE ZONE FIELDS TOO MUCH.
HITTING A COUPLE OF THOSE SEAMS. BARRETT AND CREW.
EYES ARE IN THE BACK FIELD LOOKING AT ZONE READ, LOOKING AT
SOME OF THE EDGE RUN. RIGHT UP THE GUT.
ONE OF THE RARE CREASES. FOCAL POINT AT HALFTIME TO GET
THAT RUN GAME CORRECTED. GOOD EXECUTION FROM THE NITTANY
LIONS. &gt;&gt; Bob: DARKLY CAUGHT BEHIND THE
LINE THIS TIME. AND DOES WELL TO DODGE ROBERT
BOWERS AND SIMPLY GET TO THE SIDELINE AND LOSE ONLY A LAW.
THERE IS THE ANYTHING TESTIFY PLAY ON FIRST DOWN THAT MICHIGAN
STATE NEEDED TO CREATE AS CRIES FRIES HELD THE EDGE AS WELL.
&gt;&gt; Brock: I'M GOING TO BE CURIOUS OVER THE NEXT 22
MINUTES, THE SECONDARY, THE CORNERS, DANTONIO HAS BEEN
ASKING THEM TO KEEP EVERYTHING IN FRONT.
THERE HAS BEEN CUSHION IN THESE OBVIOUS PASSING SITUATIONS.
THEY GET BURNED ON THE MOVE, INIT'S TIME TO CLOSE DOWN THESE
POSITIONS AND YOU CAN SEE IT ON THE PERIMETER.
&gt;&gt; Bob: FOUR-MAN RUSH ON SECOND DOWN AND 12.
McSORLEY GETS OUT OF THE POCKET. HE IS GOING TOWARDS THE END
ZONE. UNDER THROWS.
TOUCHDOWN! &gt;&gt; Brock: McSORLEY -- HIS
TEAMMATES LOVE HIM, FOR SITUATIONS LIKE THAT.
&gt;&gt; GARE ONHICKS BY THE WAY INJURED ON THAT PLAY.
HE IS NOW WALKING OFF THE FIELD VERY SLOWLY AS HE TRIED TO FIGHT
FOR THE FOOTBALL. BUT THAT 6'6"252 POUNDS LIKE A
POWER FORWARD GOING UP FOR A REBOUND.
&gt;&gt; Brock: GOOD RECEIVER SAYS THE SAME THING TO THE PASSER, JUST
GIVE ME A CHANCE. THIS ALL THINK THEY CAN MAKE
EVERY CATCH IN THE BOOK. THERE ARE TIMES THE QUARTERBACK
HAS TO MAKE THAT DECISION. PERFECT EXAMPLE THERE.
ALLOW A GUY TO GO UP AND CRUSH IT.
A PHYSICALLY SKILL KID WHO HAS BEEN A PERFECT FIT IN THE SYSTEM
AS WELL GROWING EACH AND EVERY WEEK.
PART OF THE SEVEN GAME WINNING STREAK.
THAT GUY IS A WINNER. YOU SEE IT.
IT EMANATES FROM HIM, AND OOZES FROM HIM AND EVERYBODY AROUND
HIM IN THE CULTURE AND IN THE FOOTBALL CULTURE.
&gt;&gt; Bob: McSORLEY IN THE TOP FIVE IN AMERICA IN DEEP BALL THROWS.
THROWS A TOUCHDOWN TO GESICKI THERE. &gt;&gt; Referee: PENALTY ON THE
KICKING TEAM. FIRST DOWN.
&gt;&gt; Mark: ROD, LET'S WITH SCOTT. OPPORTUNITY.
&gt;&gt; Bob: QUARTERBACK FAKE. THAT LOOKS TO BE PLENTY GOOD
ENOUGH FOR A FIRST DOWN AS TIE LEER O'CONNOR PICKS UP THREE.
&gt;&gt; Brock: LOTS OF NEW GUYS IN THERE, INEXPERIENCED UP FRONT.
YOU GET THAT FIRST DOWN TO GIVE YOURSELF ANOTHER FOUR SNAPS.
&gt;&gt; Bob: WILLIAMS IN THE FIELD. LOOSE BALL IN THE EXCHANGE.
IT'S TYLER O'CONNOR WHOSE GOT IT.
THEY HAVE GOT PLAYERS BOTH POINTING IN THEIR RESPECTIVE
DIRECTIONS. BUT ONLY THE GUYS IN THE STRIPE
SHIRTS MATTER. WHICH WAY WILL THEY POINT?
PENN STATE. I THINK THE HEAD COACH CAN TAKE
THIS. A LOT OF TIME LEFT.
BUT IT IS A TAKEAWAY. THE FIRST TURNOVER OF THE GAME.
&gt;&gt; Brock: ANY TIME THAT OCCURS YOU TRY THE GET OUT OF THEIR WAY
AS A QUARTERBACK. BUT YOU HAVE TO -- I MEAN YOU
HAVE TO SECURE THAT SNAP. AND JAMES FRANKLIN TOLD US TWO
THINGS. THEY WANT TO ACCOMPLISH WINNING
THE TURNOVER BAETTLE BATTLE. TAKE THAT BALL AWAY.
NUMBER TWO, PLAY HARD. AS HARD AS THEY CAN PLAY.
SIX SECONDS AT A TIME. THEY ARE WINNING BOTH OF THOSE
COLUMNS RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; Bob: BARKLEY.
GAIN OF ABOUT TWO AND A HALF. REILLY AND MIKE ON THE TACKLE.
SLOW TO GET UP AND NOT ABLE TO PUT ANY WEIGHT ON THAT RIGHT
LEG. SAQUON BARKLEY.
MARK ALLEN IS ALREADY IN THE MUDDLE.
AND M âª âª BAMMA UP RIGHT NOW.
&gt;&gt; Bob: ALABAMA HAS A TWO SCORE LEAD.
PENN STATE HAS A TWO SCORE LEAD. BUT THEIR BEST PLAYER IS ON THE
BENCH RIGHT NOW. LOOKS LIKE IT IS A KNEE INJURY.
SAQUON BARKLEY. THE HEAD COACHES OVER THERE ARE
CONCERNED. MARK ALLEN TAKES OVER AT
TAILBACK TO THE RIGHT OF McSORLEY.
PLAY ACTION. ANOTHER DEEP BALL.
OUT IN FRONT. TOUCHDOWN!
PENN STATE IS ON A SEVEN-GAME WIN STREAK.
THEY HAVE AVERAGED OVER 39 POINTS PER GAME.
AND THEY HAVE GOT 31 ON THE BOARD STILL WITH TWO MINUTES TO
GO IN THE THIRD QUARTER. &gt;&gt; Brock: YOU PUT A GAME PLAN
TOGETHER AND YOU SEE IT EXECUTED.
THESE GUYS ARE GOING TO BE IN A BIND AT SOME POINT IN THIS GAME.
JOE MOORHEAD THE OFFENSIVE COORDINAOR IS TOO GOOD.
LOOK AT THE FIELD. YOU ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE AGAINST
A RED SHIRT FRESHMAN. PENN STATE HAS COME TO LIFE FOR
A REASON AT THE END OF THE YEAR. McSORLEY HAS BEEN DOING THIS ALL
SEASON LONG. HE HAS BEEN ONE OF THE FIVE BEST
IN ALL OF COLLEGE FOOTBALL. GOD AT IT.
IT SHOWS UP ON THE STAT SHEET. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF
INEXPERIENCED PLAYERS IN BIG MOMENTS.
THAT'S WHY THAT COACH LOVES IT. &gt;&gt; Bob: R.J. SHELTON FROM THE
GOAL LINE. DOESN'T EVEN MAKE IT TO THE 20.
McSORLEY CE INTO TODAY SECOND BEST IN FBS WITH 16 COMPLETIONS
OF 40 OR MORE YARDS. HE HAS TWO MORE TODAY THAT LAST
ONE FOR THE TOUCHDOWN THE. BUT THERE IS THIS IDEA THE ZONE
READ WITH McSORLEY AND BARKLEY. AND CERTAINLY THAT HAS BEEN WHAT
HAS POWERED THIS OFFENSE.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt; Referee: PENALTY ON THE
KIING TEAM. FIRST DOWN.
&gt;&gt; Mark: ROD, LET'SWHERE WILL T? WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO MICHIGAN?
SAQUON BARKLEY. ROBINSON, ROBINSON FOUND THE
HOLE AND GOT TO THE 43 YARD LINE.
&gt;&gt; Brock: MICHIGAN STATE IN THE DEFENSIVE ZONE FIELDS TOO MUCH.
HITTING A COUPLE OF THOSE SEAMS. BARRETT AND CREW.
EYES ARE IN THE BACK FIELD LOOKING AT ZONE READ, LOOKING AT
SOME OF THE EDGE RUN. RIGHT UP THE GUT.
ONE OF THE RARE CREASES. FOCAL POINT AT HALFTIME TO GET
THAT RUN GAME CORRECTED. GOOD EXECUTION FROM THE NITTANY
LIONS. &gt;&gt; Bob: DARKLY CAUGHT BEHIND THE
LINE THIS TIME. AND DOES WELL TO DODGE ROBERT
BOWERS AND SIMPLY GET TO THE SIDELINE AND LOSE ONLY A LAW.
THERE IS THE ANYTHING TESTIFY PLAY ON FIRST DOWN THAT MICHIGAN
STATE NEEDED TO CREATE AS CRIES FRIES HELD THE EDGE AS WELL.
&gt;&gt; Brock: I'M GOING TO BE CURIOUS OVER THE NEXT 22
MINUTES, THE SECONDARY, THE CORNERS, DANTONIO HAS BEEN
ASKING THEM TO KEEP EVERYTHING IN FRONT.
THERE HAS BEEN CUSHION IN THESE OBVIOUS PASSING SITUATIONS.
THEY GET BURNED ON THE MOVE, INIT'S TIME TO CLOSE DOWN THESE
POSITIONS AND YOU CAN SEE IT ON THE PERIMETER.
&gt;&gt; Bob: FOUR-MAN RUSH ON SECOND DOWN AND 12.
McSORLEY GETS OUT OF THE POCKET. HE IS GOING TOWARDS THE END
ZONE. UNDER THROWS.
TOUCHDOWN! &gt;&gt; Brock: McSORLEY -- HIS
TEAMMATES LOVE HIM, FOR SITUATIONS LIKE THAT.
&gt;&gt; GARE ONHICKS BY THE WAY INJURED ON THAT PLAY.
HE IS NOW WALKING OFF THE FIELD VERY SLOWLY AS HE TRIED TO FIGHT
FOR THE FOOTBALL. BUT THAT 6'6"252 POUNDS LIKE A
POWER FORWARD GOING UP FOR A REBOUND.

      <description>KEEP AN EYE ON FULLER ON THE
SQUARE IN. I THINK THAT'S WHERE BILL
O'BRIEN WANTS THIS BALL TO GO. HE'S WIDE OPEN, THERE'S NO ONE
THERE. HERE'S THE PREGAME GRINDER,
MALCOLM SMITH, THE EX-SUPER BOWL MVP OF THE SEATTLE SEAHAWKS.
AND OSWEILER CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE WITH TURNOVERS.
BE CAREFUL OUT OF THE SUDDEN CHANGE.
COOPER AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN HAS BEEN AWFULLY QUIET
WORKING AGAINST A.J. BOUYE. &gt;&gt; Sean: FROM MIDFIELD, 1:30 TO
GO. CARR, ANOTHER DROP, THIS ONE BY
SETH ROBERTS, HIS SECOND WITHIN A MATTER OF MOMENTS.
&gt;&gt; Jon: ROBERTS HAS BEEN A VERY CLUTCH SLOT RECEIVER AND DEREK
CARR DISAPPOINTED OBVIOUSLY ON SECOND DOWN.
WILL ROMEO CRENNEL BRING SOME HEAT?
CLOWNEY AT TOP OF THE SCREEN HAS GIVEN AUSTIN HOWARD FITS.
&gt;&gt; Sean: OAKLAND POSSESSION, SET UP BY THE FOURTH CAREER
INTERCEPTION BY MALCOLM SMITH. A HUGE ONE WHILE A SEAHAWK IN
THE SUPER BOWL, WIN OVER DENVER. ACROSS THE MIDDLE.
LATAVIUS MURRAY, ANKLE TACKLED SHORT OF FIRST DOWN.
&gt;&gt; Jon: GOOD TACK LING SECONDARY AND I LIKE WATCHING ROMEO'S
DEFENSES AS THEY SPIN THE DIAL IN THE TWO-MINUTE DRILL.
THEY NEVER PLAY THE SAME COVERAGE BACK-TO-BACK PLAYS AND
THEY DISGUISE THEM WELL. &gt;&gt; Sean: INSIDE HANDOFF, MURRAY
COULDN'T FIND ANY RUNNING ROOM. HE GETS THROWN DOWN.
JADEVEON CLOWNEY AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PILE, WITH HELP UP TOP BY
ANDRE HAL. THE CLOCK RUNS TO 50 SECONDS
LEFT IN HALF. &gt;&gt; Jon: THE HOUSTON TEXANS HAVE
DONE IT ON GOAL LINE. THEY HAVE REJECTED THIS RUNNING
GAME. PENETRATION. SHEDDING BLOCKS.
&gt;&gt; Sean: THEY NIGHT TRY A FIELD GOAL, 58 YARDS BUT HERE AT
ALTITUDE, JANIKWSKI, MORE 50-YARD FIELD GOALS THAN ANY
OTHER PLAYER IN LEAGUE HISTORY, 55 OF THEM.
THEY'RE GOING FOR IT ON FOURTH AND ONE.
AND THE RECEIVER, CRABTREE WITH THE BALL EN ROUTE.
JOHNATHAN JOSEPH HAD THE COVERAGE AND OAKLAND TURNS IT
OVER DOWNS. &gt;&gt; Jon: THAT'S STRENGTH OF THIS
TEXANS DEFENSE, THESE CORNERS CAN LOCK YOU DOWN. KAREEM JACKSON.
&gt;&gt; Sean: WE'LL SEE HOW BILL O'BRIEN ELECTS TO THROW IT.
ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST HALF UPCOMING.
CHRIS BERMAN WILL HIS FINAL DRIVE.
THE SUBJECT, DAK PRESCOTT AND TOM BRADY AND THE LATEST NEWS
AND NOTES FROM AROUND THE NFL FROM THE GREAT ADAM SCHEFTER.
THREE RECEIVERS TO THE LEFT. WILL THEY TRY TO THROW A DEEP
BALL? OSWEILER THROWS IT SHORT.
MINIMAL GAIN TO BRAXTON MILLER, JACK DEL RIO SAYING IT SHOULD BE
INCOMPLETE. THE BALL CAME OUT AT THE END OF
THE PLAY. REALLY DOESN'T MATTER.
THEY GAINED ONE YARD. &gt;&gt; Jon: WITH NINE SECONDS LEFT,
THE ONLY THING THAT THE TEXANS CAN DO OBVIOUSLY IS COMPLETE
TIME-OUT, LONG-RANGE FIELD GOAL AND MEANINGLESS CATCH AND THAT
WASTED A LOT OF TIME. OSWEILER, DEEP ARM.
OFF THE HANDS OF WILL FULLER THE SPEEDY ROOKIE.
OUT OF NOTRE DAME. RAN THE FASTEST TIME AT THE
COMBINE. EARLIER THIS YEAR.
4.28 IN HIS PRO DAY AT NOTRE DAME.
4.32 IN INDIANAPOLIS. &gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT NOW HE'S ONE-TRICK
PONY. HE CAN RUN DEEP ROUTES.
CREDIT AMERSON WITH THE COVER DOWN THE FIELD.
HE AND SMITH, TALL, RANGY, MAN TO MAN DEFENDERS AND HERE COMES
A HAIL MARY. PREVENT DEFENSE BY THE RAIDERS.
SIX OAKLAND RAIDERS DEEP IN COVERAGE.
&gt;&gt; Sean: PLAY CLOCK RUNNING OUT. OSWEILER UNDER DURESS AND SACKED
BY KHALIL MACK. THEY RENEW THEIR ACQUAINTANCE ON
THE FINAL PLAY OF THE FIRST HALF.
&gt;&gt; Jon: CAN'T BLOCK HIM ONE-ON-ONE.
NOT MANY PEOPLE CAN. SPEED RUSH, NO CHANCE.
END OF THE HALF. &gt;&gt; Sean: RAN RIGHT AROUND CHRIS
CLARK. AT THE HALF, 10-10 THE SCORE.
STAY TUNED FOR THE TOYOTA HALFTIME WITH CHRIS BERMAN RIGHT
AFTER THIS SHORT TIME-OUT.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; WELCOME, EVERYBODY, TO
TOYOTA HALFTIME SHOW. GLAD YOU COULD BE WITH US AT
ESTADIO AZTECA, HISTORIC NIGHT, MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL OUT OF THE
UNITED STATES, HERE IN MEXICO, LOT OF FUN.
CHRIS BERMAN ALONG WITH STEVE YOUNG, TRENT DILFER AND CHARLES
WOODSON. 10-10 FIRST HALF.
A LITTLE FIESTA GOING ON IN MEXICO CITY.
LONG HALFTIME SHOW. LET ME START WITH THE GUY WHO
HAS THE MOST VESTED INTEREST IN THIS HALF.
I THOUGHT THAT HOUSTON, CHARLES, CAME OUT, AN OAKLAND HOME GAME
HOUSTON CAME OUT AUTHORITATIVELY, DO YOU AGREE.
&gt;&gt; YES. I LIKED THE OAKLAND RAIDERS
TONIGHT STARTING OUT, ALLOWING THE TEXANS TO DRIVE DOWN THE
FIELD AND GET INTO FIELD GOAL RANGE AND ALLOWED THEM TO GET
THREE POINT. THE GOOD THING ABOUT IT IS, THEY
HOLD THEM TO THREE POINTS. THEIR SPECIAL TEAMS COMES ONE A
BIG INSIDE THE 20 YARD LINE. WE GOT A CHANCE TO GO UP 14-7 AT
THAT POINT AND YOU ONLY GET THREE POINTS OUT OF THAT.
WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO ASSERT YOUR DOMINANCE THE LEAGUE AND
GET TO THE POSTSEASON, THESE TYPE OF GAMES YOU HAVE TO TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF THIS AND COME OUT AND BE DOMINANT.
&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO DO IT UP FRONT. THIS OFFENSIVE LINE WE'VE BEEN STUDYING THEY DOMINATED THE BALL
AND THEY COME OUT AND THEY CAN'T MOVE ANYBODY.
&gt;&gt; JADEVEON IS HAVING HIS WAY. &gt;&gt; EIGHT OFFENSIVE LINEMEN IN
THE GAME TO MOVE PEOPLE, THEY'RE LOSING YARDS.
&gt;&gt; I THINK THAT'S THE NEWS IN THE FIRST HALF THE TEXANS BETTER
DEFENSIVELY THAN I THOUGHT AND OFFENSIVELY FINALLY SOME
EXPANSION. IT WAS LIKE OSWEILER COULDN'T
GET BEYOND THE 10 YARD LINE MARK.
THE TOUCHDOWN. &gt;&gt; GREAT ROUTE.
&gt;&gt; GREAT MOVE. THAT WILL STICK ANY DB.
&gt;&gt; OH. YEAH, YEAH.
&gt;&gt; YOU GOT TIME TO THROW THAT. &gt;&gt; HEY, 10-10.
WE GOT AN ENTERTAINING GAME AND LOTS TO COME HERE IN THE SECOND
HALF. A BIG HALFTIME SHOW IN THE
MEANTIME THE NFL'S ENDING ITS 11th WEEK ON FOREIGN SOIL IF YOU
WILL, WHAT DID WE SEE YESTERDAY, BASIC PART OF THE GAME OR SO WE
THOUGHT. PROVED AWFULLY HARD TO EXECUTE.
12 MISSED EXTRA POINTS. COUPLE OF ON THE SAME SIDE OF
THE FIELD. NOTHING IS A GIVEN.
HE THEME OF THE SEASON AS IT'S UNFOLDED REMAINS THE SAME.
OUR DISTINCTIVE AMERICAN HOLIDAY COMING UP, THAT BEING
THANKSGIVING, AND A TEAM THAT ANNUALLY PLAYS AT HOME ON
THANKSGIVING, THE TEAM THAT DUBBED ITSELF AMERICA'S TEAM A
LONG TIME AGO, ALSO MEXICO'S TEAM, THEY HAVEN'T LOST SINCE
THE CALENDAR SAID IT WAS SUMMER, HOW ABOUT THEM COWBOYS?
THAT'S HOW WE START OUR FINAL DRIVE.
OF COURSE, THE START FROM THE START OF THE YEAR, DAK PRESCOTT
AND TONY ROMO IN UNIFORM BACKING UP.
EZEKIEL ELLIOTT AND THE COWBOYS LEAPING OVER EVERYBODY WITH
EIGHT STRAIGHT WINS. THEY HAD TROUBLE EARLY AGAINST
BALTIMORE. HOW ABOUT STEVE SMITH?
JASON GARRETT'S COWBOYS SAID, WAY TO GO, WE RESPECT THAT.
MEANWHILE, DAK TO DEZ TWICE LATE AND HOW ABOUT THEM COWBOYS?
THEY'RE 9-1. RUSSELL WILSON, HOW DOES HE MAKE
AT LEAST THROWS? JIMMY GRAHAM FOR THE TOUCHDOWN,
RUSSELL WILSON, HOW DOES HE CATCH THESE THROWS FROM DOUG
BALDWIN? SEAHAWKS, HERE DELAY COME.
7-2-1. FOR THE GIANTS, SPENT A LOT OF
MONEY ON DEFENSE. BUT THEIR DRAFT PICK LANDON
COLLINS HAS BEEN THEIR BEST PLAYER, THEY'RE 7-3.
THE YOUNG TOM BRADY, FIRST TIME AS A PRO HE'S PLAYED IN SAN
FRANCISCO, HE'S STILL YOUNG TOM BRADY, IT'S MALCOLM MITCHELL THE
PATRIOTS ARE 8-2, THEY BEAT THE NINERS.
NOT ONCE BUT TWICE, XAIF RER RHODES OF MINNESOTA,
ARRIBAARRIBA. IT'S 100 YARDS.
ON THE KICKOFF, CORDARRELLE PATTERSON, HE'S ON HIS WAY.
HE'S GONE, GONE, 200 YARD PLAYS LIKE THAT.
THE VIKINGS ARE 6-2. TAMPA DID IT TO ALEX SMITH AND
THE CHIEFS. JARED GOFF FIRST START.
BUT THE FINISH WAS RYAN TANNEHILL, TWO TOUCHDOWNS IN THE
LAST 4:00. OF COURSE THEY WON IN THE L.A.
SOL SEEM BECAUSE ONCE UPON A TIME HISTORY WAS MADE THAT'S
WHERE THE DOLPHINS AND DON SHULA IN '72 FINISHED THEIR PERFECT
SEASON. THANKS TO OUR FRIENDS FOR
POINTING THAT ONE OUT. A QUICK LOOK TO THANKSGIVING
TELLS US, I OWE THEM ONE, IN ALL THREE GAMES, FIRST-PLACE TEAMS
WILL BE IN ACTION JUST AS TONIGHT HERE AT ESTADIO AZTECA.
WE GOT FIRST PLACE TEAMS. THAT'S MY TAKE ON THE WEEK.
I'M DONE. &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY SET
OLYMPIC RECORDS HERE IN '68. WHAT'S YOUR TAKE.
&gt;&gt; RUSSELL WILSON IS HEALTHY. HE DOES THINGS THAT MOST GUYS
DON'T KNOW THE WHOLE FIELD.  TO ME, RUSS SILL WILSON IS
PLAYING AS WELL AS ANYBODY IN THE SEAHAWKS, BAD FIRST HALF NOT
BAD BUT NOT AS GOOD AS THE SECOND HALF.
RUSS SILL WILSON SEEMS TO BE COMING ON JUST IN TIME.
&gt;&gt; THIS HOME STRETCH, KIRK COUSINS OF THE WASHINGTON
REDSKINS. THEIR OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR GOT
THEIR RUN GAME GOING. KIRK COUSINS IS GOING TO GET
PAID. &gt;&gt; MY TAKEAWAY, THE DETROIT
LIONS, NO CALVIN JOHNSON, TIED FOR FIRST PLACE WITH THE
MINNESOTA VIKINGS. BIG GAME COMING UP THIS THURSDAY
ON THANKSGIVING FOR SOLE POSSESSION OF FIRST PLACE.
MATTHEW STAFFORD IS PLAYING LIGHTS OUT.
THEY'RE USING THE WHOLE 60 MINUTES TO GET WINS.
THE DETROIT LIONS. J WHAT HAS EVERY COACH TOLD YOU
SINCE POP WARNER, FINISH. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT FINISHED HERE IN
OUR TOYOTA HALFTIME IN 10-10 GAME.
ADAM SCHEFTER COMING UP NEXT. QUARTERBACK INJURIES TO REPORT
ON AND LUCK TO CUTLER AND MORE. WE'LL BE BACK IN TWO MINUTES.</description>

      <description>THE SIGHTS FROM MEXICO CITY.
&gt;&gt;&gt; WELCOME INTO THE FIRST TAKE DESK.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.
STEPHEN A. SMITH AND MAX KELLERMAN.
GENTLEMEN, HOW ABOUT THEM COWBOYS?
THEY'RE ROLLING, 9-1. STEPHEN A., IS DAK THE NFL MVP
RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; NO, HE'S HAVING A VERY GOOD
YEAR. HE'S INCREDIBLY IMPRESSIVE.
BUT THATS ONNIVE LINE WE ZEEK YELL ELLIOTT IS TO ME IS MORE OF
AN MVP CONVERSATION THAN DAK PRESCOTT, TOM BRADY, MATT RYAN.
&gt;&gt; DAK PRESCOTT HAS THE HIGHEST QBR IN THE LEAGUE OTHER THAN A
QUARTERBACK NAMED BRADY. YOU CAN PUT A LOT OF
QUARTERBACKS BEHIND THAT OFFENSIVE LINE, ANDREW LUCK,
RUSSELL WILSON, THEY DON'T PLAY BEHIND THAT LINE.
DAK PRESCOTT DOES -- AT THIS MOMENT, HE'S THE MVP.
&gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS THERE ARE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO CAN BEAT DAK
PRESCOTT BUT NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO CAN BEAT E STEEK YELL
ELLIOTT. I'M JUST SAYIN'.
BACK PRESCOTT IS VERY IMPRESSIVE.
I'M SORRY, I GAVE YOU THREE OTHERS TO YOU THAT HAVE MORE OF
AN ONUS. &gt;&gt; DAK'S A ROOKIE.
&gt;&gt; DEFINITELY IN THE CONVERSATION AS WELL.
THANK YOU FOR HANGING WITH US. CATCH EVERY MONDAY THROUGH
FRIDAY 10:00 A.M. EASTERN.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; WELCOME BACK HERE TO ESTADIO
AZTECA. IT'S 10-10, HOUSTON AND OAKLAND
AT HALFTIME. WE'RE JOINED BY ADAM SCHEFTER
WHO'S LITERALLY HOLDING DOWN THE FORT IN BRISTOL, CONNECTICUT,
GOOD EVENING TO YOU, SCHEFTY. QUICK TURNAROUND FOR THE COLTS.
EXCITED TO PLAY A THURSDAY NIGHT THANKSGIVING GAME AGAINST
PITTSBURGH STEELERS. &gt;&gt; SHORT WEEK WILL MAKE IT
DIFFICULT FOR ANDREW LUCK TO PLAY THURSDAY NIGHT, BOOM, WHEN
YOU TALK TO PLAYERS THEY KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO BE
CLEARED FROM CONCUSSION PROTOCOL.
IF HE CAN'T PLAY ON THURSDAY NIGHT, STEVE TOELZEN WILL PLAY.
&gt;&gt; QUITE A CHANGE THE STEELERS HAVE HAD TO SIT BEN FOR A COUPLE
WEEKS. JAY CUTLER, THE LAST OF HIM IN
THE BEARS UNIFORM. &gt;&gt; QUITE POSSIBLY.
HE HAS SHOULDER INJURY BEING EVALUATED TO SEE IF IT'S A
SEASON-ENDING INJURY. IF IT IS, THE BEARS ARE LIKELY
TO MOVE ON FROM HIM ATTEND OF THE SEASON.
THEY STARTED CUTLER, THEY LOST BRIAN HOYER TO A SEASON-ENDING
INJURY AND NOW THE START B QUARTERBACK, IF CUTLER CAN'T
PLAY WOULD BE MATT BARKLEY. RYAN FITZPATRICK IS BACK AS THE
STARTING QUARTERBACK OF THE NEW YORK JETS.
GOOD NEWS FROM ARIZONA, BRUCE ARIANS WAS RELOOSED FROM THE
HOSPITAL. I'M TOLD HE'S EXPECTED BACK AT
WORK THIS WEEK WHICH GIVES HIM A REAL CHANCE TO COACH ON SUNDAY,
ATLANTA AGAINST THE FALCONS. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, SCHEFTY.
HAPPY HEALTHY.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; AROUND THE HORN, CHARLES,
SECOND HALF TEAM, TIED GAME. &gt;&gt; OBVIOUSLY, DROPS BY THE
OAKLAND RAIDERS. CLEAN FOOTBALL FOR THE RAIDERS
TO TRY AND EXTEND WHAT -- I THINK THE BETTER TEAM THEY SHOW
IN THE SECOND HALF HAS TO PLAY CLEANER.
&gt;&gt; UNLEASH DEREK CARR, ONE OF THE BIGGEST SUPERSTARS IN OUR
LEAGUE. MVP CANDIDATE.
UNLEASH HIM. &gt;&gt; UNLEASH HIM.
THEY GOT TO CATCH THE BALL. MICHAEL CRABTREE DROPS THE THIRD
AND FIVE PASS. WHEN THE HOUSTON TEXANS HAVE
MOMENTUM, YOU GOT TO STOP THAT MOMENTUM BY CATCHING THE BALL.
YOU WANT TO UNLEASH DEREK, CATCH THE BALL, BABY, CATCH THE BALL.
&gt;&gt; HEY, RAIDERS KNOW WHAT'S AT STAKE.
HOUSTON KNOWS WHAT'S AT STAKE THEY CAN GO UP TWO IN THE
DIVISION. WE KNOW WHAT'S AT STAKE, WE WANT
TO WISH EVERYONE A HAPPY THANKSGIVING.
10-10 GAME. ENJOY THE SECOND HALF,
EVERYBODY. LET'S GO PLACES.G NEW CARS.      YOYOU'RE SMART.
     YOU ALREADY KNEW THAT. BUT IT'S ALSO GREAT FOR FINDING
THE PERFECT USED CAR.</description>

      <description>KEEP AN EYE ON FULLER ON THE
SQUARE IN. I THINK THAT'S WHERE BILL
O'BRIEN WANTS THIS BALL TO GO. HE'S WIDE OPEN, THERE'S NO ONE
THERE. HERE'S THE PREGAME GRINDER,
MALCOLM SMITH, THE EX-SUPER BOWL MVP OF THE SEATTLE SEAHAWKS.
AND OSWEILER CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE WITH TURNOVERS.
BE CAREFUL OUT OF THE SUDDEN CHANGE.
COOPER AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN HAS BEEN AWFULLY QUIET
WORKING AGAINST A.J. BOUYE. &gt;&gt; Sean: FROM MIDFIELD, 1:30 TO
GO. CARR, ANOTHER DROP, THIS ONE BY
SETH ROBERTS, HIS SECOND WITHIN A MATTER OF MOMENTS.
&gt;&gt; Jon: ROBERTS HAS BEEN A VERY CLUTCH SLOT RECEIVER AND DEREK
CARR DISAPPOINTED OBVIOUSLY ON SECOND DOWN.
WILL ROMEO CRENNEL BRING SOME HEAT?
CLOWNEY AT TOP OF THE SCREEN HAS GIVEN AUSTIN HOWARD FITS.
&gt;&gt; Sean: OAKLAND POSSESSION, SET UP BY THE FOURTH CAREER
INTERCEPTION BY MALCOLM SMITH. A HUGE ONE WHILE A SEAHAWK IN
THE SUPER BOWL, WIN OVER DENVER. ACROSS THE MIDDLE.
LATAVIUS MURRAY, ANKLE TACKLED SHORT OF FIRST DOWN.
&gt;&gt; Jon: GOOD TACK LING SECONDARY AND I LIKE WATCHING ROMEO'S
DEFENSES AS THEY SPIN THE DIAL IN THE TWO-MINUTE DRILL.
THEY NEVER PLAY THE SAME COVERAGE BACK-TO-BACK PLAYS AND
THEY DISGUISE THEM WELL. &gt;&gt; Sean: INSIDE HANDOFF, MURRAY
COULDN'T FIND ANY RUNNING ROOM. HE GETS THROWN DOWN.
JADEVEON CLOWNEY AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PILE, WITH HELP UP TOP BY
ANDRE HAL. THE CLOCK RUNS TO 50 SECONDS
LEFT IN HALF. &gt;&gt; Jon: THE HOUSTON TEXANS HAVE
DONE IT ON GOAL LINE. THEY HAVE REJECTED THIS RUNNING
GAME. PENETRATION. SHEDDING BLOCKS.
&gt;&gt; Sean: THEY NIGHT TRY A FIELD GOAL, 58 YARDS BUT HERE AT
ALTITUDE, JANIKWSKI, MORE 50-YARD FIELD GOALS THAN ANY
OTHER PLAYER IN LEAGUE HISTORY, 55 OF THEM.
THEY'RE GOING FOR IT ON FOURTH AND ONE.
AND THE RECEIVER, CRABTREE WITH THE BALL EN ROUTE.
JOHNATHAN JOSEPH HAD THE COVERAGE AND OAKLAND TURNS IT
OVER DOWNS. &gt;&gt; Jon: THAT'S STRENGTH OF THIS
TEXANS DEFENSE, THESE CORNERS CAN LOCK YOU DOWN. KAREEM JACKSON.
&gt;&gt; Sean: WE'LL SEE HOW BILL O'BRIEN ELECTS TO THROW IT.
ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST HALF UPCOMING.
CHRIS BERMAN WILL HIS FINAL DRIVE.
THE SUBJECT, DAK PRESCOTT AND TOM BRADY AND THE LATEST NEWS
AND NOTES FROM AROUND THE NFL FROM THE GREAT ADAM SCHEFTER.
THREE RECEIVERS TO THE LEFT. WILL THEY TRY TO THROW A DEEP
BALL? OSWEILER THROWS IT SHORT.
MINIMAL GAIN TO BRAXTON MILLER, JACK DEL RIO SAYING IT SHOULD BE
INCOMPLETE. THE BALL CAME OUT AT THE END OF
THE PLAY. REALLY DOESN'T MATTER.
THEY GAINED ONE YARD. &gt;&gt; Jon: WITH NINE SECONDS LEFT,
THE ONLY THING THAT THE TEXANS CAN DO OBVIOUSLY IS COMPLETE
TIME-OUT, LONG-RANGE FIELD GOAL AND MEANINGLESS CATCH AND THAT
WASTED A LOT OF TIME. OSWEILER, DEEP ARM.
OFF THE HANDS OF WILL FULLER THE SPEEDY ROOKIE.
OUT OF NOTRE DAME. RAN THE FASTEST TIME AT THE
COMBINE. EARLIER THIS YEAR.
4.28 IN HIS PRO DAY AT NOTRE DAME.
4.32 IN INDIANAPOLIS. &gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT NOW HE'S ONE-TRICK
PONY. HE CAN RUN DEEP ROUTES.
CREDIT AMERSON WITH THE COVER DOWN THE FIELD.
HE AND SMITH, TALL, RANGY, MAN TO MAN DEFENDERS AND HERE COMES
A HAIL MARY. PREVENT DEFENSE BY THE RAIDERS.
SIX OAKLAND RAIDERS DEEP IN COVERAGE.
&gt;&gt; Sean: PLAY CLOCK RUNNING OUT. OSWEILER UNDER DURESS AND SACKED
BY KHALIL MACK. THEY RENEW THEIR ACQUAINTANCE ON
THE FINAL PLAY OF THE FIRST HALF.
&gt;&gt; Jon: CAN'T BLOCK HIM ONE-ON-ONE.
NOT MANY PEOPLE CAN. SPEED RUSH, NO CHANCE.
END OF THE HALF. &gt;&gt; Sean: RAN RIGHT AROUND CHRIS
CLARK. AT THE HALF, 10-10 THE SCORE.
STAY TUNED FOR THE TOYOTA HALFTIME WITH CHRIS BERMAN RIGHT
AFTER THIS SHORT TIME-OUT.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; WELCOME, EVERYBODY, TO
TOYOTA HALFTIME SHOW. GLAD YOU COULD BE WITH US AT
ESTADIO AZTECA, HISTORIC NIGHT, MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL OUT OF THE
UNITED STATES, HERE IN MEXICO, LOT OF FUN.
CHRIS BERMAN ALONG WITH STEVE YOUNG, TRENT DILFER AND CHARLES
WOODSON. 10-10 FIRST HALF.
A LITTLE FIESTA GOING ON IN MEXICO CITY.
LONG HALFTIME SHOW. LET ME START WITH THE GUY WHO
HAS THE MOST VESTED INTEREST IN THIS HALF.
I THOUGHT THAT HOUSTON, CHARLES, CAME OUT, AN OAKLAND HOME GAME
HOUSTON CAME OUT AUTHORITATIVELY, DO YOU AGREE.
&gt;&gt; YES. I LIKED THE OAKLAND RAIDERS
TONIGHT STARTING OUT, ALLOWING THE TEXANS TO DRIVE DOWN THE
FIELD AND GET INTO FIELD GOAL RANGE AND ALLOWED THEM TO GET
THREE POINT. THE GOOD THING ABOUT IT IS, THEY
HOLD THEM TO THREE POINTS. THEIR SPECIAL TEAMS COMES ONE A
BIG INSIDE THE 20 YARD LINE. WE GOT A CHANCE TO GO UP 14-7 AT
THAT POINT AND YOU ONLY GET THREE POINTS OUT OF THAT.
WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO ASSERT YOUR DOMINANCE THE LEAGUE AND
GET TO THE POSTSEASON, THESE TYPE OF GAMES YOU HAVE TO TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF THIS AND COME OUT AND BE DOMINANT.
&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO DO IT UP FRONT. THIS OFFENSIVE LINE WE'VE BEEN STUDYING THEY DOMINATED THE BALL
AND THEY COME OUT AND THEY CAN'T MOVE ANYBODY.
&gt;&gt; JADEVEON IS HAVING HIS WAY. &gt;&gt; EIGHT OFFENSIVE LINEMEN IN
THE GAME TO MOVE PEOPLE, THEY'RE LOSING YARDS.
&gt;&gt; I THINK THAT'S THE NEWS IN THE FIRST HALF THE TEXANS BETTER
DEFENSIVELY THAN I THOUGHT AND OFFENSIVELY FINALLY SOME
EXPANSION. IT WAS LIKE OSWEILER COULDN'T
GET BEYOND THE 10 YARD LINE MARK.
THE TOUCHDOWN. &gt;&gt; GREAT ROUTE.
&gt;&gt; GREAT MOVE. THAT WILL STICK ANY DB.
&gt;&gt; OH. YEAH, YEAH.
&gt;&gt; YOU GOT TIME TO THROW THAT. &gt;&gt; HEY, 10-10.
WE GOT AN ENTERTAINING GAME AND LOTS TO COME HERE IN THE SECOND
HALF. A BIG HALFTIME SHOW IN THE
MEANTIME THE NFL'S ENDING ITS 11th WEEK ON FOREIGN SOIL IF YOU
WILL, WHAT DID WE SEE YESTERDAY, BASIC PART OF THE GAME OR SO WE
THOUGHT. PROVED AWFULLY HARD TO EXECUTE.
12 MISSED EXTRA POINTS. COUPLE OF ON THE SAME SIDE OF
THE FIELD. NOTHING IS A GIVEN.
HE THEME OF THE SEASON AS IT'S UNFOLDED REMAINS THE SAME.
OUR DISTINCTIVE AMERICAN HOLIDAY COMING UP, THAT BEING
THANKSGIVING, AND A TEAM THAT ANNUALLY PLAYS AT HOME ON
THANKSGIVING, THE TEAM THAT DUBBED ITSELF AMERICA'S TEAM A
LONG TIME AGO, ALSO MEXICO'S TEAM, THEY HAVEN'T LOST SINCE
THE CALENDAR SAID IT WAS SUMMER, HOW ABOUT THEM COWBOYS?
THAT'S HOW WE START OUR FINAL DRIVE.
OF COURSE, THE START FROM THE START OF THE YEAR, DAK PRESCOTT
AND TONY ROMO IN UNIFORM BACKING UP.
EZEKIEL ELLIOTT AND THE COWBOYS LEAPING OVER EVERYBODY WITH
EIGHT STRAIGHT WINS. THEY HAD TROUBLE EARLY AGAINST
BALTIMORE. HOW ABOUT STEVE SMITH?
JASON GARRETT'S COWBOYS SAID, WAY TO GO, WE RESPECT THAT.
MEANWHILE, DAK TO DEZ TWICE LATE AND HOW ABOUT THEM COWBOYS?
THEY'RE 9-1. RUSSELL WILSON, HOW DOES HE MAKE
AT LEAST THROWS? JIMMY GRAHAM FOR THE TOUCHDOWN,
RUSSELL WILSON, HOW DOES HE CATCH THESE THROWS FROM DOUG
BALDWIN? SEAHAWKS, HERE DELAY COME.
7-2-1. FOR THE GIANTS, SPENT A LOT OF
MONEY ON DEFENSE. BUT THEIR DRAFT PICK LANDON
COLLINS HAS BEEN THEIR BEST PLAYER, THEY'RE 7-3.
THE YOUNG TOM BRADY, FIRST TIME AS A PRO HE'S PLAYED IN SAN
FRANCISCO, HE'S STILL YOUNG TOM BRADY, IT'S MALCOLM MITCHELL THE
PATRIOTS ARE 8-2, THEY BEAT THE NINERS.
NOT ONCE BUT TWICE, XAIF RER RHODES OF MINNESOTA,
ARRIBAARRIBA. IT'S 100 YARDS.
ON THE KICKOFF, CORDARRELLE PATTERSON, HE'S ON HIS WAY.
HE'S GONE, GONE, 200 YARD PLAYS LIKE THAT.
THE VIKINGS ARE 6-2. TAMPA DID IT TO ALEX SMITH AND
THE CHIEFS. JARED GOFF FIRST START.
BUT THE FINISH WAS RYAN TANNEHILL, TWO TOUCHDOWNS IN THE
LAST 4:00. OF COURSE THEY WON IN THE L.A.
SOL SEEM BECAUSE ONCE UPON A TIME HISTORY WAS MADE THAT'S
WHERE THE DOLPHINS AND DON SHULA IN '72 FINISHED THEIR PERFECT
SEASON. THANKS TO OUR FRIENDS FOR
POINTING THAT ONE OUT. A QUICK LOOK TO THANKSGIVING
TELLS US, I OWE THEM ONE, IN ALL THREE GAMES, FIRST-PLACE TEAMS
WILL BE IN ACTION JUST AS TONIGHT HERE AT ESTADIO AZTECA.
WE GOT FIRST PLACE TEAMS. THAT'S MY TAKE ON THE WEEK.
I'M DONE. &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY SET
OLYMPIC RECORDS HERE IN '68. WHAT'S YOUR TAKE.
&gt;&gt; RUSSELL WILSON IS HEALTHY. HE DOES THINGS THAT MOST GUYS
DON'T KNOW THE WHOLE FIELD.  TO ME, RUSS SILL WILSON IS
PLAYING AS WELL AS ANYBODY IN THE SEAHAWKS, BAD FIRST HALF NOT
BAD BUT NOT AS GOOD AS THE SECOND HALF.
RUSS SILL WILSON SEEMS TO BE COMING ON JUST IN TIME.
&gt;&gt; THIS HOME STRETCH, KIRK COUSINS OF THE WASHINGTON
REDSKINS. THEIR OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR GOT
THEIR RUN GAME GOING. KIRK COUSINS IS GOING TO GET
PAID. &gt;&gt; MY TAKEAWAY, THE DETROIT
LIONS, NO CALVIN JOHNSON, TIED FOR FIRST PLACE WITH THE
MINNESOTA VIKINGS. BIG GAME COMING UP THIS THURSDAY
ON THANKSGIVING FOR SOLE POSSESSION OF FIRST PLACE.
MATTHEW STAFFORD IS PLAYING LIGHTS OUT.
THEY'RE USING THE WHOLE 60 MINUTES TO GET WINS.
THE DETROIT LIONS. J WHAT HAS EVERY COACH TOLD YOU
SINCE POP WARNER, FINISH. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT FINISHED HERE IN
OUR TOYOTA HALFTIME IN 10-10 GAME.
ADAM SCHEFTER COMING UP NEXT. QUARTERBACK INJURIES TO REPORT
ON AND LUCK TO CUTLER AND MORE. WE'LL BE BACK IN TWO MINUTES.</description>

      <description>THE SIGHTS FROM MEXICO CITY.
&gt;&gt;&gt; WELCOME INTO THE FIRST TAKE DESK.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.
STEPHEN A. SMITH AND MAX KELLERMAN.
GENTLEMEN, HOW ABOUT THEM COWBOYS?
THEY'RE ROLLING, 9-1. STEPHEN A., IS DAK THE NFL MVP
RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; NO, HE'S HAVING A VERY GOOD
YEAR. HE'S INCREDIBLY IMPRESSIVE.
BUT THATS ONNIVE LINE WE ZEEK YELL ELLIOTT IS TO ME IS MORE OF
AN MVP CONVERSATION THAN DAK PRESCOTT, TOM BRADY, MATT RYAN.
&gt;&gt; DAK PRESCOTT HAS THE HIGHEST QBR IN THE LEAGUE OTHER THAN A
QUARTERBACK NAMED BRADY. YOU CAN PUT A LOT OF
QUARTERBACKS BEHIND THAT OFFENSIVE LINE, ANDREW LUCK,
RUSSELL WILSON, THEY DON'T PLAY BEHIND THAT LINE.
DAK PRESCOTT DOES -- AT THIS MOMENT, HE'S THE MVP.
&gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS THERE ARE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO CAN BEAT DAK
PRESCOTT BUT NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO CAN BEAT E STEEK YELL
ELLIOTT. I'M JUST SAYIN'.
BACK PRESCOTT IS VERY IMPRESSIVE.
I'M SORRY, I GAVE YOU THREE OTHERS TO YOU THAT HAVE MORE OF
AN ONUS. &gt;&gt; DAK'S A ROOKIE.
&gt;&gt; DEFINITELY IN THE CONVERSATION AS WELL.
THANK YOU FOR HANGING WITH US. CATCH EVERY MONDAY THROUGH

THEY STARTED CUTLER, THEY LOST BRIAN HOYER TO A SEASON-ENDING
INJURY AND NOW THE START B QUARTERBACK, IF CUTLER CAN'T
PLAY WOULD BE MATT BARKLEY. RYAN FITZPATRICK IS BACK AS THE
STARTING QUARTERBACK OF THE NEW YORK JETS.
GOOD NEWS FROM ARIZONA, BRUCE ARIANS WAS RELOOSED FROM THE
HOSPITAL. I'M TOLD HE'S EXPECTED BACK AT
WORK THIS WEEK WHICH GIVES HIM A REAL CHANCE TO COACH ON SUNDAY,
ATLANTA AGAINST THE FALCONS. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, SCHEFTY.
HAPPY HEALTHY.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; AROUND THE HORN, CHARLES,
SECOND HALF TEAM, TIED GAME. &gt;&gt; OBVIOUSLY, DROPS BY THE
OAKLAND RAIDERS. CLEAN FOOTBALL FOR THE RAIDERS
TO TRY AND EXTEND WHAT -- I THINK THE BETTER TEAM THEY SHOW
IN THE SECOND HALF HAS TO PLAY CLEANER.
&gt;&gt; UNLEASH DEREK CARR, ONE OF THE BIGGEST SUPERSTARS IN OUR
LEAGUE. MVP CANDIDATE.
UNLEASH HIM. &gt;&gt; UNLEASH HIM.
THEY GOT TO CATCH THE BALL. MICHAEL CRABTREE DROPS THE THIRD
AND FIVE PASS. WHEN THE HOUSTON TEXANS HAVE
MOMENTUM, YOU GOT TO STOP THAT MOMENTUM BY CATCHING THE BALL.
YOU WANT TO UNLEASH DEREK, CATCH THE BALL, BABY, CATCH THE BALL.
&gt;&gt; HEY, RAIDERS KNOW WHAT'S AT STAKE.
HOUSTON KNOWS WHAT'S AT STAKE THEY CAN GO UP TWO IN THE
DIVISION. WE KNOW WHAT'S AT STAKE, WE WANT
TO WISH EVERYONE A HAPPY THANKSGIVING.
10-10 GAME. ENJOY THE SECOND HALF,
EVERYBODY. LET'S GO PLACES.G NEW CARS.      YOYOU'RE SMART.
     YOU ALREADY KNEW THAT. BUT IT'S ALSO GREAT FOR FINDING
THE PERFECT USED CAR.</description>

      <description>KEEP AN EYE ON FULLER ON THE
SQUARE IN. I THINK THAT'S WHERE BILL
O'BRIEN WANTS THIS BALL TO GO. HE'S WIDE OPEN, THERE'S NO ONE
THERE. HERE'S THE PREGAME GRINDER,
MALCOLM SMITH, THE EX-SUPER BOWL MVP OF THE SEATTLE SEAHAWKS.
AND OSWEILER CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE WITH TURNOVERS.
BE CAREFUL OUT OF THE SUDDEN CHANGE.
COOPER AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN HAS BEEN AWFULLY QUIET
WORKING AGAINST A.J. BOUYE. &gt;&gt; Sean: FROM MIDFIELD, 1:30 TO
GO. CARR, ANOTHER DROP, THIS ONE BY
SETH ROBERTS, HIS SECOND WITHIN A MATTER OF MOMENTS.
&gt;&gt; Jon: ROBERTS HAS BEEN A VERY CLUTCH SLOT RECEIVER AND DEREK
CARR DISAPPOINTED OBVIOUSLY ON SECOND DOWN.
WILL ROMEO CRENNEL BRING SOME HEAT?
CLOWNEY AT TOP OF THE SCREEN HAS GIVEN AUSTIN HOWARD FITS.
&gt;&gt; Sean: OAKLAND POSSESSION, SET UP BY THE FOURTH CAREER
INTERCEPTION BY MALCOLM SMITH. A HUGE ONE WHILE A SEAHAWK IN
THE SUPER BOWL, WIN OVER DENVER. ACROSS THE MIDDLE.
LATAVIUS MURRAY, ANKLE TACKLED SHORT OF FIRST DOWN.
&gt;&gt; Jon: GOOD TACK LING SECONDARY AND I LIKE WATCHING ROMEO'S
DEFENSES AS THEY SPIN THE DIAL IN THE TWO-MINUTE DRILL.
THEY NEVER PLAY THE SAME COVERAGE BACK-TO-BACK PLAYS AND
THEY DISGUISE THEM WELL. &gt;&gt; Sean: INSIDE HANDOFF, MURRAY
COULDN'T FIND ANY RUNNING ROOM. HE GETS THROWN DOWN.
JADEVEON CLOWNEY AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PILE, WITH HELP UP TOP BY
ANDRE HAL. THE CLOCK RUNS TO 50 SECONDS
LEFT IN HALF. &gt;&gt; Jon: THE HOUSTON TEXANS HAVE
DONE IT ON GOAL LINE. THEY HAVE REJECTED THIS RUNNING
GAME. PENETRATION. SHEDDING BLOCKS.
&gt;&gt; Sean: THEY NIGHT TRY A FIELD GOAL, 58 YARDS BUT HERE AT
ALTITUDE, JANIKWSKI, MORE 50-YARD FIELD GOALS THAN ANY
OTHER PLAYER IN LEAGUE HISTORY, 55 OF THEM.
THEY'RE GOING FOR IT ON FOURTH AND ONE.
AND THE RECEIVER, CRABTREE WITH THE BALL EN ROUTE.
JOHNATHAN JOSEPH HAD THE COVERAGE AND OAKLAND TURNS IT
OVER DOWNS. &gt;&gt; Jon: THAT'S STRENGTH OF THIS
TEXANS DEFENSE, THESE CORNERS CAN LOCK YOU DOWN. KAREEM JACKSON.
&gt;&gt; Sean: WE'LL SEE HOW BILL O'BRIEN ELECTS TO THROW IT.
ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST HALF UPCOMING.
CHRIS BERMAN WILL HIS FINAL DRIVE.
THE SUBJECT, DAK PRESCOTT AND TOM BRADY AND THE LATEST NEWS
AND NOTES FROM AROUND THE NFL FROM THE GREAT ADAM SCHEFTER.
THREE RECEIVERS TO THE LEFT. WILL THEY TRY TO THROW A DEEP
BALL? OSWEILER THROWS IT SHORT.
MINIMAL GAIN TO BRAXTON MILLER, JACK DEL RIO SAYING IT SHOULD BE
INCOMPLETE. THE BALL CAME OUT AT THE END OF
THE PLAY. REALLY DOESN'T MATTER.
THEY GAINED ONE YARD. &gt;&gt; Jon: WITH NINE SECONDS LEFT,
THE ONLY THING THAT THE TEXANS CAN DO OBVIOUSLY IS COMPLETE
TIME-OUT, LONG-RANGE FIELD GOAL AND MEANINGLESS CATCH AND THAT
WASTED A LOT OF TIME. OSWEILER, DEEP ARM.
OFF THE HANDS OF WILL FULLER THE SPEEDY ROOKIE.
OUT OF NOTRE DAME. RAN THE FASTEST TIME AT THE
COMBINE. EARLIER THIS YEAR.
4.28 IN HIS PRO DAY AT NOTRE DAME.
4.32 IN INDIANAPOLIS. &gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT NOW HE'S ONE-TRICK
PONY. HE CAN RUN DEEP ROUTES.
CREDIT AMERSON WITH THE COVER DOWN THE FIELD.
HE AND SMITH, TALL, RANGY, MAN TO MAN DEFENDERS AND HERE COMES
A HAIL MARY. PREVENT DEFENSE BY THE RAIDERS.
SIX OAKLAND RAIDERS DEEP IN COVERAGE.
&gt;&gt; Sean: PLAY CLOCK RUNNING OUT. OSWEILER UNDER DURESS AND SACKED
BY KHALIL MACK. THEY RENEW THEIR ACQUAINTANCE ON
THE FINAL PLAY OF THE FIRST HALF.
&gt;&gt; Jon: CAN'T BLOCK HIM ONE-ON-ONE.
NOT MANY PEOPLE CAN. SPEED RUSH, NO CHANCE.
END OF THE HALF. &gt;&gt; Sean: RAN RIGHT AROUND CHRIS
CLARK. AT THE HALF, 10-10 THE SCORE.
STAY TUNED FOR THE TOYOTA HALFTIME WITH CHRIS BERMAN RIGHT
AFTER THIS SHORT TIME-OUT.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; WELCOME, EVERYBODY, TO
TOYOTA HALFTIME SHOW. GLAD YOU COULD BE WITH US AT
ESTADIO AZTECA, HISTORIC NIGHT, MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL OUT OF THE
UNITED STATES, HERE IN MEXICO, LOT OF FUN.
CHRIS BERMAN ALONG WITH STEVE YOUNG, TRENT DILFER AND CHARLES
WOODSON. 10-10 FIRST HALF.
A LITTLE FIESTA GOING ON IN MEXICO CITY.
LONG HALFTIME SHOW. LET ME START WITH THE GUY WHO
HAS THE MOST VESTED INTEREST IN THIS HALF.
I THOUGHT THAT HOUSTON, CHARLES, CAME OUT, AN OAKLAND HOME GAME
HOUSTON CAME OUT AUTHORITATIVELY, DO YOU AGREE.
&gt;&gt; YES. I LIKED THE OAKLAND RAIDERS
TONIGHT STARTING OUT, ALLOWING THE TEXANS TO DRIVE DOWN THE
FIELD AND GET INTO FIELD GOAL RANGE AND ALLOWED THEM TO GET
THREE POINT. THE GOOD THING ABOUT IT IS, THEY
HOLD THEM TO THREE POINTS. THEIR SPECIAL TEAMS COMES ONE A
BIG INSIDE THE 20 YARD LINE. WE GOT A CHANCE TO GO UP 14-7 AT
THAT POINT AND YOU ONLY GET THREE POINTS OUT OF THAT.
WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO ASSERT YOUR DOMINANCE THE LEAGUE AND
GET TO THE POSTSEASON, THESE TYPE OF GAMES YOU HAVE TO TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF THIS AND COME OUT AND BE DOMINANT.
&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO DO IT UP FRONT. THIS OFFENSIVE LINE WE'VE BEEN STUDYING THEY DOMINATED THE BALL
AND THEY COME OUT AND THEY CAN'T MOVE ANYBODY.
&gt;&gt; JADEVEON IS HAVING HIS WAY. &gt;&gt; EIGHT OFFENSIVE LINEMEN IN
THE GAME TO MOVE PEOPLE, THEY'RE LOSING YARDS.
&gt;&gt; I THINK THAT'S THE NEWS IN THE FIRST HALF THE TEXANS BETTER
DEFENSIVELY THAN I THOUGHT AND OFFENSIVELY FINALLY SOME
EXPANSION. IT WAS LIKE OSWEILER COULDN'T
GET BEYOND THE 10 YARD LINE MARK.
THE TOUCHDOWN. &gt;&gt; GREAT ROUTE.
&gt;&gt; GREAT MOVE. THAT WILL STICK ANY DB.
&gt;&gt; OH. YEAH, YEAH.
&gt;&gt; YOU GOT TIME TO THROW THAT. &gt;&gt; HEY, 10-10.
WE GOT AN ENTERTAINING GAME AND LOTS TO COME HERE IN THE SECOND
HALF. A BIG HALFTIME SHOW IN THE
MEANTIME THE NFL'S ENDING ITS 11th WEEK ON FOREIGN SOIL IF YOU
WILL, WHAT DID WE SEE YESTERDAY, BASIC PART OF THE GAME OR SO WE
THOUGHT. PROVED AWFULLY HARD TO EXECUTE.
12 MISSED EXTRA POINTS. COUPLE OF ON THE SAME SIDE OF
THE FIELD. NOTHING IS A GIVEN.
HE THEME OF THE SEASON AS IT'S UNFOLDED REMAINS THE SAME.
OUR DISTINCTIVE AMERICAN HOLIDAY COMING UP, THAT BEING
THANKSGIVING, AND A TEAM THAT ANNUALLY PLAYS AT HOME ON
THANKSGIVING, THE TEAM THAT DUBBED ITSELF AMERICA'S TEAM A
LONG TIME AGO, ALSO MEXICO'S TEAM, THEY HAVEN'T LOST SINCE
THE CALENDAR SAID IT WAS SUMMER, HOW ABOUT THEM COWBOYS?
THAT'S HOW WE START OUR FINAL DRIVE.
OF COURSE, THE START FROM THE START OF THE YEAR, DAK PRESCOTT
AND TONY ROMO IN UNIFORM BACKING UP.
EZEKIEL ELLIOTT AND THE COWBOYS LEAPING OVER EVERYBODY WITH
EIGHT STRAIGHT WINS. THEY HAD TROUBLE EARLY AGAINST
BALTIMORE. HOW ABOUT STEVE SMITH?
JASON GARRETT'S COWBOYS SAID, WAY TO GO, WE RESPECT THAT.
MEANWHILE, DAK TO DEZ TWICE LATE AND HOW ABOUT THEM COWBOYS?
THEY'RE 9-1. RUSSELL WILSON, HOW DOES HE MAKE
AT LEAST THROWS? JIMMY GRAHAM FOR THE TOUCHDOWN,
RUSSELL WILSON, HOW DOES HE CATCH THESE THROWS FROM DOUG
BALDWIN? SEAHAWKS, HERE DELAY COME.
7-2-1. FOR THE GIANTS, SPENT A LOT OF
MONEY ON DEFENSE. BUT THEIR DRAFT PICK LANDON
COLLINS HAS BEEN THEIR BEST PLAYER, THEY'RE 7-3.
THE YOUNG TOM BRADY, FIRST TIME AS A PRO HE'S PLAYED IN SAN
FRANCISCO, HE'S STILL YOUNG TOM BRADY, IT'S MALCOLM MITCHELL THE
PATRIOTS ARE 8-2, THEY BEAT THE NINERS.
NOT ONCE BUT TWICE, XAIF RER RHODES OF MINNESOTA,
ARRIBAARRIBA. IT'S 100 YARDS.
ON THE KICKOFF, CORDARRELLE PATTERSON, HE'S ON HIS WAY.
HE'S GONE, GONE, 200 YARD PLAYS LIKE THAT.
THE VIKINGS ARE 6-2. TAMPA DID IT TO ALEX SMITH AND
THE CHIEFS. JARED GOFF FIRST START.
BUT THE FINISH WAS RYAN TANNEHILL, TWO TOUCHDOWNS IN THE
LAST 4:00. OF COURSE THEY WON IN THE L.A.
SOL SEEM BECAUSE ONCE UPON A TIME HISTORY WAS MADE THAT'S
WHERE THE DOLPHINS AND DON SHULA IN '72 FINISHED THEIR PERFECT
SEASON. THANKS TO OUR FRIENDS FOR
POINTING THAT ONE OUT. A QUICK LOOK TO THANKSGIVING
TELLS US, I OWE THEM ONE, IN ALL THREE GAMES, FIRST-PLACE TEAMS
WILL BE IN ACTION JUST AS TONIGHT HERE AT ESTADIO AZTECA.
WE GOT FIRST PLACE TEAMS. THAT'S MY TAKE ON THE WEEK.
I'M DONE. &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY SET
OLYMPIC RECORDS HERE IN '68. WHAT'S YOUR TAKE.
&gt;&gt; RUSSELL WILSON IS HEALTHY. HE DOES THINGS THAT MOST GUYS
DON'T KNOW THE WHOLE FIELD.  TO ME, RUSS SILL WILSON IS
PLAYING AS WELL AS ANYBODY IN THE SEAHAWKS, BAD FIRST HALF NOT
BAD BUT NOT AS GOOD AS THE SECOND HALF.
RUSS SILL WILSON SEEMS TO BE COMING ON JUST IN TIME.
&gt;&gt; THIS HOME STRETCH, KIRK COUSINS OF THE WASHINGTON
REDSKINS. THEIR OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR GOT
THEIR RUN GAME GOING. KIRK COUSINS IS GOING TO GET
PAID. &gt;&gt; MY TAKEAWAY, THE DETROIT
LIONS, NO CALVIN JOHNSON, TIED FOR FIRST PLACE WITH THE
MINNESOTA VIKINGS. BIG GAME COMING UP THIS THURSDAY
ON THANKSGIVING FOR SOLE POSSESSION OF FIRST PLACE.
MATTHEW STAFFORD IS PLAYING LIGHTS OUT.
THEY'RE USING THE WHOLE 60 MINUTES TO GET WINS.
THE DETROIT LIONS. J WHAT HAS EVERY COACH TOLD YOU
SINCE POP WARNER, FINISH. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT FINISHED HERE IN
OUR TOYOTA HALFTIME IN 10-10 GAME.
ADAM SCHEFTER COMING UP NEXT. QUARTERBACK INJURIES TO REPORT
ON AND LUCK TO CUTLER AND MORE. WE'LL BE BACK IN TWO MINUTES.</description>

      <description>THE SIGHTS FROM MEXICO CITY.
&gt;&gt;&gt; WELCOME INTO THE FIRST TAKE DESK.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.
STEPHEN A. SMITH AND MAX KELLERMAN.
GENTLEMEN, HOW ABOUT THEM COWBOYS?
THEY'RE ROLLING, 9-1. STEPHEN A., IS DAK THE NFL MVP
RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; NO, HE'S HAVING A VERY GOOD
YEAR. HE'S INCREDIBLY IMPRESSIVE.
BUT THATS ONNIVE LINE WE ZEEK YELL ELLIOTT IS TO ME IS MORE OF
AN MVP CONVERSATION THAN DAK PRESCOTT, TOM BRADY, MATT RYAN.
&gt;&gt; DAK PRESCOTT HAS THE HIGHEST QBR IN THE LEAGUE OTHER THAN A
QUARTERBACK NAMED BRADY. YOU CAN PUT A LOT OF
QUARTERBACKS BEHIND THAT OFFENSIVE LINE, ANDREW LUCK,
RUSSELL WILSON, THEY DON'T PLAY BEHIND THAT LINE.
DAK PRESCOTT DOES -- AT THIS MOMENT, HE'S THE MVP.
&gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS THERE ARE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO CAN BEAT DAK
PRESCOTT BUT NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO CAN BEAT E STEEK YELL
ELLIOTT. I'M JUST SAYIN'.
BACK PRESCOTT IS VERY IMPRESSIVE.
I'M SORRY, I GAVE YOU THREE OTHERS TO YOU THAT HAVE MORE OF
AN ONUS. &gt;&gt; DAK'S A ROOKIE.
&gt;&gt; DEFINITELY IN THE CONVERSATION AS WELL.
THANK YOU FOR HANGING WITH US. CATCH EVERY MONDAY THROUGH
FRIDAY 10:00 A.M. EASTERN.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; WELCOME BACK HERE TO ESTADIO
AZTECA. IT'S 10-10, HOUSTON AND OAKLAND
AT HALFTIME. WE'RE JOINED BY ADAM SCHEFTER
WHO'S LITERALLY HOLDING DOWN THE FORT IN BRISTOL, CONNECTICUT,
GOOD EVENING TO YOU, SCHEFTY. QUICK TURNAROUND FOR THE COLTS.
EXCITED TO PLAY A THURSDAY NIGHT THANKSGIVING GAME AGAINST
PITTSBURGH STEELERS. &gt;&gt; SHORT WEEK WILL MAKE IT
DIFFICULT FOR ANDREW LUCK TO PLAY THURSDAY NIGHT, BOOM, WHEN
YOU TALK TO PLAYERS THEY KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO BE
CLEARED FROM CONCUSSION PROTOCOL.
IF HE CAN'T PLAY ON THURSDAY NIGHT, STEVE TOELZEN WILL PLAY.
&gt;&gt; QUITE A CHANGE THE STEELERS HAVE HAD TO SIT BEN FOR A COUPLE
WEEKS. JAY CUTLER, THE LAST OF HIM IN
THE BEARS UNIFORM. &gt;&gt; QUITE POSSIBLY.
HE HAS SHOULDER INJURY BEING EVALUATED TO SEE IF IT'S A
SEASON-ENDING INJURY. IF IT IS, THE BEARS ARE LIKELY
TO MOVE ON FROM HIM ATTEND OF THE SEASON.
THEY STARTED CUTLER, THEY LOST BRIAN HOYER TO A SEASON-ENDING
INJURY AND NOW THE START B QUARTERBACK, IF CUTLER CAN'T
PLAY WOULD BE MATT BARKLEY. RYAN FITZPATRICK IS BACK AS THE
STARTING QUARTERBACK OF THE NEW YORK JETS.
GOOD NEWS FROM ARIZONA, BRUCE ARIANS WAS RELOOSED FROM THE
HOSPITAL. I'M TOLD HE'S EXPECTED BACK AT
WORK THIS WEEK WHICH GIVES HIM A REAL CHANCE TO COACH ON SUNDAY,
ATLANTA AGAINST THE FALCONS. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, SCHEFTY.
HAPPY HEALTHY.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; AROUND THE HORN, CHARLES,
SECOND HALF TEAM, TIED GAME. &gt;&gt; OBVIOUSLY, DROPS BY THE
OAKLAND RAIDERS. CLEAN FOOTBALL FOR THE RAIDERS
TO TRY AND EXTEND WHAT -- I THINK THE BETTER TEAM THEY SHOW
IN THE SECOND HALF HAS TO PLAY CLEANER.
&gt;&gt; UNLEASH DEREK CARR, ONE OF THE BIGGEST SUPERSTARS IN OUR
LEAGUE. MVP CANDIDATE.
UNLEASH HIM. &gt;&gt; UNLEASH HIM.
THEY GOT TO CATCH THE BALL. MICHAEL CRABTREE DROPS THE THIRD
AND FIVE PASS. WHEN THE HOUSTON TEXANS HAVE
MOMENTUM, YOU GOT TO STOP THAT MOMENTUM BY CATCHING THE BALL.
YOU WANT TO UNLEASH DEREK, CATCH THE BALL, BABY, CATCH THE BALL.
&gt;&gt; HEY, RAIDERS KNOW WHAT'S AT STAKE.
HOUSTON KNOWS WHAT'S AT STAKE THEY CAN GO UP TWO IN THE
DIVISION. WE KNOW WHAT'S AT STAKE, WE WANT
TO WISH EVERYONE A HAPPY THANKSGIVING.
10-10 GAME. ENJOY THE SECOND HALF,
EVERYBODY. LET'S GO PLACES.G NEW CARS.      YOYOU'RE SMART.
     YOU ALREADY KNEW THAT. BUT IT'S ALSO GREAT FOR FINDING
THE PERFECT USED CAR.</description>

      <description>SET OUT TO DO SO FAR.
DON'T GO AWAY, THIS MAN IS SECAL.
&gt;&gt; Sean: MM-HMM. PLAY-ACTION PASS.
AFTER THE FAKE TO PAUL PERKINS AND MANNING HAS IT DROPPED BY
WILL TYE. &gt;&gt; Jon: SOMEBODY HAS TO HELP ELI
MANNING OUT. YOU'RE STRUGGLING TO RUN THE
FOOTBALL. ROGER LEWIS DROPPED ONE IN THE
FIRST QUARTER. HERE'S WILL TYE FOR ANOTHER
FIRST DOWN, DROPPING THE FOOTBAL.
YOU DON'T WANT TO FALL BEHIND IN THE DOWN AND DISTANCE
CONTINUALLY IN THE NFL ESPECIALLY AGAINST DEFENSES THAT
CAN OVERWHELM YOU WITH PASS RUSHERS AND GENO ATKINS, NUMBER
97,s RED HOT RIGHT NOW FOR CINCINNATI.
&gt;&gt; Sean: MANNING, MAN OPEN, CAUGHT BY BECKHAM, FIRST DOWN
OUT TO THE 43 YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; Jon: WELL, ADAM JONES AT
CORNER GOT TO GET SOME DEPTH, DON'T LET HIM THROW THE DEEP
BALL TO BECKHAM, THROW THE SHORT BALL UNDERNEATH.
JONES KNOWS BETTER THAN THAT. &gt;&gt; Sean: 59 YARDS SEVENING,
EXACTLY 3500 FOR BECKHAM. AND MANNING GOING FOR HIM AGAIN,
THROW OUT OF BOUNDS. WITH A FLAG DOWN.
IT LOOKED LIKE DUNLAP WAS OFFSIDE FOR THE BENGALS
&gt;&gt; Referee: OFFSIDE, DEFENSE NUMBER 96, MOVED IN THE NEUTRAL
ZONE AT THE SNAP, FIVE-YARD PENALTY.
REPLAY THIRD DOWN. &gt;&gt; Sean: HISTORY BEING MADE IT
SEEMS ALMOST EVERY WEEK BY ODELL BECKHAM JR.
QUICKEST TO 3500 YARDS. RECEIVING.
36 GAMES. JERELL ADAMS CAUGHT THE GIANTS'
TOUCHDOWN PASS. IN THE FIRST QUARTER.
HE HAS A FIRST DOWN AT THE CINCINNATI 44 YARD LINE.
&gt;&gt; Jon: ADAMS IS ATHLETIC. CAUGHT 66 PASSES AT SOUTH
CAROLINA. AFTER THE BYE WEEK, BEN McADOO,
A FORMER TIGHT END COACH HIMSELF SAID, PUT THE YOUNG KID IN THERE
AND HE'S DONE WELL.  GAIN OF EIGHT.
&gt;&gt; Jon: PERKINS IS AN ALL-PURPOSE BACK.
ROOKIE OUT OF UCLA. HE CAN CATCH IT.
HE'S GOOD RUNNER. HE'S GOT GOOD VISION AND
INSTINCTS. GOT TO IMPROVE AS A ROUTE
RUNNER. BUT THIS IS NOT EASY BEING IN A
NO-HUDDLE OFFENSE WITH ELI MANNING.
YOU DON'T WANT THE PLAY IS UNTIL</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt; Sean: EVERY NFL STADIUM ON
GAME DAY AT LEAST 29 MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS ON HAND.
INCLUDING THE UNAFAIL YATED NEUROLOGICAL STAFF, DIAGNOSE
IN-GAME CONCUSSIONS. GIANTS ON THE MOVE AT THE
TWO-MINUTE WARNING, 1:57 TO GO IN THE HALF.
THEY'RE DOWN 10-7. FIRST AND TEN AT THE CINCINNATI

      <description>TO HAVE A GOOD LOOK AT IT.
AND THAT COMBINATION, BECKHAM AND MANNING IS UNBELIEVABLE.
31st TOUCHDOWN AND THEY'RE JUST GETTING WARMED UP.
&gt;&gt; Sean: EVERY PASS ODELL BECKHAM JR.'S CAUGHT IN HIS
CAREER HAS COME FROM ELI MANNING.
239 OF THEM NOW IN JUST HIS 3rd YEAR IN THE NFL.
EXTRA POINT GOOD BY ROBBIE GOULD.
THE GIANTS BACK ON TOP WITH 1:17 TO GO IN THE SECOND HALF.                          next gk</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt; Sean: ELI MANNING THE
TOUCHDOWN PASS TO ODELL BECKHAM JR.
&gt;&gt; Jon: BEAUTIFUL ROUTE. BY BECKHAM.
&gt;&gt; Sean: SIX TOUCHDOWN PASSES IN THE LAST FIVE GAMES, DIDN'T HAVE
ANY IN THEIR FIRST FOUR GAMES OF T SEASON.
ERICKSON. STOOD UP SHY OF THE 20 YARD
LINE. THE ROOKIE OUT OF NOTRE DAME --
&gt;&gt; Jon: WATCH THIS TOTAL REPLAY, SEAN, OF THE TOUCHDOWN.
ALL STARTS WITH GREAT PASS PROTECTION.
LEFT TACKLE FLOWERS, RIGHT TACKLE BOBBY HART DOING A GREAT
JOB IN PASS PROTECTION TO GIVE ELI MANNING A CHANCE TO STEP UP
AND SEE THE THROW AND IF YOU GIVE ELI MANNING TIME, ODELL
BECKHAM, OUTSTANDING WORK, I WISH I COULD DANCE LIKE THAT.
&gt;&gt; Sean: THE DANCE MOVES AFTER THE TOUCHDOWN CATCH.
THE DOUBLE MOVES TO FREE HIM. GIOVANI BERNARD THE BALL CARRIER
AND THE BENGALS DON'T LOOK LIKE THEY'RE IN ANY BIG HURRY HERE
WITH A MINUTE TO GO IN THE FIRST HALF.
&gt;&gt; Jon: I'VE BEEN SURRISED BY THE VETERAN QUARTERBACK,
FIREPOWER EVERYWHERE. 3-4-1.
CUT IT LOOSE IN THE FIRST MINUTE.
&gt;&gt; Sean: A.J. GREEN CAUGHT SIX PASSES OF MORE 30 YARDS TO LEAD
THE LEAGUE. THERE'S A SLANT TO BRANDON
LaFELL FOR THE FIRST DOWN AND THEY'RE NOT MOVING WITH A LOT OF
URGENCY WITH 30 SECONDS TO GO IN THE HALF.
&gt;&gt; Jon: THESE ARE MEANINGLESS YARDS YOU MIGHT AS WELL FORGET
ABOUT IT NOW WITHIN 30 SECONDS. &gt;&gt; Sean: HE THROWS.
GREEN THE CATCH AND JON TO YOUR POINT THE BENGALS SAID THEY WISH
THEY WOULD HAVE MOVED MORE QUICKLY.
&gt;&gt; Jon: WHEN YOU HAVE A.J. GREEN, THE CLEVELAND GAME TWO
WEEKS AGO, HE MAKES A HAIL MARY CATCH THAT HE TIPPED TO HIMSELF.
YOU HAVE TO GIVE A HUMAN BEING LIKE A.J. GREEN AS MANY
OPPORTUNITIES AS YOU CAN. ANOTHER QUICK COMPLETION.
A TIME-OUT. AND A FIELD GOAL OR A HAIL MARY
TO A.J. GREEN, IT'S WORTH THE TRY.
&gt;&gt; Sean: THAT WAS A HAIL MARY AT THE END OF THE HALF AGAINST
CLEVELAND WHICH ANDY DALTON SAID WAS THE PLAY OF THE YEAR IN THE
NFL. EIFERT TACKLED IN THE OPEN
FIELD. BY CODY SENSABAUGH.
LAST TIME-OUT FOR THE BENGALS WITH THREE SECONDS TO GO AND THE
BALL AT THE 50 YARD LINE. AND IT'S THE TOYOTA HALFTIME
INCLUDING BOOMER'S FINAL DRIVE, INCLUDING RUSSELL WILSON,
OUTSTANDING IN NEW ENGLAND LAST NIGHT.
THE COWBOYS WITH THE BEST RECORD IN IN NFL AND INTERVIEW WITH
DEREK CARR AS THE RAIDERS GET READY FOR MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL
NEXT MONDAY NIGHT IN MEXICO CITY AGAINST THE HUSTON TEXANS.
PREVENT DEFENSE HERE FOR THE GIANTS.
LOOK WHO'S OUT THERE. ODELL BECKHAM JR.
&gt;&gt; Jon: I WANT TO SEE THIS HAIL MARY TO A.J. GREEN AND ODELL
BECKHAM PLAYING FREE SAFETY. THIS WILL BE INTERESTING.
&gt;&gt; Sean: FOUR-MAN RUSH. DALTON THROWS ON THE RUN.
IT WILL GET CLOSE TO THE GOAL LINE BUT GETS IT BATTED AWAY.
&gt;&gt; Jon: ODELL BECKHAM DOING IT ON BOTH ENDS.
PLAYING DEFENSIVE BACK. I'M SURPRISED HE DIDN'T CATCH
IT. &gt;&gt; Sean: YOU KNOW HE WANTED TO.
&gt;&gt; Jon: I KNOW HE DID. &gt;&gt; Sean: USING HIS HEAD ON
DEFENSE AS WELL. 14-10 THE GIANTS HAVE THE LEAD
AT THE BREAK. CINCINNATI WILL GET THE BALL TO
SECOND HALF.</description>

RAIDERS, DEREK CARR AND DEREK, YOU HAD A BYE WEEK, SO MAYBE YOU
WATCHED SOME FOOTBALL YESTERDAY THE CHIEFS AND THE BRONCOS,
ABOUT TO LOSE, ARE YOU ALREADY A SCOREBOARD WATCHER WITH WHERE
YOU'RE SITTING THIS YEAR. &gt;&gt; DEFINITELY TUNED INTO THOSE
GAMES. TALKING ABOUT A FINISH, MAN I BY
BOTH THOSE TEAMS. CAME BACK.
THAT'S A TESTAMENT TO THE DIVISION WE PLAY, I BELIEVE IT'S
THE TOUGHEST IN THE NFL. IT SHOWED DEFINITELY ON SUNDAY.
THEY CAME BACK AND BOTH HAD GOOD WINS.
LOT OF TEAMS AT TOP. &gt;&gt; WILD AND CRAZY FINISHES,
THAT'S BEEN YOUR M.O. I KNOW YOU'D LIKE TO WIN GAMES
BY 20 POINTS. WHAT IS IT WHEN IT GETS LATE OR
OVERTIME LIKE TAMPA OR LATE LIKE NEW ORLEANS AND WE CAN GO IT
SEEMS TO BRING OUT THE BEST IN YOU?
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT, I JUST HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO MY COACHING STAFF
AND TO MY TEAMMATES. LAST YEAR, COACH WAS TEACHING US
HOW TO COMPETE, AFTER THAT THIS YEAR HE SAID WE'RE GOING TO
LEARN TO WIN. WE HAD TO LEARN HOW TO WIN LATE
IN GAMES. AND YOU KNOW SO FAR IT CAME DOWN
TO THE WIRE, IT SEEMED LIKE ALL OF THEM.
WE PRACTICED THOSE SITUATIONS OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
&gt;&gt; THE NEXT TIME WE SEE THE OAKLAND RAIDERS YOU'LL BE
PLAYING IN MEXICO CITY ON MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL.
ARE YOU BRUSHING UP ON YOUR SPANISH, DEREK?
&gt;&gt; A LITTLE BIT. I'M SO EXCITED.
IT'S DREAM COME TRUE. EVERY KID, YOU HEAR IT EVERY
YEAR, MAN, YOU DREAM OF PLAYING ON MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL AND
THINGS LIKE THAT, AND IT'S AN EXCITING TIME.
SOMETHING I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO.
&gt;&gt; HOUSTON IS A FIRST-PLACE TEAM.
YOU'RE A FIRST-PLEASE TEAM. ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'RE A TEAM
WITH BULL'S-EYE ON YOUR BACK. YOU'LL GET THEIR BEST SHOT.
THAT'S GOING BE THAT WAY EVERY WEEK AND YOU HIT IT EXACTLY ON
THE HEAD. WE TURN THE FILM ON AND YOU
PREPARE AND YOU GET ALL THESE THINGS, SO FAR EVERY TEAM WE
HAVE PLAYED HAS DONE SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TRYING TO
SLOW OUR OFFENSIVE LINE DOWN. IT'S JUST FUN, MAN.
WE PREPARE OUR TAILS OFF, YOU PREPARE FOR THE UNEXPECTED.
SO, YOU KNOW, YOU EXPECT TO GET EVERYBODY'S BEST SHOT.
OUR COACHING STAFF HAS DONE A GREAT JOB OF PREPARING US.
I THINK OUR PLAYERS HAVE REALLY BROUGHT INTO THE PROCESS WE
HAVE. &gt;&gt; EVERYBODY'S LOOKING FORWARD
TO SEEING THE RAIDERS IN MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL IN MEXICO.
TRAVEL SAFELY. SEE YOU THERE, DEREK.

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; PLENTY OF FOOTBALL LEFT TO PLAY.
I'M MARK JONES ALONGSIDE ROD GILMORE.
QUINT KESSENICH ON THE FIELD. AIR RAID HAS BEEN SURPRISINGLY
EVEN HANDED IN ITS BALANCE. &gt;&gt; Rod: YEAH IT IS REALLY
SURPRISING WASHINGTON STATE'S BEEN SO GOOD WE REALLY DO NEED
THEM TO CONTINUE TO TO DO WHAT THEY HAVE DONE WHICH IS BALANCE
THINGS OUT. YOU SEE THE NUMBERS.
170, 124 AND FOR CAL THEY HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO GET A SPARK AND
STAY ON THE FIELD AND GET A SPARK OFF SPECIAL TEAMS FOR
DEFENSE TO GET A SCORE OR SHORT FIELD.
SOMETHING LIKE THAT. &gt;&gt; BROUGHT BY NORTHWESTERN
MUTUAL. &gt;&gt; Quint: WE'VE GOT FIND A WAY
TO GENERATE FOR PRESSURE ON THE QUARTERBACK.
THE WORDS OUT OF COACH DYKES. HE BASICALLY TRYING TO CONVINCE
ME THE SCORE COULD BE 21-21 IN THIS BALL GAME IF NOT FOR AN
INTERCEPTION IN THE END ZONE, SOME FAULTY SPECIAL TEAMS.
THEY HAVE MOVED THE BALL ON OFFENSE AND 290 YARDS SAYS THAT.
BUT ESPECIALLY THEY ARE RUNNING OUT OF PEOPLE.
RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE JACOB ANDERSON STARTING.
&gt;&gt; Mark: I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY ARE GOING TO GET PRESSURE WHEN
THEY CAN'T COVER IN THE SECONDARY.
&gt;&gt; Rod: THAT IS PART OF THE DILEMMA.
WASHINGTON STATE RUN HERE AND A FLAG DOWN.
NUMBER 23 GERARD WICKS. AND THE FIRST HALF HAD A LOT OF
THE PENALTIES AND TREND TILL CONTINUING.
14 PENALTIES IN THE FIRST HALF AND THAT IS THE FIRST ON THE
SECOND HALF ON THE FIRST PLAY OF THE BALL GAME.
&gt;&gt; Rod: I APPRECIATE THAT SONNY DYKES WANTS PRESSURE ON THE
QUARTERBACK AND YOU NEED THAT BUT GIVEN HIS SECONDARY HE CAN'T
BLITZ AND PLAY MAN COVERAGE BACK THERE.
THAT'S JUST ASKING FOR TROUBLE. &gt;&gt; Mark: TRYING TO PLUG HOLES IN
THE SECONDARY. COMPLETE OUT TO THE 33 YARD
LINE. C.J. DIMRY HAS THREE YARDS TO GO
FOR THE FIRST DOWN.</description>

      <description>PICKED UP 17.
&gt;&gt;&gt; SO IF YOU DON'T BLITZ THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS RIGHT THERE.
WHAT IS THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS? &gt;&gt; Rod: I HEAR YOU.
ROLL THE DICE. TAKE YOUR CHANCES.
JUST APPROXIMATE READY MORE THE BAND TO PLAY.
-- JUST BE READY FOR THEBAND TO PLAY.
&gt;&gt; Mark: AND MORROW. I'LL GIVE YOU CREDIT, LUKE FALK
WITH A BLOCK ON THAT PLAY WHICH LED TO THE FIRST DOWN.
ANDERSON FINALLY MAKING THE TACKLE.
FOR ME HE JUST KIND OF GOT IN THE WAY ROD GILMORE.
&gt;&gt; Rod: THAT'S GOOD BLOCK. ALL HE HAS DO IS GET IN THE WAY.
&gt;&gt; Mark: FIVE YARD GAIN. FIRST DOWN AND TEN.
THIS SATURDAY IN COLLEGE FOOTBALL, NUMBER THREE TWO,
THREE AND FOUR IN THE COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFFS LOSING TODAY.
FALK, INCOMPLETE INTEND FORWARD MARTIN.
OKAY. GRADE THIS BLOCK FOR ME ROD.
&gt;&gt; Rod: THERE IS YOUR QUARTERBACK, HEY HE GOT IN THE
WAY. THAT IS PROBABLY AN A MINUS.
&gt;&gt; Mark: WOW. &gt;&gt; Rod: BECAUSE HE'S IN THE WAY.
&gt;&gt; A MINUS? &gt;&gt; Rod: YEAH HE'S IN THE WAY.
DOESN'T HAVE TO KNOCK THE GUY DOWN.
HE JOUST GOT IN THE WAY. &gt;&gt; Mark: ALL RIGHT.
SECOND DOWN AND TEN. WILLIAMS IN THE BACK FIELD
BESIDE FALK. SURVEYS AND DELIVERS A STRIKE TO
A GUY WHO'S BEEN CONSPICUOUS BY HIS SILENCE TONIGHT.
GABE MARKS. &gt;&gt; Rod: AND THAT IS THE LACK OF
PRESSURE QUINT WAS TALKING ABOUT AND GABE MARKS TOOK ADVANTAGE OF
IT TO FINALLY COME UP WITH A CATCH.
WORRIED ABOUT HIM EARLIER AND TAKE THAT BIG HIT BUT LOOKS TO
BE FINE AFTER THAT CATCH. NO PRESSURE.
&gt;&gt; Mark: FIRST TEAM ALL PAC 12 A SEASON AGO FOR WASHINGTON STATE.
OFFSIDE FOR MARCH MARKS AGAIN. MARKS AFTER THE 2014 SEASON, THE
REAL TURNING POINT IN HIS CAREER HAD A STAPH INFECTION WHICH KEPT
HIM SIDE LINES FOR A COUPLE OFF MONTHS.
GOT WELL AND TOOK THE FOLLOWING YEAR OFF.
SAID IT GAVE HIM A CHANCE TO LEARN LOT ABOUT HIMSELF.
&gt;&gt; Rod: WE MIGHT LEARN SOMETHING ELSE ABOUT HIM WITH MATCH UP UP
TOP. &gt;&gt; Mark: THEY GO HIS WAY.
LOT OF CONTACT. HE WAS HELD UP BUT I'M NOT SURE
THAT WAS CATCHABLE. FRANKLIN DEFENDING ON THE PLAY.
&gt;&gt; Rod: AND FALK SAY THAT MATCH UP AND WANTED TO GO THERE BUT
FRANKLIN DID A NICE JOB DISRUPTING THE ROUTE THAT MARKS
WANTS TO RUN. &gt;&gt; Mark: THIRD DOWN AND ONE.
TO THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SCREEN NOW.
OUT OF THE BACK FIELD THIS IS WILLIAMS ON THE MOVE.
AND INSIDE THE 20 AT THE 18. ANOTHER COUGAR FIRST DOWN.
&gt;&gt; Rod: HE JUST GETTOUS OUTSIDE OF CONTAIN VERY QUICKLY.
COULDN'T KEEP HIM INSIDE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN WILLIAMS IS OFF TO
THE RACES. &gt;&gt; Mark: A 22 YARD GAIN AND A
FIRST DOWN. RUN IT INTO THE BOUNDARY.
THAT IS WILLIAMS AGAIN, QUINT -- &gt;&gt; Rod: YEAH THE MOTION AND
SHIFTING FROM MIKE LEACH IN THIS AIR RAID OFFENSE IS SOMETHING WE
DID NOT SEE OUT OF THIS GROUP IN WEEK TWO AGAINST BOISE.
WE SAW A LITTLE AGAINST STANFORD AND NOW WE'RE EVEN SEEING A
HEAVIER DOCE LATE IN THE SEASON. USING PRE SNAP DECEPTION, MOVING
HIS GUY, CAUSING CHAOS. &gt;&gt; Mark: AND MORE CHAOS FOR THE
BEARS. A PLAYER DOWN AT THE 17
YARDLINE. ANOTHER INJURED PLAYER FOR THE
BEARS. DOWN AT THE 17.
WE'LL TAKE TIMEOUT AND GET SOME INFORMATION ON THE OVER SIDE.</description>

      <description>&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; NFL INSIDERS SUNDAY EDITION WITH THE EARLY BREAKING STORIES
OF NEWS AND THEN AT 11:00 SUNDAY NFL COUNTDOWN.
RIGHT UP TO KICKOFF. LIVE ON THE ESPN APP AND WATCH
ESPN. NUMBER 15, LUKE FALK.
74% OF HIS PASSES. AND HASN'T LET UP TONIGHT.
INCOMPLETE. SETUPS THIRD DOWN AND FIVE.
&gt;&gt; Rod: IMPORTANT FOR CAL TO TRY AND GET A STOP HERE.
HOLD THEM TO A FATIGUE. GET WEBB BACK OUT AND TRY AND
GET SOME MOMENTUM TO GIVE UP A TOUCHDOWN RIGHT NOW AFTER THE
WAY THEY ENDED THE FIRST HALF. NOT BEING ABLE TO CONVERT ON THE
DRIVES JUST REALLY DEMORALIZED THE BEARS.
&gt;&gt; Mark: COMPLETE FOR THE FIRST DOWN THE TAVERAS MARTIN JR.
FIRST AND GHOUL AND THE BEAT GOES ON FOR THE COUGARS.
&gt;&gt; Rod: LAST TIME THEY WERE DOWN HERE THEY WERE NOT AFRAID TO RUN
THE BALL. THE OFFENSIVE LINE HAS DONE A
GOOD JOB. &gt;&gt; Mark: FALK, INCOMPLETE WISELY
THROWING THAT AWAY UNDER DURESS. SECOND DOWN AND GOAL.
IF YOU ARE JUST JOINING US, REMEMBER WASHINGTON LOSING
EARLIER TONIGHT AT HOME AGAINST USC.
SO RIGHT NOW THE COUGARS HALF GAME UP, FIRST PLACE IN THE PAC
12 NORTH. &gt;&gt; Rod: WASHINGTON STATE WIN
TONIGHT WOULD MEAN WASHINGTON STATE WILL PLAY FOR THE NORTH
DIVISION TITLE IN THE APPLE CUP IN TWO WEEKS.
THAT IS WHAT'S AT STAKE IF THEY BEAT CAL TONIGHT.
&gt;&gt; THEY WILL GET WASHINGTON AT HOME HERE.
SECOND AND GOAL. FALK END ZONE.
TOUCHDOWN. HE GOT THE TOUCHDOWN.
HIS HIS THIRD OF THE NIGHT. &gt;&gt; Rod: WATCH HIP DANCE.
CATCH, LEFT TOE. LEFT FOOT.
ALL HE NEEDS. AND HE CONTROLS THE FOOTBALL.
SHOWS IT TO THE REFs. WELL DONE.
&gt;&gt; Mark: FOR CRACRAFT A CAREER HIGH WITH HIS THIRD TOUCHDOWN OF
THE NIGHT. I.
&gt;&gt; Mark: LOOKING OUT OVER THE FIELD HERE AT MARTIN STADIUM.
MIKE LEACH'S OFFENSE LITTERED WITH TROPHIES AND MEMORABILIA
FROM SOME OF HIS FAVORITE COACHING MENTORS AND IDOLS AND
OF COURSE THE AFFINITY FOR THE PIRATE CULTURE HE HAS, ROD.
&gt;&gt; Rod: AND REALLY BAD --. AHOY MATETY.
HOW DID HE STUMBLE ON PIRATES OF ALL THINGS THERE.
&gt;&gt; Mark: COMPLETE, GOT HIT IMMEDIATELY.
GAIN OF ABOUT SEVEN ON THE PLAY. MIKE LEACH A VERY AVID FISHER AS
WELL AND A NUMBER OF CAL PLAYERS SHAKEN UP ON THE PLAY.
COMPLETE TO DEMETRIUS ROBERTSON. GAIN OF FIVE AND A LOOK AT THE
HIT ON MAR KEYS. &gt;&gt; Rod: HE'S THE 5'9" FRESHMAN
WHO TOOK A SHOT THERE. &gt;&gt; Mark: PASS COMPLETE TO THE
SHORTSIDE OF THE FIELD. RIVERA.
&gt;&gt; Rod: WE TALKED ABOUT WHAT CAL NEEDED IN THIS SECOND HALF AS
YOU SEE STOVALL. &gt;&gt; Mark: MARCELLUS PITMAN
LIMITING HIM TO A SIX YARD GAIN. &gt;&gt; Rod: AND CAL HASN'T GOTTEN A
PLAY DEFENSIVELY IN THIRD QUARTER AND NOTHING ON SPECIAL
TEAMS BUT THEY NEED TO GET PLAYS ON THIS OBVIOUSLY OFFENSIVELY TO
GET BACK IN THIS. &gt;&gt; Mark: FIRST DOWN AT THE 46
YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; Rod: RAN A STUNT INSIDE AND
HE CAME FREE RIGHT UP THE MIDDLE.
DERIDER. &gt;&gt; Rod: HE HE COMES RIGHT
THROUGH THE GAP AND IT IS NOT CLEAR WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM BUT
HE WENT DOWN RIGHT AFTER TAKING WEBB DOWN.
&gt;&gt; Mark: LOOKED RATHER ROUTINE. &gt;&gt; Rod: A PICK IN THE END ZONE
AND NOW A SACK. PRETTY GOOD NIGHT ALREADY.
&gt;&gt; Mark: UNDER 10:00 TO GO HERE IN THE THIRD QUARTER.
BEARS NEEDING A SCORE BADLY. 0 AND 4 ON THE ROAD THIS YEAR.
&gt;&gt; Rod: THEY HAVE NOT BEGUN GOOD ON THIRD DOWN TONIGHT.
THEY HAVE GOT TO CONVERT. THEY ARE 2 OF 8 TONIGHT.
&gt;&gt; Mark: McMORRIS IN MOTION. WEBB DELIVERS LATE OUT OF BOUNDS
AND NOT EVERYONE CLOSE AND FOURTH DOWN COMING UP FOR CAL.
THE MOST INTERESTING THING ABOUT THAT PLAY WAS SEEING 310 POUND
MALIK MORRIS GO IN MOTION. I'VE SEEN IT ALL NOW.
&gt;&gt; Rod: HE'S LIGHT ON HIS FEET. YOU CAN SEE WHAT YOU WANT ABOUT
310 AND BEING 5'11" BUT HE'S LIGHT ON HIS FEET.
HE CAN RUN WITH THE BALL. &gt;&gt; Mark: WHAT A NIGHT FOR
WASHINGTON STATE COUGARS SO FAR. &gt;&gt; Mark: THEN DONE IT ALL
JONESY. YOU TALKED ABOUT BEING A
COMPLETE TEAM TONIGHT. OPENED UP ON SPECIAL TEAMS WITH
A KICK RETURN. PUNT RETURN TO START THE GAME
AND OFFENSIVELY THE GROUND ATTACK GOT GOING AND THEY PUT IT
IN THE AIR AND CRACRAFT HAS HAD A HUGE IGHT WITH A COUPLE OF
GRABS AND DEFENSE HAD A RED ZONE PICK BY DERIDERS.
THEY HAVE DONE IT IN EVERY PHASE OF THE GAME TO JUMP OUT TO THIS
35-7 LEAD AND LOOK VERY MUCH LIKE THE KING OF THE NORTH WITH
THEIR HALF GAME LEAD OVER THE WASHINGTON HUSKY RIGHT NOW.
&gt;&gt; Mark: WILLIAMS WITH THE BACK FIELD HANDOFF.
PLOWS HIS WAY DOWN TO THE 17 YARD LINE.
QUINT? &gt;&gt; Quint: I DON'T THINK THIS
OFFENSIVE LINE IS GETTING ENOUGH CREDIT.
ESPECIALLY THE LEFT GUARD CODY O'CONNELL.
6'8", 350, RATED THE NUMBER TWO GUARD IN THE COUNTRY AND YOU SEE
THE BALANCE NOW THEY HAVE BROUGHT TO THIS TEAM.
MIKE LEACH ABLE TO RUN THE BALL EFFECTIVELY ESPECIALLY IN THE
RUN ZONE. THEY ARE EXCELLENT AT THIRD AND
LESS THAN TWO OR FOURTH AND LESS THAN TWO YARDS SO THEY ARE
SHOWING SOME POWER UP FRONT AS WELL.
&gt;&gt; Mark: I THINK THAT IS RIGHT. I THIS I THAT IS WHY THEY ARE
GETTING HIGH GRADES. THEY ARE SHOWING WHAT THEY HAVE
BEEN DOING RUSHING THE BALL WHICH HAS SHOWN WHAT'S BEEN THE
CASE THE LAST FEW YEARS. &gt;&gt; Mark: FIRST DOWN AND TEN FOR
WASHINGTON STATE. AND FALK IS GOING RUN OUT OF
BOUNDS AND TIPTOE OUT AT THE 15. &gt;&gt; Rod: I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT
WASHINGTON STATE SHOULD THEY WIN WILL PLAY WASHINGTON FOR THE
NORTH. NEXT WEEK THEY HAVE COLORADO.
BUT GIVEN THEIR LEAD IN THE DIVISION AND THE STAKES FOR THAT
GAME IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT HAPPENS WITH COLORADO NEXT WEEK.
THEY WILL STILL PLAY WASHINGTON FOR THE DIVISION AND THE APPLE
CUT. &gt;&gt; Mark: HEAD TO HEAD DEAL.
SECOND AND SIX. MORROW ON THE CARRY.
STOPPED UP OF THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE.
NO GAIN ON THE PLAY. &gt;&gt; Rod: AND NOW ALL THOUGHTS ON
THE PAC 12 WILL TURN TO EARLY NEXT WEEK.
HOW DOES THE COMMITTEE TREAT WASHINGTON UNTIL HOW DOES THE
COMMITTEE TREAT WASHINGTON STATE?
THEY MOVE THEM UP IF THEY SHOULD WIN TONIGHT FROM THEIR 23rd SPOT
BUT CLEARLY NOT ENOUGH TO GET THEM IN CONTENTION TO BE A
PLAYOFF CONTENDER WITH THE TWO LOSSES THEY SUFFERED AT THE
BEGINNING OF THE SOMEBODY. &gt;&gt; Mark: EASTERN WASHINGTON AND
BOISE STATE. THIRD AND FIVE FOR WASHINGTON
STATE. FALK GOING THROUGH HIS
PROGRESSION. HAD ALL NIGHT TO THROW IT.
AND FINDS CRACRAFT UNDERNEATH. AND CRACRAFT IS SHAKEN UP ON THE
FIVE YARD GAIN. SO THAT IS THE LAST THING THAT
THE COUGARS NEED. HE'S HAD A TREMENDOUS NIGHT.
HE'S CRITICAL TO THIS OFFENSE. GETS TACKLED FROM BEHIND.
THAT IS A SEEMINGLY KIND OF HARMLESS AS FAR AS TACKLES GO.
THREE TOUCHDOWNS CATCHES IN HIS LAST --
&gt;&gt; EASY FOR YOU TO SAY. &gt;&gt; MarOR 87
YARDS. THE THREE TOUCHDOWNS AND THIS IS
AN OFFENSE THAT REALLY SPREADS THE RESENSATIONS AROUND WHEN YOU
LOOK AT GABE MARKS WITH 61. CRACRAFT WITH 34 COMING INTO THE
BALL GAME. GOOD TO SEE HIM GET UP THERE AND
BRING THAT LEFT LEG. MART WITHIN 50 PASSES.
&gt;&gt; Rod: NOT GOOD TO SEE HIM LIMPING OFF.
A TREMENDOUS PLAYER. HIS LEFT LEG.
THEY WERE CHECKING HIS LEFT KNEE AND HE IS SO CRITICAL TO THIS
OFFENSE AND REMEMBER THERE IS A LOT LEFT
IN FRONT OF WASHINGTON STATE ASSUMING THEY WIN TONIGHT.
THEY WOULD NEED HIM. THEY CAN ILL AFFORD TO LOSE
CRACRAFT. &gt;&gt; Mark: FAVORING THAT LEFT LEG.
AND TALKED ABOUT HIS IMPORTANCE. THE GOOD NEWS IS IF YOU ARE
LOOKING FOR A LITTLE SILVER LINING AT THIS POINT, WE DON'T
WANT TO JUMP TO ANY CONCLUSIONS THE OFFENSE IS AMONGST ANY
RECEIVERS THE PASSES ARE PRETTY EVENLY DISTRIBUTED.
IT IS NOT A ONE MAN SHOW BY ANY STRETCH.
&gt;&gt; Rod: WE TALKED ABOUT FALK AND HOW HE'S GROWN IN PATIENCE AND
MATURITY. AND HOW HE SPREADS THE BALL
AROUND. THE CRACRAFT IS DYNAMIC.
&gt;&gt; Mark: RARE PUNT TONIGHT. ZACH SHARMY.
OUT OF BOUNDS.                âª                âª</description>

      <description>WHICH THOSE WASHINGTON STATE
RECEIVERS DO SO WELL ON THOSE MESH ROUTES.
THAT WE LOOKED AT IN FILM. &gt;&gt; Rod: IF YOU DON'T BRING SOME
PRESSURE OR SOMETHING FALK IS JUST GOING TO KEEP CHIPPING
AWAY. &gt;&gt; Mark: FIRST DOWN AND 10 FROM
THE 12. CRAZY DAY, CRAZY SATURDAY IN
COLLEGE FOOTBALL. INVOLVING THE TOP FOUR TEAMS.
THIS IS COMPLETE TOMORROW. TRYING TO PICK UP A COUPLE
BLOCKS BUT A GOOD TACKLE AS HE TRIES TO TOUCH BACK.
WASHINGTON LOSING EARLIER AT HOME AGAINST USC.
CLEMSON LOSING EARLIER AT HOME AGAINST PITT.
SECOND DOWN AND 15 ON THAT LOSS OF FIVE.
LUKE FALK A FORMER WALK ON. A FLAG DOWN ON THE PLAY.
&gt;&gt; FALSE START OFFENSE NUMBER 60.
FIVE YARD PENALTY. SECOND DOWN.
&gt;&gt; TALKED ABOUT THE TUMULTUOUS STANDARD IT'S BEEN.
CLEMSON USE LOSING. MICHIGAN JUST LOST TO IOWA.
SECONDS AGO. TWO THREE FOUR, EIGHT NINE
FOURTEEN. THERE IS ALWAYS ONE DAY LIKE
THIS. BLACK SATURDAY, WOW.
#COMMITTEE, I HOPE YOU ARE WATCHING.
SECOND AND 20, ANOTHER FLAG DOWN.
FALK. CAUGHT.
CRACRAFT WITH A CIRCUS GRAB. TOUCHDOWN OFFSIDE, DEFENSE
NUMBER NINE. THAT PENALTY IS DECLINED.
RESULT OF THE PLAY IS A TOUCHDOWN.
&gt;&gt; Mark: AND FOR CRACRAFT HIS THIRD TOUCHDOWN CATCH OF THE
YEAR. &gt;&gt; Rod: WATCH HIM GO OCCUPY
JONESY. THIS IS FANTASTIC.
LOOKS LIKE INITIALLY THIS WAS OVERTHROWN BUT WATCH HIM GET UP.
WOW. &gt;&gt; Mark: THAT IS THAT PLAY IN
OVER JACOB ANDERSON. HIS 18th CAREER TOUCHDOWN GRAB.
AND WASHINGTON STATE'S OFFENSE CONTINUES TO ROLL.
ONE OF THE MOST PROLIFIC OFFENSES IN THE COUNTRY WITH HIS
QUARTERBACK THAT IS --. DISEMBOWELLING THAT DEFENSE OF
CAL.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; LOOK AT SOME OF THE BRAVE
MEN AND WOMEN IN AROUND THE WORLD SPORTING THEIR SCHOOL
COLORS. THIS WEEK WE HONOR AMERICA'S
HEROS ARE SERVING IN OUR NATION'S ARMED FORCES AND
SPECIAL SHOUT OUT TO MY LATE COUSIN CARL JONES WHO SERVED OUR
COUNTRY BRAVELY. GREAT CATCH BY RIVER CRACRAFT.
&gt;&gt; Rod: CRITICAL SERIES COMING UP FOR THE BEARS.
TRYING TO STAY WITHIN CONTACT OF  CAN THEY BE THE --
[INDISCERNIBLE] &gt;&gt; Mark: MUHAMMAD OUT TO THE 18
YARD LINE. ED AMAN WHAT A DAY.
STAY AWAKE BUDDY. &gt;&gt; IT'S BEEN UNBELIEVABLE.
MICHIGAN AND IOWA. [INDISCERNIBLE]
FOUR OF THE TOP TEN TEAMS -- AND JIM HARBAUGH WAS QUARTERBACK
WITH MICHIGAN'S TEAM WAY BACK THEN.
HEAD COACH, NUMBER THREE IN THE COUNTRY.
WOW. &gt;&gt; Mark: GOING TO BE VERY
INTERESTING INSIDE THAT COMMITTEE ROOM.
WEBB TO PASS. FINDS HIS RECEIVER HANSEN OUT TO
THE 45 YARD LINE. BROUGHT DOWN BY ROBERT TAYLOR.
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS WEEK'S COLLEGE FOOTBALL RANKINGS BY
CAPITAL ONE. 2, 3 AND 4 LOSE TODAY.
&gt;&gt; ALABAMA, LET'S JUST TAKE THEM OU
&gt;&gt; Mark: TREY WATSON. &gt;&gt; Rod: YOU KNOW JONESY, SINCE
THERE WERE SO MANY LOSSES TODAY THERE WAS REALLY NO IMPACT.
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS TEAMS NOW HAVE A ONE NEXT TO THE L. COLUMN
THAT HAD ZEROS. OTHER THAN ALABAMA EVERYBODY IS
IN THE SAME BOAT. &gt;&gt; Mark: I WONDER WHAT IT MEANS
FROM A CONFERENCE PERSPECTIVE WHEN YOU START LOOKING AT THOSE
AND EVALUATING ALL OF THOSE ONE-LOSS TEAMS.
THE CATCH, NICE RUN AFTER THE CATCH FOR THE FIRST DOWN.
LET'S GO DOWN TO QUINT. &gt;&gt; Quint: ROD, I AGREE TO A
CERTAIN DEGREE. TEAMS LIKE MICHIGAN CAN STILL
GET INTO THEIR CONFERENCE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME.
BUT A TEAM LIKE AUBURN, THEIR DREAMS DID END TODAY AS ALABAMA
CLINCHES THAT DIVISION. SO THE FIELD IS SHORTENED.
&gt;&gt; Mark: YEP. WEBB THROWING IT UP FOR GRABS.
A FLAG INCOMPLETE. &gt;&gt; Referee: PASS INTERFERENCE
DEFENSE NUMBER 27, 15 YARD PENALTY.
AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; Rod: HE'S NOT EVEN LOOKING
FOR THE BALL. GRAB,ING U CLEARLY IMPEDING.
AND RIGHT, QUINT, TEAMS YOU CAN TAKE OUT NOW.
YOU HAVE SO MANY ONE-LOSS TEAMS CLUMPED TOGETHER.
&gt;&gt; Mark: WATSON, BROUGHT DOWN JUST INSIDE THE 20 BY LUANI.
A BIG HIT THERE AND AN EIGHT YARD GAIN ON THE PLAY.
LUANI'S A BIG PLAY MAKERER IN THE SECONDARY.
PLAY MAKER SECOND DOWN AND TWO HANSEN.
PICKED UP THE FIRST DOWN JUST INSIDE THE 15 YARD LINE.
GOOD TO SEE HANSEN BACK MOVING A LITTLE BETTER THIS WEEK.
&gt;&gt; Rod: YEAH AND HE'S GETTING THE BALL QUICKLY.
WEBB IS GETTING IT OUT QUICKLY. WORKED REALLY WELL.
NOT ANY PRESSURE ON WEBB. HE REALLY HASN'T BEEN HIT VERY
MUCH. &gt;&gt; Mark: HANSEN AT THE BOTTOM OF
THE SCREEN. WORKING AGAINST MOLTON.
HANSEN PICKED UP ABOUT TWO ON THE PLAY.
MOLTON MAKES THE TACKLE. HENSON STARTED AT --.
TRANSFERRED PUT OUT AN E-MAIL BLAST OF HIS HOMEMADE VIDEOS TO
A BUNCH OF MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE AND PAC 12 SCHOOLS
AND CAL THE ONLY SCHOOL REALLY TO SHOW INTEREST.
&gt;&gt; YEAH. AS A WALK ON.
NOT LIKE THEY OFFERED LIMB HIM A SCHOLARSHIP.
&gt;&gt; Mark: SECOND AND SEVEN. COMPLETE TO SINGLETON AND
SINGLETON ABOUT FOUR YARDS SHOFRT THE FIRST.
&gt;&gt; Rod: WEBB IS GETTING THAT BALL OUT LIKE A MIDDLE
INFIELDER. WASHINGTON STATE HAS NOT BEEN
ABLE TO GET ANY PRESSURE ON HIM AT ALL.
&gt;&gt; COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THESE TWO TEAMS COMBINED FOR 60-59 FINAL.
19 POINTS ON THE BOARD TWO YEARS AGO.
BLITZ COMING. HE GOT RID OF IT BUT IT'S BROKEN
UP. INCOMPLETE.
PASS BROKEN UP INTENDED FOR VEASY.
HE'S EVERYWHERE AND THERE IS A FLAG DOWN ON THE PLAY AS WELL.
GOT TO BE THE MOST FLAGS WE'VE SEEN IN A SINGLE GAME HIS YEAR.
&gt;&gt; Rod: TYPICALLY GET POINTS AND A LOT OF LAUNDRY ON THE FIELD.
&gt;&gt; Mark: 11 PENALTIES. &gt;&gt; Referee: PERSONAL FOUL, FACE
MASK OFFENSE NUMBER 64. 13 YARD PENALTY.
FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; Mark: DON'T SEE THAT ONE
CALLED A LOT. STEPHEN MOORE RIGHT THERE.
21-7. DAVIS WEBB THE LEADER OF THIS
TEAM. HE WAS VOTED CAPTAIN AFTER THREE
WEEKS JOINING THE PROGRAM. BIG PLAY ON THIRD AND 19.
PLAY CLOCK AT FIVE. THEY LOOK A LITTLE DISJOINTED.
THEY GET THE SNAP IN TIME. BOY, THERE WAS CONFUSION ALL
AROUND AND VEASY LOOKED AT THE PASS AS IF IT WASN'T INTENDED
FOR HIM. &gt;&gt; Rod: BUT WE TALKED ABOUT THE
LACK OF PRESSURE AND THEY FINALLY DECIDED TO BRING SOME
AND SPEED THAT UP. SNAF BIG HIT, GOOD PRESSURE BY
FRANKIE LUVU. WEBB SHAKING HIS HEAD AND NOW IN
COMES MACK ANDERSON TO ATTEMPT THE FIELD GOAL FROM 41 YARDS
OUT. 16 OF 18 ON THE SEASON BUT HE
PUSHED THAT ONE TO THE RIGHT. LIEU</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt; M
&gt;&gt; Mark: MARTIN STADIUM, HOME TEAM LEADING 21-7 AFTER THAT
MISSED FIELD GOAL. AND UNLESS YOU STAY UP LATE ON
THE EAST COAST, AND EVEN THE CENTRAL TIME ZONES YOU DON'T
KNOW THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE HOTTEST TEAMS IN THE COUNTRY
RIGHT NOW. WILLIAMS WITH A NICE RUN.
DETERMINED RUN. STILL ALIVE.
AND NOW FINALLY THE WHISTLE BLOWING, PICKED UP ABOUT 14.
&gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT THE PENALTY ON THE LAST ONE?
&gt;&gt; IF YOU ARE A CAL FAN THIS IS WHAT COST YOU POINTS.
LOOK OVER A THERE YOU WILL SEE THE PENALTY RIGHT THERE.
GRAB THE FACE MASK. THAT RESULTED IN 15 YARDS AND A
MISSED FIELD GOAL. NO POINTS FOR CAL.
&gt;&gt; Mark: GREAT CALL BY THE OFFICIALS.
FALK SLIDING IN. NOT A SMOOTH ONE.
PICKS UP TWO YARDS. AND HE -- HE MIGHT HAVE JAMMED
HIS KNEE A LITTLE ON THAT SLIDE. &gt;&gt; Rod: IT IS REALLY NOT THAT
HARD. BUT HE'S HURTING.
OH MAN. &gt;&gt; Mark: LOOKS LIKE HE EH GOT
STUFFED. &gt;&gt; Rod: VERY AWKWARD.
HE JUST STOPPED. HE'S WEARING A BRACE ON THAT
LEFT KNEE AND IT LOOKED LIKE IT MIGHT HAVE GOT CAUGHT IN THAT
TURF. LUKE FALK HOT MESS RIGHT NOW IN
THE FIELD. &gt;&gt; Rod: THEY WILL BRING THE
BASEBALL COACH OVER. YOU KNOW, DO SOME PRACTICE.
DON'T SLIDE ON THAT KNEE. GET ON THAT HIP A LITTLE GET.
YOU WILL BE FINE. &gt;&gt; Mark: YOU ARE NO BASEBALL
GUY. I LOVE HEARING YOUR BASEBALL
ANALOGIES. -- COMING IN.
-- AGAINST ARIZONA IN THE FOURTH QUARTER MOSTLY.
&gt;&gt; Rod: CAN'T USE YOUR KNEE AS A BRAKE WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO
SLIDE. &gt;&gt; Mrk: GOOD THING YOU DIDN'T
TRY TO HOOK SLIDE. &gt;&gt; Rod: OH SOME KNOWLEDGE THERE.
&gt;&gt; Mark: SECOND AND EIGHT. THE PLAY AND THE ROLL ON THE
PASS ATTEMPT TO JAMAL MORROW. AND LUKE FALK COMES BACK IN THE
BALL GAME NOW. AND LET'S GO BACK TO RESETTING
WASHINGTON STASMT THEY LOST THE FIRST TWO GAMES OF THE SEASON.
ONE OF THEM TO EASTERN WASHINGTON AND MIKE LEACH, THE
HEAD COACH THAT A LOT OF GUYS ON THE TEAM MAINTAINED THEIR GREAT
WORK ETHIC. SOME GUY WERE MAKING ADJUSTMENTS
TO NEW POSITIONS AND TRYING TO DO A LITTLE TOO MUCH.
&gt;&gt; Rod: HE CALLED THEM SOFT. SAID THE TEAM WAS SOFT.
USED THAT WORD. &gt;&gt; Mark: THIRD AND EIGHT.
WHAT A TURNAROUND. THEY BURN OFF SEVEN CONSECUTIVE
WINS. RIGHT NOW AS OF THIS MOMENT IN
FIRST IN THE PAC 12 NORTH. THAT PASS INCOMPLETE.
ALMOST PICKED OFF ON THE TIP, INTENDED FOR MARTIN VANDERBILT.
ALMOST HAD HIMSELF AN INTERCEPTION.
AND FOURTH DOWN COMING UP BUT FALK ONE OF THOSE LEADING VOICES
INSIDE THE LOCKER ROOM THAT LEACH REFERRED TO.
HIM AND WILLIAMS. MARTIN.
JOHNSON, A COUPLE OF GUYS, YOU KNOW, PARKER HENRY.
A GOOD VOICE AS WELL. AND THIS TEAM HAS REALLY
REBOUNDED. &gt;&gt; Rod: THIS TEAM IS IN POSITION
TO WIN THE PAC 12 AND GET TO A ROSE BOWL.
FIRST PUNT OF THE NIGHT --. RIVERA ON THE RETURN AND ANOTHER
FLAG DOWN. BACK AT THE 26 YARD LINE.
AND THAT APPLE CUP GAME COMING IN A FEW WEEKS IS GOING TO BE
PRETTY CHARGED. WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WITH THAT
0-2 START THAT YOU MENTIONED. WE WAIT FOR CALL HERE.
THAT THEY WOULD BE IN POSITION TO FIGHT FOR THE DIVISION AND
POSSIBLY, FIRST ROSE BOWL SINCE 2002.
&gt;&gt; Mark: OFFICIALS STILL SORTING THIS OUT ON THE PUNT RETURN.
&gt;&gt; Referee: DURING THE KICK, HOLDING RECEIVING TEAM.
TEN YARDS FROM WHERE THE KICK WAS CAUGHT.
FIRST DOWN CALIFORNIA. &gt;&gt; Mark: SO WEBB WILL TAKE OVER
ON OFFENSE AFTER THE PENALTY. WE'LL FIND OUT HOW THAT GOES ON
THE OTHER SIDE THIS. STICK AROUND.       designed for Zales,
       THE DIAMOND STORE.              âª âª âª     WHEN YOU FIND SOMETHING

&gt;&gt; Mark: WELL THE NEXT COLLEGE FOOTBALL TOP 25 RANKINGS SHOW IS
IN TUESDAY NIGHT IN NEW YORK. ALSO AVAILABLE STREAMING LIVE ON
THE ESPN APP AND WATCH ESPN. MUHAMMAD IN THE BACK FIELD.
DAVIS WEBB WITH 6:19 TO GO HERE. AND A LOW SCORING FIRST HALF FOR
THESE TWO TEAMS. INTO A TIGHT WINDOW.
HANSEN THERE AT THE OTHER END OF IT.
AND A NICE CATCH MADE AT THE 33 YARD LINE.
WOW. 21 YARDS ON THE GAIN.
&gt;&gt; Rod: YEAH HE CAUGHT IT. GOT DOWN LOW.
GOT THE HANDS AROUND IT. HE'S GOOD.
&gt;&gt; Mark: TALKED ABOUT HIM A MOMENT AGO.
A TRANSFER FOR IDAHO STATE. &gt;&gt; Referee: -- COMPLETES PASS IS
UNDER REVIEW. &gt;&gt; Rod: THAT LOOKED GOOD TO ME.
YEAH. JUST OUR INITIAL REPLAY THERE
LOOKED LIKE HANSEN GOT BOTH HANDS UNDERNEATH THAT.
LOOK FOR HIS HANDS. HANDS BETWEEN THE BALL AND THE
GROUND. &gt;&gt; Rod: WHILE WE WAIT FOR
OFFICIAL US TO CONFIRM KWHA THINK IS A CATCH, THIS DAY,
CRAZY. THERE ARE GOING TO BE SOME FANS
OUT THERE WHO HAVEN'T REALLY KIND OF PIECED THIS TOGETHER.
BUT AS THEY START LOOKING AT IT, I'M TALKING TO YOU OHIO STATE
FANS. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE HAPPY
WITH WHAT THINGS LOOK LIKE WHEN YOU START LOOKING AT RACES IN
THE BIG TEN AND OTHER PLACES. &gt;&gt; THEY ARE IN A PRETTY TENUOUS
POSITION RIGHTS NOW. &gt;&gt; Rod: IT IS LOOKING LIKE
MICHIGAN IS STILL IN CONTROL AND THEN LIKELY PENN STATE, SURPRISE
SURPRISE. OHIO STATE IS GOING TO NEED SOME
HELP. &gt;&gt; Mark: WE'LL SEE WHAT ALL
HAPPENS. WHAT A CALAMITOUS DAY FOR THREE
OF THE TEAMS IN THE TOP FOUR IN FACT THE COLLEGE FOOTBALL
PLAYOFFS. MUHAMMAD STRAIGHT AHEAD.
STHORT OF THE 40 YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; Rod: JUST FOR THE MOMENT
CONSIDER WASHINGTON STATE. AND I THINK I KNOW THE ANSWER TO
THIS. EVEN IF THEY WENT OUT THE
COMMITTEE IS GOING HOLD THE FIRST TWO LOSSES AGAINST THEM.
&gt;&gt; Mark: MUHAMMAD OVER THE 43 YARD LINE.
TALKING ABOUT BOISESTATE AND EASTERN WASHINGTON.
&gt;&gt; THE EASTERN WASHINGTON IN PARTICULAR.
EVEN IN THEY WIN OUT AND OTHER TEAMS LOSE AND YOU SAY YOU HAVE
A PAC 12 CHAMP EVEN IF IT IS WASHINGTON STATE.
THAT IS WHY THE PAC 12 IS IN TROUBLE.
WITH WASHINGTON HAVING LOST TONIGHT.
&gt;&gt; Mark: FIRST DOWN AND 10, WEBB.
TAKING A SHOT DOWN FIELD. ON THE MOVE AGAIN.
GOT IN ROUND HIM FOR THE CATCH. &gt;&gt; Rod: BUT WATCH THE LEFT HAND
OF HANSEN. HE MIGHT HAVE GOT AWAY WITH A
LITTLE BIT OF A PUSHOFF HERE. LOOK AT THE LEFT HAND AND HE
PUSHES BACK SO THAT THE DEFENDER CAN'T JUMP.
&gt;&gt; HOLD ON. YOU USUALLY CALL THAT INCIDENTAL
CONTACT, DON'T YOU? &gt;&gt; Rod: NO HE IMPEDED THE
DEFENDER FROM MAKING A PLAY I'M TELLING YOU.
&gt;&gt; Mark: NICE BLOCK ON THE DEFENDER SCREEN.
DOWN TO THE SIX YARD LINE. VEASY WITH A BLOCK.
SO THAT WASN'T -- &gt;&gt; IN MY VIEW IT WAS.
NOW THE OFFICIALS LOOKED AT IT AND HEY, 50/50 BALL, JOCKEYING
FOR POSITION. GO GET IT BUT I SAW A CLEAR LEFT
HAND PUSH OFF TO HELP HIM OUT. IT HAPPENS.
&gt;&gt; Mark: MUHAMMAD. STOUT DEFENSE UP FRONT BY
GARRETT McGROOM. THIRD DOWN COMING UP.
&gt;&gt; Rod: THEY ARE STAYING WITHIN CONTACT OF WASHINGTON STATE.
&gt;&gt; Mark: THIRD AND THREE. CONNECTED ON 13 OF HIS LAST 15
PASSES. INTO THE END ZONE.
PICKED OFF. PICKED OFF IN THE END ZONE AND
RAN IT OUT. &gt;&gt; Rod: WEBB LOOK AT THE
RECEIVER BUT DIDN'T SURVEY THE COVERAGE.
HE HAD LINEBACKERS FLOWING. JUST TAKE LOOK RIGHT THERE.
LOOK AT THAT. HE'S GOT LINEBACKERS FLOWING
RIGHT INTO THE SLANT WHERE HE WAS LOOKING BUT HE NEVER LOOKED
FOR WHERE THE DEFENSE WAS GOING. &gt;&gt; Mark: HIS FIRST INTERCEPTION
OF THE YEAR. OF.
&gt;&gt; Rod: GREAT PLAY. BUT YOUR QUARTERBACK HAS TO BE
CAREFUL WITH THE FOOTBALL DOWN THERE.
HAS TO LOOK FOR THAT. &gt;&gt; Mark: TWO TIMES NOW CAL HAS
GOTTEN PRETTY DEEP INTO WASHINGTON STATE TASHT TERRITORY
AND COME UP EMPTY. &gt;&gt; Rod: THOSE TWO POSSESSION,
THE LAST TWO POSSESSIONS, CAL COMES UP EMPTY, A PENALTY THAT
LED TO A MISSED FIELD GOAL AND THEN A PICK IN THE END ZONE.
AND THAT IS THE KIND OF THING THAT CAN REALLY DEMORALIZE A
TEAM. &gt;&gt; Mark: SIX YARDS ON THAT LAST
PLAY. SECOND AND FOUR.
BALL DOWN IN THE BACK FIELD. COMPLETE TOMORROW.
MOR OWE A NICE BLOCK JUST AS HE MADE THE CATCH FROM SWEDE.
AND HE PICKS UP 13 YARDS. &gt;&gt; Rod: WATCH THIS BLOCK ON THE
RIGHT SIDE. HE GOT THE HEAD TO THE SIDE AND
THE ARM IN FRONT SO IT IS A CLEAN BLOCK.
&gt;&gt; Mark: OUT TO THE 40. THEY GO EMPTY THIS TIME.
FIVE RECEIVERS ON THE PLAY. AND WILLIAMS SETS IN THE BACK
FIELD. GOTBACK TO THE 40 YARD LINE.
NO GAIN ON THE PLAY. SECOND DOWN COMING UP.
UNDER THREE MINUTES TO GO. WASHINGTON STATE LOOKING FOR
THEIR SEVENTH CONSECUTIVE WIN IN CONFERENCE PLAY.
STARTING 7-0 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SCHOOL HISTORY.
AND AS OF THIS MOMENT THEY LEAD</description>

PUSHES BACK SO THAT THE DEFENDER CAN'T JUMP.
&gt;&gt; HOLD ON. YOU USUALLY CALL THAT INCIDENTAL
CONTACT, DON'T YOU? &gt;&gt; Rod: NO HE IMPEDED THE
DEFENDER FROM MAKING A PLAY I'M TELLING YOU.
&gt;&gt; Mark: NICE BLOCK ON THE DEFENDER SCREEN.
DOWN TO THE SIX YARD LINE. VEASY WITH A BLOCK.
SO THAT WASN'T -- &gt;&gt; IN MY VIEW IT WAS.
NOW THE OFFICIALS LOOKED AT IT AND HEY, 50/50 BALL, JOCKEYING
FOR POSITION. GO GET IT BUT I SAW A CLEAR LEFT
HAND PUSH OFF TO HELP HIM OUT. IT HAPPENS.
&gt;&gt; Mark: MUHAMMAD. STOUT DEFENSE UP FRONT BY
GARRETT McGROOM. THIRD DOWN COMING UP.
&gt;&gt; Rod: THEY ARE STAYING WITHIN CONTACT OF WASHINGTON STATE.
&gt;&gt; Mark: THIRD AND THREE. CONNECTED ON 13 OF HIS LAST 15
PASSES. INTO THE END ZONE.
PICKED OFF. PICKED OFF IN THE END ZONE AND
RAN IT OUT. &gt;&gt; Rod: WEBB LOOK AT THE
RECEIVER BUT DIDN'T SURVEY THE COVERAGE.
HE HAD LINEBACKERS FLOWING. JUST TAKE LOOK RIGHT THERE.
LOOK AT THAT. HE'S GOT LINEBACKERS FLOWING
RIGHT INTO THE SLANT WHERE HE WAS LOOKING BUT HE NEVER LOOKED
FOR WHERE THE DEFENSE WAS GOING. &gt;&gt; Mark: HIS FIRST INTERCEPTION
OF THE YEAR. OF.
&gt;&gt; Rod: GREAT PLAY. BUT YOUR QUARTERBACK HAS TO BE
CAREFUL WITH THE FOOTBALL DOWN THERE.
HAS TO LOOK FOR THAT. &gt;&gt; Mark: TWO TIMES NOW CAL HAS
GOTTEN PRETTY DEEP INTO WASHINGTON STATE TASHT TERRITORY
AND COME UP EMPTY. &gt;&gt; Rod: THOSE TWO POSSESSION,
THE LAST TWO POSSESSIONS, CAL COMES UP EMPTY, A PENALTY THAT
LED TO A MISSED FIELD GOAL AND THEN A PICK IN THE END ZONE.
AND THAT IS THE KIND OF THING THAT CAN REALLY DEMORALIZE A
TEAM. &gt;&gt; Mark: SIX YARDS ON THAT LAST
PLAY. SECOND AND FOUR.
BALL DOWN IN THE BACK FIELD. COMPLETE TOMORROW.
MOR OWE A NICE BLOCK JUST AS HE MADE THE CATCH FROM SWEDE.
AND HE PICKS UP 13 YARDS. &gt;&gt; Rod: WATCH THIS BLOCK ON THE
RIGHT SIDE. HE GOT THE HEAD TO THE SIDE AND
THE ARM IN FRONT SO IT IS A CLEAN BLOCK.
&gt;&gt; Mark: OUT TO THE 40. THEY GO EMPTY THIS TIME.
FIVE RECEIVERS ON THE PLAY. AND WILLIAMS SETS IN THE BACK
FIELD. GOTBACK TO THE 40 YARD LINE.
NO GAIN ON THE PLAY. SECOND DOWN COMING UP.
UNDER THREE MINUTES TO GO. WASHINGTON STATE LOOKING FOR
THEIR SEVENTH CONSECUTIVE WIN IN CONFERENCE PLAY.
STARTING 7-0 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SCHOOL HISTORY.
AND AS OF THIS MOMENT THEY LEAD</description>

      <description> âªâª
MY NAME IS DOUG BALD WITH IN WITH THE SEATTLE SEAHAWKS.
I WANT TO GIVE A SPECIAL THANK YOU TO THE MEMBERS OF THE
SERVICE THAT SERVE OUR COUNTRY AND THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO
DO WHAT WE DO AND WHAT WE LOVE. THANK YOU.
JAYMEE: 8:33 EASTERN TIME. JAYMEE BACK
WITH YOU HERE ON "SPORTSCENTER:AM."
RANDY: TIME TO TALK WIDE RECEIVERS.
YOUNG, BRASH, SCRUTINIZED AND TALENTED.
IF THERE IS NOW 0-1 WHO KNOWS WHAT ODELL BECKHAM JR. IS
DEALING WITH IN HIS YOUNG CAREER.
IT IS RANDY MOSS. HE WORKS FOR US NOW.
HE ASKED THE YOUNG RECEIVER HOW HE MANAGED TO HANDLE SO MUCH
SUCCESS SO EARLY IN HIS CAREER. &gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK TOO MANY 22,
23, 24-YEAR-OLDS COULD HAVE HANDLED EVERYTHING THAT WAS
THROWN MY WAY IN THE RIGHT WAY. IT IS A LOT TO DEAL WITH AND
EVERYBODY IS WEIRING TO BE SOMEBODY ELSE OR YOU THINK THE
GRASS IS GREENER ON THE OTHER SIDE.
IT IS NOT ALWAYS GREENER ON THE OTHER SIDE AND NOT ALWAYS WHAT
YOU WOULD EXPECT. IT HAS BEEN A LOT.
I HAVE HAD TO ADJUST MY ENTIRE LIFE TO IT.
AND COMING FROM SOMEBODY WHO HAS NEVER KNOWN ANYTHING BUT
FOOTBALL AND THINKING FOOTBALL IS A TOUGH PICTURE.
IT IS TOUGH TO PROCESS WHAT IS GOING ON EVERY NOW AND THEN.
FOR ME, I HAD A LOT OF GROWTH AS FAR AS BEING ABLE TO TAKE THE
GOOD WITH THE BAD. &gt;&gt; YES.
&gt;&gt; AND KNOWING THAT THE BAD IS FOR A REASON AND BEING OKAY WITH
IT. NOT IN THE SENSE OF BEING OKAY
WITH THE BAD BUT BEING ABLE TO HANDLE AND ACCEPT IT AND KNOWING
THERE IS GOOD COMING YOUR WAY. RANDY: GAME RECOGNIZING GAME
THERE. I'M NOT GOING TO SAY THAT ODELL
BECKHAM JR. IS A HALL OF FAMER NOW, RANDY MOSS IS.
ODELL HAS THE TALENT, JUST NEEDS MAYBE A QUARTERBACK THAT CAN
GIVE HIM THE FOOTBALL ON A REGULAR BASIS.
SEE THE FULL INTERVIEW ON SUNDAY COUNTDOWN.
JAYMEE: SHOTS FIRED. THE TOP TROPHY.
THE WINNER OF U.N.C.-TALK DUKEFOOTBALL GAMES GETS THAT TRY
RIGHT THERE. THE LIBERTY BELL.
RANKED NUMBER 17 IN THE COUNTRY. FROM THEIR OWN 18.
THROWS IS OVER THE MIDDLE AND INTERCEPTED BY ALONZO SAXTON AND
THAT WOULD DO IT. EMOTIONS VERY SAD FOR ONE OF
THESE MASCOTS. THE BLUE DEVIL ELATED.
THE BELL IS HIS. THE TAR HEEL.
RANDY: HE CAN RING IT. JAYMEE: I THINK I SAW A
SINGLETARY ROLL DOWN HIS FACE. RANDY: SINGLETARY.
JAYMEE: HAS FOND MEMORIES OF RINGING THE BELL IN VICTORY
MANY, MANY TIMES. DOESN'T WANT TO GIVE IT UP.
HE HAS TO, THOUGH. TOO BAD.
DUKE PLAYERS RUN ACROSS THE FIELD, TAKING THE BELL.
THAT IS OUR TOP TROPHY. RANDY: WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE
NEW DUKE HELMET? UGLY?
OR SUPER UGLY? NO, THEY ARE FINE.
ARIZONA STATE HOSTING UTAH. I SAY THAT BECAUSE OUR FRIEND
ABBEY THAT WORKS ON THE SHOW WENT TO ARIZONA STATE.
JAYMEE: SO DID MATT BARRIE. &gt;&gt; 31 YARDS.
THE TOUCHDOWN. RANDY: MANNY WILKINS.
THE TALENT IS THERE AND THE SPEED IS THERE.
THE UTES COULDN'T TACKLE HIM AND WILKINS WAS GONE.
ARIZONA STATE PLAYS SOME FUN FOOTBALL.
FUN TO WATCH IF YOU ARE WILLING TO STAY UP LATE TO SEE IT.
UTAH WOULD GET THE WIN. ARIZONA STATE NICE FIGHT.
JAYMEE: OUR TOP FIRST. AND THOUGHTHY DAVIS AND THE
PELICANS -- ANTHONY DAVIS AND THE PELICANS RESPONSIBLE FOR
THIS ONE THANKS TO THEIR FIRST WIN.
DAVIS A GREAT GAME. A PHENOMENAL ATHLETE.
TAKING THE PASS AND DUNKING IT AND THEN BLOCKING THE JABARI
PARKER SHOT ATTEMPT. MAKES THE JUMP SHOT IN THE LANE.
PELICANS LED BY SEVEN AFTER THREE QUARTERS.
THE FOURTH QUARTER. 11:1 TO GO IN THE GAME NOW.
HERE IS DAVIS AND HEAD COACH ALVIN GENTRY AFTERWARDS.
&gt;&gt; YELL, YEAH.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; O, OF COURSE, IT WAS RELIEF.
I MEAN ARE YOU KIDDING ME? &gt;&gt; YOU CAN PLAY FREE NOW, YOU
KNOW. SO, I'M JUST HAPPY WE FINALLY
GOT ONE. AND NOW WE CAN TRY TO GET THIS
THING ROLLING. JAYMEE: FALCONS WIN 112-106.
RANDY: I GOT A TOP DUNK AND COMING FROM THE LAKERS AND THAT
MAN, TIMOFEY MOZGOV. LEAD THE KINGS BY THREE AND THEN
THIS HAPPENED. &gt;&gt; MOZGOV CLIMBING IT, SLAMMING
IT AND PUTTING THE LAKERS UP BY THREE.
RANDY: ALL IN ONE MOTION. JAYMEE: WOW.
WOW. RANDY: THROWDOWN FROM MOZGOV.
LAKERS PLAYING GOOD BASKETBALL EARLY IN THE SEASON.
JAYMEE: WOW, WOW, WOW. GOT THE SCORING STARTED, TOP
GOALS. ARGENTINA, BRAZIL.
&gt;&gt; LOOK OUT. &gt;&gt; THIS IS ABSOLUTELY WORLD
CLASS! A MAGNIFICENT SHIFT AND THEY WIN
IT RIGHT HERE AND THEN THE ADJUSTMENT AND THEN A CROSS
BETWEEN A SLEDGE HAMMER AND AN ABSOLUTE PHENOMENAL STRIKE.
JAYMEE: I WISH I KNEW THAT RANDY: THAT WAS AMAZING.
JAYMEE: FIVE GOALS IN HIS LAST SEVEN GAMES FOR BRAZIL.
AND NEYMAR GOT IN THE ACTION ALONE WITH THE KEEPER AND JUST
NONES THAT ONE HOME. THAT IS MAKING IT LOOK EASY
THERE. 50TH INTERNATIONAL GOAL.
ONE OF FOUR BRAZILIANS TO SCORE 50 PLUS GOALS FOR THEIR COUNTRY.
BRAZIL WINS 3-0. RANDY: I GOT A TOP SAVE AND
MAYBE IF RYAN MILLER WAS PLAYING SOCCER HE COULD HAVE --
JAYMEE: WHOA. KEVIN: EMPTY NET.
HERE WE GO. &gt;&gt; AN EMPTY NET.
MILLER LOOK AT THE SAVE. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
ZETTERBERG HAD THE PUCK AT CENTER AND MILLER WAS THREE
QUARTERS OF THE WAY TO THE BENCH AND HUSTLE BACK AND DIVING.
HE REMINDED ME OF A SHORTSTOP IN BASEBALL.
A TERRIFIC SAVE BY MILLER. RANDY: STARTED TO THE BENCH AND
SAID I'M SICK OF SEEING PUCKS GO INTO EMPTY NETS.
YOU HEARD THE BASEBALL COMPARISON.
WHAT WOULD IT SOUND LIKE ON THE DIAMOND?
&gt;&gt; A LINE DRIVE BY MILLER AT SHORT TO RETIRE THE SIDE.
RANDY: NICE EDITING THERE. MILLER'S PARENTS WERE IN
ATTENDANCE. MAYBE IT IS A WEB GEM OR GOLDEN
GLOVE. THEY LOST BUT HE STILL IMPRESSED
DAD AND THAT IS A WIN IN ITS OWN RIGHT.
JAYMEE: THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING RIGHT THERE.
KEVIN: ZETTERBERG AND STEVE ON THE ROBBERY.
&gt;&gt; IT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE GONE OVER SO MIGHT AS WELL CATCH THAT
ONE. &gt;&gt; I'M SURE THERE WILL BE
DETROIT TIGERS THAT WERE WATCHING THE GAME AND PRETTY
PROUD OF THAT. RANDY: PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BON E
IN? REDS WIN.
JAYMEE: WE HONOR THOSE WHO SALUTE AND SERVE OUR TROOPS.
THE FIFTH ANNUAL ARMED FORCES CLASSIC FROM HONOLULU.

      <description> I USE WHAT'S ALREADY INSIDE ME               TO REACH MY GOALS.                SO I LIKED WHEN
               MY DOCTOR TOLD ME THAT I MAY REACH MY BLOOD
SUGAR AND A1C GOALS BY ACTIVATING WHAT'S WITHIN ME   WITH ONCE-WEEKLY TRULICITY. TRULICITY IS
NOT INSULIN. IT HELPS ACTIVATE
MY BODY TO DO WHAT
IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO RELEASE ITS
OWN INSULIN.     TRULICITY RESPONDS WHEN
    MY BLOOD SUGAR RISES.      I TAKE IT ONCE A WEEK,
     AND IT WORKS 24/7.  IT COMES IN AN EASY-TO-USE PEN       AND I MAY EVEN LOSE
      A LITTLE WEIGHT. TRULICITY IS A ONCE-WEEKLY
INJECTABLE PRESCRIPTION MEDICINE   TO IMPROVE BLOOD SUGAR IN
  ADULTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES.     IT SHOULD BE USED ALONG
    WITH DIET AND EXERCISE.   TRULICITY IS NOT RECOMMENDED
  AS THE FIRST MEDICINE   TO TREAT DIABETES AND SHOULD
  NOT BE USED BY PEOPLE      WITH SEVERE STOMACH OR
     INTESTINAL PROBLEMS  OR PEOPLE WITH TYPE I DIABETES
 OR DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS.     TRULICITY IS NOT INSULIN    AND HAS NOT BEEN STUDIED
   WITH LONG-ACTING INSULIN.   DO NOT TAKE TRULICITY IF YOU
  OR ANYONE IN YOUR FAMILY HAS HAD MEDULLARY THYROID CANCER    OR MULTIPLE ENDOCRINE
   NEOPLASIA SYNDROME TYPE 2  OR IF YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO
 TRULICITY OR ITS INGREDIENTS.   STOP USING TRULICITY AND
  CALL YOUR DOCTOR RIGHT AWAY     IF YOU HAVE SYMPTOMS OF
    AN ALLERGIC REACTION,     SUCH AS ITCHING, RASH,
    OR DIFFICULTY BREATHING;        IF YOU HAVE SIGNS
       OF PANCREATITIS SUCH AS SEVERE STOMACH PAIN
THAT WILL NOT GO AWAY    AND MAY MOVE TO YOUR BACK,   WITH OR WITHOUT VOMITING OR IF YOU HAVE SYMPTOMS
OF THYROID CANCER,    WHICH MAY INCLUDE A LUMP
   OR SWELLING IN YOUR NECK, HOARSENESS, TROUBLE SWALLOWING,
OR SHORTNESS OF BREATH.   MEDICINES LIKE TRULICITY
  MAY CAUSE STOMACH PROBLEMS,      WHICH COULD BE SEVERE.    TELL YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT ALL
   YOUR MEDICAL CONDITIONS   AND ANY MEDICINES YOU TAKE.     TAKING TRULICITY WITH A
    SULFONYLUREA OR INSULIN      MAY INCREASE YOUR RISK
     FOR LOW BLOOD SUGAR.   COMMON SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE
  NAUSEA, DIARRHEA, VOMITING,       DECREASED APPETITE,
      AND INDIGESTION.      SOME SIDE EFFECTS CAN
     LEAD TO DEHYDRATION,  WHICH MAY CAUSE KIDNEY FAILURE.    WITH TRULICITY, I CLICK TO
   ACTIVATE WHAT'S WITHIN ME. IF YOU WANT HELP IMPROVING YOUR
A1C AND BLOOD SUGAR NUMBERS    WITH A NON-INSULIN OPTION,  CLICK TO ACTIVATE YOUR WITHIN.      ASK YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT
     ONCE-WEEKLY TRULICITY.             Mm-hmm.            Call Now.</description>

DWYANE: THE WEIRDEST BASKETBALL GAME I EVER PLAYED IN MY LIE.
 LIFE. I COULDN'T WAIT UNTIL IT WAS
OVER. FANS WERE GREAT.
I APPRECIATE IT. JAYMEE: DWYANE WADE MAKING HIS
RETURN TO MIAMI AND DAN LE BATARD THE HOST OF THE DAN LE
BATARD SHOW WITH STUGOTZ AND ESPN'S "HIGHLY QUESTIONABLE."
HE WAS AT THE GAME. GIVE US AN IDEA WHAT THE
ATMOSPHERE WAS LIKE AT DWYANE WADE MADE HIS RETURN LAST NIGHT?
DAN: IT WAS WARM, IT WAS NICE. THEY VALUE HIM AND APPRECIATE
HIM AND VERY FEW ATHLETES IN THE HISTORY OF ANY CITY AND SPORTS
HAVE EVER MEANT TO THEIR CITY WHAT DWYANE WADE INENT TO THIS
ONE BUT ALSO FELT BAD, IT FELT WRONG.
THE CAREER LEADER IN WINS AND STEALS AND ASSISTS AND POINTS.
SEEING HIM IN ANOTHER UNIFORM DID NOT HAVE TO BE THAT WAY.
THE BUSINESS INTRUDING ON SOME OF THE FEEL-GOOD AND BOTH SIDES
WOULD HAVE PREVENTED THAT FROM HAPPENING.
EITHER SIDE. IF THE HEAT WANTED TO HAVE KEPT
HIM HERE THEY WOULD HAVE AND IF HE WANTED TO HAVE STAYED HERE,
HE WOULD HAVE. SO THAT PART OF IT DIDN'T -- IT
JUST FELT WRONG TO -- HE SAID WEIRD BECAUSE HE IS ALWAYS
DIPLOMATIC BUT IT FELT WRONG. RANDY: WE WERE TRYING TO BAT
AROUND COMPARISONS AS TO WHAT THAT IS LIKE.
A PARALLEL FOR SOUTH FLORIDA SPORTS AND CAME BACK WITH DAN
MARINO MAYBE COMING BACK AS A MEMBER OF THE STEELERS.
LIKE GOING TO A HOMETOWN TEAM THAT HAD HISTORY.
THE LONGER HE PLAYS THE MORE HE RISKS HIS LEGACY IN SOUTH
FLORIDA AND HOW HE WILL BE REMBERED, TRUE OR FALSE?
DAN: HE DID SO MANY GOOD THINGS IN THE COMMUNE THE AND WAS
REALLY CONNECTED TO IT AND DID GOOD IMPORTANT WORK AND ONE OF
THE DIFFERENCES WITH THE DAN MARINO COMPARISON THAT YOU ARE
BRINGING UP IS DAN MARINO HAD A CHANCE TO PLAY FOR THE VIKINGS.
HE DID NOT. HE LOST 62-7 HIS LAST GAME.
MARINO WAS FINISHED AT THE END. WADE IS NOT QUITE FINISHED.
OBVIOUSLY ON THE WRONG SIDE OF AGE, BUT HE IS STILL A VERY GOOD
BASKETBALL PLAYER. AND IT WAS JUST TROOPER STANINGO
SEE HOW SOME OF THAT PLAYED OUT BECAUSE I TALKED TO PAT RILEY
SOME THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS INCLUDING LAST NIGHT.
IT DID NOT HAVE TO ABOUT HE THIS WAY.
THIS RELATIONSHIP BROKE APART WHEN THE MIAMI HEAT WENT AFTER
KEVIN DURANT. THEY WANTED HIS HELP IN GOING
AFTER KEVIN DURANT. THEY WANTED HIM TO BE THEIR DIRK
NOWITZKI. KEEP WORKING ON DISCOUNTS AND WE
LL TAKE CARE OF YOU AT THE END THE WAY MARK CUBAN TOOK CARE OF
DIRK NOWITZKI AT THE END. WHEN THE INTERESTS STOP BEING
ALIGNED AS THEY WERE AT THE END AND PAT RILEY STILL THOUGHT THEY
WERE ALIGNED. HE WAS LIKE WE ARE PARTNERS.
DWYANE WADE WAS LIKE I AM NOT HELPING YOU RECRUIT KEVIN DURANT
AND THAT IS WHERE EVERYTHING FELL APART.
JAYMEE: RILEY SAID BEFORE THE GAME HE REACHED OUT TO WADE VIA
E-MAIL. WADE SAID HE HAD NOT READ THE
E-MAIL YET. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEIR
RELATIONSHIP AND HOW OTHER MEMBERS KIND OF LEFT MIAMI WITH
A LITTLE BIT OF SOUR TASTE IN THEIR MOUTH BECAUSE OF PAT
RILEY. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE WHOLE
SITUATION, DAN? DAN: IT IS JUST BUSINESS
INTRUDING AT THE END. RELATIONSHIPS ARE WARM AND
BUSINESS IS COLD AND THERE IS NO GOOD WAY TORE YOU TO BREAK UP ON
THESE THINGS. THEY NEEDED TO TAKE CARE OF THE
FUTURE. HERE IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT
HAPPENED, RIGHT, BECAUSE LAST NIGHT FEELS WRONG, BECAUSE
ELEMENTS OF IT FEEL BAD, WE GO LACKING FOR PLACES TO BLAME
PEOPLE. BUT HERE THE BLAME IS EQUALLY
DISTRIBUTED. IF YOU MUST BLAME.
I DON'T THINK THERE IS BLAME HERE.
I THINK IT WAS JUST TIME FOR EVERYBODY TO BREAK UP.
I DON'T THINK THAT YOU HAVE TO BLAME JUST BECAUSE IT FEELS BAD
EVEN THOUGH IT DOES FEEL BAD BUT PEOPLE WILL DO THAT.
INSTEAD OF DISBURSING THE BLAME YOU ARE GOING TO PUT IT IN ONE
PLACE AND BE ABSOLUTE ABOUT IT. DWYANE WADE IS NOT GOING TO LOOK
IN A MIRROR AND BLAME HIMSELF. HE IS GOING TO BLAME PAT RILEY.
PAT RILEY IS NOT GOING TO LOOK IN A MIRROR AND BLAME HIMSELF,
HE IS GOING TO BLAME DWYANE WADE.
WE HAD THREE BREAKUPS. ALL THREE ARE LOUSY BREAKUPS.
KEVIN: ONE OF JAYMEE'S FAVORITE MOVIES FROM THE 1980'S
"COCKTAIL" THAT IS TRUE. RANDY: NOTHING REALLY ENDS WELL
UNLESS IT ENDS. JAYMEE: I DID NOT.
DAN: YOU JUST REFERENCED A TOM CRUISE BAR TENDING MOVIES IN THE
1980S TO APPLY IT TO THIS SITUATION.
A TERRIBLE TOM CRUISE 1980S MOVIE I MIGHT ADD.
JAYMEE: NOT MY FAVORITE MOVIE. RANDY: THE WORLD CHAMPS IN THE
WHITE HOUSE AND THE ELECTION STORY THAT YOU SPENT A GOOD
PORTION OF YOUR SHOW YESTERDAY TALKING ABOUT AND THE REVERB
RATION IN SPORTS. JAKES ARRIETA TWEET THE ALL OF
THE CELEBRITIES SAID THEY ARE LEAVE THE COUNTRY IF TRUMP WON,
GOOD RIDDANCE. WHAT DO YOU THINK?
DAN: THAT IS A GOOD SOCIETAL CONFERENCE.
I WOULD LIKE TO IMMERSE OURSELVES IN COCKTAILS.
DO PEOPLE REALIZE -- I WANT TO PLAY A GAME WITH YOU GUYS.
NAME A TOM CRUISE MOVIE. NAME A TOM CRUISE MOVIE.
&gt;&gt; TOP GUN. &gt;&gt; COCKY FIGHTER PILOT.
GIVE ME ANOTHER ONE. RANDY: THE FIRM.
JAYMEE: THE DREAM. DAN: A COCKY PERSON BEFORE HIS
FACE GOT DEFORMED. DAYS OF THUNDER.
COCKY RACE CAR DRIVER. RANDY: RISKY BUSINESS.
DAN: A COCKY TEENAGER. RANDY: CITIZEN KANE.
DAN: HE WASN'T IN CITIZEN KANE. RANDY: I WAS TRYING TO STEAL
YOUR SEGMENT. DAN: NAME A MOVIE WHERE HE IS
NOT COULDINGY. RANDY: ALL THE RIGHT MOVES.
DAN: COCKY. KEVIN: LAST SAMURAI.
HE WAS A COCKY SAMURAI. DAN: OF COURSE.
A COCKY SAMURAI. SOMEBODY NAME A MOVIE.
BORN ON THE 4TH OF JULY. JAYMEE: LIKE A SAPPY ONE LIKE A
LOVE STORY ONE. RANDY: WAS HE IN A LOVE STORY?
JAYMEE: MAYBE I'M MAKING THAT UP.
RANDY: WAS THAT THE NOTEBOOK? JAYMEE: THAT WAS RYAN GOSLING.
DAN: TOM CRUISE KNOWLEDGE RIGHT HERE.
JAYMEE: DAN LE BATARD JUST HIJACKED THE SEGMENT.
RANDY: EYES WIDE SHUT. DAN: A COCKY SEXUAL DEVIANT.
A COCKY SWINGER. JAYMEE: WE ARE OFF THE RAIL.
IT'S FRIDAY. DAN: THIS IS THE RAIL.
I. RANDY: I WANTED TO TALK ELECTION
AND YOU ARE LIKE TOM CRUISE. DAN: GET OUT OF HERE.
RANDY: HE'S LEAVING. JAYMEE: HAVE AIATE WEEKEND, DAN,
WE LOVE YOU. RANDY: MORE "SPORTSCENTER"
COMING UP. THE NOT TOP 10 PLAYS -- OH, T                âª                âªâª           $100 dollars. JAYMEE: 9:00 A.M. HERE ON THE
EAST COAST. TWO HOURS IN THE BOOKS.
"SPORTSCENTER:A.M." SARINA MORALES, RANDY SCOTT.
I'M JAYMEE SIRE. SARINA: IT'S A SPECIAL DAY HERE
ON. SAGE: AS WE SALUTE ANYONE WHO
HAS OR IS CURRENTLY SERVING OUR MILITARY WITH TODAY BEING
VETERANS DAY. WE HAVE COVERAGE FROM PEARL
HARBOR AND ARLINGTON THIS HOUR ON.
SAGE. DON'T MISS WHAT WE HAVE IN
STORE. RANDY: I KNOW YOUR DAD WAS AIR
FORCE. WE HAVE MILITARY SERVICE HISTORY
IN MY FAMILY AS WELL. WE'RE PROUD TO HONOR OUR FAMILY
AS WELL AND BEYOND, AND ARLINGTON IS A GREAT PLACE TO DO
THAT, AS IS PEARL HARBOR. WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO TALK
SPORTS ON "SPORTSCENTER:A.M." A REUNION OF SORTS IN MIAMI LAST
NIGHT AS DWYANE WADE RETURNED TO THE PLACE WHERE HE HELPED BRING
THREE TITLES. &gt;&gt; BEING HERE WAS GREAT.
IT FELT NORMAL, UNTIL I WENT INSIDE THE BUILDING.</description>

      <description>CARPENTER WHO'S BEEN A VERY GOOD
KICKER FOR A LONG TIME HE MADE A LOT OF FIELD GOALS FOR THE
DOLPHINS, HE'S DONE A GREAT JOB AS A BUFFALO BILL AND THIS COULD
POTENTIALLY MAKE THIS A ONE-SCORE GAME.
&gt;&gt; Sean: THREE MISSES THIS YEAR, ALL OF THEM FROM 47 YARDS OR
LONGER AND THIS IS GOING TO BE ABOUT A 51-YARDER.
&gt;&gt; Jon: WATCH BOBBY WAGNER HE'S HAD HISTORY OF JUMPING OVER
PEOPLE IN THESE SITUATIONS. &gt;&gt; Sean: 53-YARD TRY.
WAGNER'S LOOKING TO THE SIDELINE.
&gt;&gt; Jon: HE'S LOOKING FOR PERMISSION.
&gt;&gt; Sean: OH, BOY, ARE THEY OFFSIDE.
IT WENT THROUGH WHEN THEY ATTEMPTED THE KICK.
CARPENTER DOWN GRABBING HIS KNEE AS RICHARD SHERMAN HIT HIM.
IT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS IN AGONY AND ALL OF A SUDDEN HE'S UP
TELLING THE MEDICAL PEOPLE HE'S OKAY.
&gt;&gt; Jon: SHOULD BE A PERSONAL FOUL.
&gt;&gt; Referee: PRIOR TO THE SNAP, OFFSIDE, NUMBER 25, DEFENSE,
FIVE-YARD PENALTY. &gt;&gt; Jon: I'M SURPRISED THAT'S NOT
A PERSONAL FOUL FOR ROUGHING THE KICKER AS WELL WHICH WOULD BE 15
YARDS. &gt;&gt; Sean: PETE CARROLL CAN'T BE
ARGUING ABOUT THE OFFSIDE, NEVER SEEN ANYONE MORE CLEARLY OFFSIDE
THAN THAT. SO, NOW, IT WILL BE A 48-YARD
TRY. CARPENTER LOOKED LIKE FOR A
MOMENT HE WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED. 1 FOR 1 TONIGHT FROM 31 YARDS.
HE'S NOW MADE 101 FIELD GOALS AS A BUFFALO BILL AFTER 127 IN
MIAMI. THE OFFICIALS WITH A LONG
CONFERENCE. &gt;&gt; Referee: THE OFFSIDE PENALTY
WILL BE ENFORCED ON NUMBER 25. TRAINERS COME ON TO FIELD TO
ATTEND TO NUMBER 22, THIS WILL BE A CHARGED TIME-OUT FOR
BUFFALO. NUMBER 2 WILL HAVE TO LEAVE THE
GAME. &gt;&gt; Sean: MY GOODNESS, WHICH
MEANS THEY CAN'T TRY THE FIELD GOAL.
THEY'LL HAVE TO HAVE SOMEBODY ELSE TRY THE FIELD GOAL.
THE PLAYERS ARE GOING TO THE LOCKER ROOM.
THEY THINK IT'S HALFTIME. &gt;&gt; Referee: THE HALF IS NOT
OVER. &gt;&gt; Sean: WALT ANDERSON SEEING
EVERYBODY RUNNING OFF THE FIELD. TELLING THEM THEY HAVE TO COME
BACK. &gt;&gt; Jon: I DON'T EBB KNOW WHAT
ROUGHING THE KICKER IS. JERRY AUSTIN, FIRST AND
FOREMOST, SHERMAN WAS CLEARLY WAY OFFSIDE, THERE WERE FLAGS
AND WHISTLES BUT HE CONTINUED. IN THAT INSTANCE, DID THE
OFFICIALS GIVE HIM THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT DIDN'T HEAR THE
WHISTLE AND CONTINUED THE PLAY. &gt;&gt; IF YOU CONTINUE AFTER THE
PLAY, YOU'RE GOING TO GET THAT 15-YARD PENALTY.
THEY SHOULD HAVE HAD A 15-YARD PENALTY ON ROUGHING THE KICKER
HERE. AND SHUT IT DOWN AND SINCE HE
WAS INJURED BY A FOUL THEN HE WOULD BE --
&gt;&gt; Referee: THE HALF IS NOT OVER, THERE ARE 3 SECONDS ON THE
CLOCK. &gt;&gt; HE HAS TO GO OUT BUT THERE'S
TEN-SECOND RUNOFF BECAUSE THE CLOCK WAS STOPPED.
&gt;&gt; Jon: HOW CAN THEY NOT MAKE THE CALL?
THE KICKER GOT HURT. THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE TO ME AND I
GUESS, COLTON SCHMIDT IS GOING TO HAVE TO KICK THE BALL.
&gt;&gt; Sean: HERE'S WHAT THE REX RYAN IS SAYING, SPIKE THE BALL
FAST. THEY'LL TRY THE FIELD GOAL.
AND NOW, THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MEN ON THE FIELD.
THE OFFICIALS ARE STILL STANDING OVER THE BALL.
VERY QUICK SPIKE TO STOP THE CLOCK AND THEN GET CARPENTER OUT
THERE. &gt;&gt; I DON'T BELIEVE I HAVE SEEN
THIS BUT I THINK THERE'S A GOOD CASE FOR HAVING THE ROUGHER THE
KICKER ON THIS PLAY BECAUSE 25 DID CONTINUE TO HIT HIM.
&gt;&gt; Sean: DOUBLE WHAMMY FOR REX RYAN AND BUFFALO.
THEY DON'T GET THE ROUGHING THE KICKER CALL AND THEY HAVE TO DO
THIS TO STOP THE CLOCK WITH ONE SECOND TO GO.
NOW, CARPENTER WILL COME BACK OUT.
SO, SEATTLE WHICH HAS DONE A LOT OF TALKING ABOUT THE
OFFICIATING. YOU SAID IT EARLIER, IT EVENS
OUT. THE ATLANTA PEOPLE ARE STILL
TALKING ABOUT JULIO JONES ATTEND OF THIS GAME HERE.
&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT HAPPENED IN SEATTLE, WE HAD THE HAIL MARY
HERE, THE BATTED BALL LAST YEAR, I HAVE HAD SOME EPISODES WHEN I
COACHED, EVERY TIME YOU COME TO SEATTLE ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN.
&gt;&gt; Sean: SO, NOW, HERE'S CARPENTER TO BRING AN TEND A
WILD FIRST HALF AND FITTINGLY IT IS GOOD.
BUT FITTINGLY THEY TOOK TOO MUCH TIME
&gt;&gt; Referee: PRIOR TO THE SNAP, DELAY OF GAME, OFFENSE.
FIVE-YARD PENALTY. ONE SECOND ON THE CLOCK.
&gt;&gt; Jon: THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE. &gt;&gt; Sean: MY GOODNESS.
&gt;&gt; Jon: COLTON SCHMIDT ARGUING WITH THE REFEREE, HE THOUGHT HE
GOT A NEW 25. THESE ARE VETERAN PLAYERS.
CARPENTER HAS KICKED HIS WHOLE LIFE.
PLAY CLOCK ON YOUR LEFT. &gt;&gt; Sean: THE OFFICIAL DIDN'T
BACK AWAY FROM THE FOOTBALL UNTIL THERE WERE FIVE SECONDS
LEFT ON THE CLOCK. NOW IT'S A 54-YARD TRY.
AND THAT'S NO GOOD! REX RYAN LOOKED LIKE HE COULDN'T
DECIDE WHETHER HE WANTED TO GIVE THE OFFICIAL AN EARFUL OR JUST
WALK OFF. HE DECIDED RESTRAINT WAS THE
BETTER WAY TO GO. &gt;&gt; Jon: I DIDN'T LIKE THAT
SEQUENCE AT ALL. BUFFALO SHOULD HAVE GOT THE
15-YARD PENALTY AND I DIDN'T LIKE THEY DIDN'T START THAT 25
SHOT CLOCK. IT'S AN 11-POINT HALFTIME LEAD
FOR SEATTLE. &gt;&gt; Sean: DELAY OF GAME PENALTY
WHEN THE OFFICIAL STOOD OVER THE BALL.
SEAHAWKS LEAD AT THE HALF.</description>

      <description>LOOK AT THE BOTTOM, YOU SEE THE
MATCHUP WITH PETTIS. STUTTER STEP, DOUBLE MOVE,
GOODBYE. THAT'S WHY YOU GRAB.
THAT'S SIX. &gt;&gt; Mark: GOOD ONE WORTH TAKING,
RIGHT? &gt;&gt; Rod: YEAH.
YOU DON'T WANT THE BAND THE KEEP PLAYING, RIGHT?
&gt;&gt; Mark: GETTING TO KNOW THAT SONG BY HEART RIGHT NOW.
FIRST AND TEN. SWEEP INTO THE BOUNDARY,
McCLATCHER. BROUGHT DOWN WITH 44 SECONDS TO
GO IN THE THIRD QUARTER. &gt;&gt; Rod: NOW, WE'VE BEEN TALKING
ABOUT THE HUSKIES AND THEIR RANKING IN THE COLLEGE FOOTBALL
PLAYOFFS. DON'T FORGET THERE IS STILL A
PAC-12 RACE. &gt;&gt; Mark: YES.
YES, THERE SURE IS. &gt;&gt; Rod: HUSKIES ARE ALIVE AND
WELL BUT SO ARE THE COUGARS. &gt;&gt; Mark: COLORADO MAYBE BEING
THE SURPRISE. &gt;&gt; Rod: ABSOLUTELY.
&gt;&gt; Mark: SECOND AND FIFTH. BROWNING COMPLETES IT TO ROSS.
ROSS, MAN, HE'S BEEN SAUCING ALL OVER THAT SECONDARY ALL NIGHT.
FOUR SECONDS TO GO IN THE THIRD QUARTER.
HAS THREE TOUCHDOWNS TONIGHT, SIX CATCHES FOR 208 YARDS.
THAT'S THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER.
HUSKIES, GOT A LOT OF FIGHT IN THEIR BARK TONIGHT.
BACK AFTER THIS.                âª                âª</description>

      <description>   WHEN YOU FREEZE SOMETHING,         IT'S FOR LATER.       BUT HOW MUCH LATER?    THERE'S NO WAY TO BE SURE!           BUT WENDY'S IS SURE
          THAT IF YOU WANT       A JUICY, DELICIOUS
      HAMBURGER, RIGHT NOW    IT SHOULD BE MADE WITH
   FRESH, NEVER-FROZEN BEEF.     UNLIKE SOME OTHER GUYS. SO THAT'S WHAT'S IN EVERY SINGLE
HAMBURGER WENDY'S SERVES.         AND THE DOUBLES.         AND THE TRIPLES.      BECAUSE, AT WENDY'S,
     FRESH NEVER GETS OLD.                   Can I say it?
Go Ahead! . .
&gt;&gt; Mark: FOUR WEEKS TO GO, AND FOLKS REMEMBER NOVEMBER.
THERE'S GOING TO BE AN INTERESTING RACE IN THE PAC-12,
ESPECIALLY IN THE -- NORTH DIVISION WITH COLORADO DOING
WELL. HOW DO YOU SEE THINGS SHAPING
UP? &gt;&gt; Rod: I THINK IN THE NORTH IT
IS PRETTY CLEAR IT IS GOING TO BE WASHINGTON STATE, AND IN THE
SOUTH SC IS COMING ON BUT COLORADO A SURPRISE.
&gt;&gt; Mark: SECOND AND FOUR, BROWNING.
GONNA TAKE A SHOT. TRY TO RING UP THE PASS,
REGISTER AGAIN. A FLAG THROWN.
IT WAS INTENDED FOR McCLATCHER. &gt;&gt; Rod: WELL, AT SOME POINT THE
I'LL TAKE THE PASS INTERFERENCE CALL BECOMES AN UNACCEPTABLE WAY
TO PLAY DEFENSE, BUT IT HAS TO BE THE THIRD OR FOURTH ONE
TONIGHT FOR CAL. &gt;&gt; Referee: PASS INTERFERENCE,
DEFENSE, NUMBER 23. AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN.
&gt;&gt; Rod: THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO LOOK AT IT, BUT THESE WIDE
RECEIVERS ARE CRUSHING CAL'S SECONDARY, AND THESE ARE GUYS
WHO ARE GAMELY TRYING TO DO THEIR BEST.
CAL HAS LOST A NUMBER OF PLAYERS.
AS I MENTIONED EARLIER, THEY LOST ONE OF THEIR STARTING
CORNERS, ALLENSWORTH, JUST BEFORE THE BALL GAME.
USA OF THESE GUYS ARE STRUGGLING AGAINST ELITE RECEIVERS.
&gt;&gt; Mark: YEAH, JOHN ROSS ONE OF THEM RIGHT NOW.
THREE TOUCHDOWNS TONIGHT, PETTIS WITH THREE.
FROM THE 17. âª
âª &gt;&gt; COULD IT BE?
IT'S COMING THE OTHER WAY. TOUCHDOWN.
&gt;&gt; TO THE FIVE, TOUCHDOWN. &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; LEAPING INTO THE END ZONE. &gt;&gt; BIG, OUT OF TROUBLE.
&gt;&gt; Mark: MAN, IS HE GOOD. &gt;&gt; Rod: HE GETS A HANS TO MAKE
EVERYBODY MISS. &gt;&gt; Mark: HE JUST MADE THE SPORTS
CENTER TOP TEN. &gt;&gt; WHAT A CATCH BY BUCKY HODGES.
&gt;&gt; LOOKS AS IF HE CAUGHT IT ONE HANDED.
&gt;&gt; BOWLER, TWO FLEXES, STRICKLAND.
&gt;&gt; AND THIS IS RETURNABLE. &gt;&gt; AND HENDERSON INTO THE
SQUARE. &gt;&gt; 100 YARDS.
&gt;&gt; 99 YARDS. &gt;&gt; THAT BALL GETS PICKED OFF ON
A REDIRECTION. &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; BYU AND CINCINNATI, BYU WINS 20-3.
RUNNING BACK JAMAL WILLIAMS RUSHED FOR 92.
CINCINNATI HAVE NOW LOST FOUR OF THEIR LAST FIVE GAMES.
THE FANS ARE UPSET. THEY CHIRP AT TOMMY TUBBERVILLE,
AND HE HAS A RESPONSE. &gt;&gt; HEY, GO TO --.
GET A JOB. GET A JOB.
&gt;&gt; Mark: WHOA. OLD TOMMY BOY COACHED AT AUBURN
BACK IN THE DAY. NINTH RANKED AUBURN HOME TO
VANDERBILT ON SATURDAY. LOOK AT THE EFFORT.

ZACK CUNNINGHAM, LEAPING OVER BLOCKERS.                âªâª                âªâª &gt;&gt; LAIRD IN FOR WATSON AND
MUHAMMAD. AN INJURED PLAYER AND A FLAG ON
THE FIELD AS WELL. &gt;&gt; Referee: AFTER THE PLAY WAS
OVER, DEAD BALL, PERSONAL FOUL. NUMBER 15 ON THE DEFENSE.
15-YARD PENALTY. AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN.
&gt;&gt; Rod: THAT LOOKS LIKE IT IS McGARY WHO IS DOWN.
NO, IT IS NOT. &gt;&gt; Mark: 79, THERE HE IS.
&gt;&gt; Rod: OH, YEAH. &gt;&gt; Mark: GOT ROLLED UP ON,
PATRICK McKARI. &gt;&gt; Rod: YEAH, HIS RIGHT LEG.
GOOD TO SEE HIM WALKING OFF THE FIELD WITH ASSISTANCE.
&gt;&gt; Mark: LOOKED LIKE THEY JUST CHANGED THE PENALTY TO BRANDON
BEAVER, NUMBER NINE. IT WASN'T NUMBER 15.
IT WAS BRANDON BEAVER. THERE HE IS, NUMBER NINE FOR THE
HUSKIES. MAY BE ANOTHER TEACHING MOMENT
FOR COACH PETERSON AND A CHANCE FOR HIM TO -- AND HIS STAFF, ONE
OF HIS STAFF MEMBERS TO PUT A PLAYER, LEADING BY 39.
HERE'S THE SCREEN FOR LAIRD, AND LAIRD BROUGHT DOWN AFTER A GAIN
OF TWO ON THE PLAY BY BROOKHAVEN WHERE KIRVIN HAD THE
INTERCEPTION. UNDER 12 MINUTES TO GO. WASHINGTON IN CONTROL.
YOU START TALKING ABOUT CAL, FOUR WINS, DIVISION LEAD OUT OF
THEIR REACH, AND IT BECOMES AN ARGUMENT OF BOWL ELIGIBILITY OR
NOT. THAT PASS COMPLETE THE BRAN DIN
SINGLETON. &gt;&gt; Rod: THEY STILL HAVE A SHOT,
AND THE WAY THEY CAN SCORE OFFENSIVELY, THEY STILL HAVE A
CHANCE TO GET THERE. THEY HAVE WASHINGTON STATE NEXT
WEEK AND FINISH WITHSTAND FORWARD AND UCL, BOTH OF WHICH
HAVE STRUGGLED TO SCORE. YOU LOOK AT THOSE, AND YOU WOULD
THINK THE LATTER TWO, THEIR BEST CHANCE OF SCORING.
&gt;&gt; Mark: WEBB TRYING TO MAKE LEMONADE HERE, COMPLETE A PASS
AT THE 15-YARD LINE TO WORSTELL. &gt;&gt; Rod: THIS WAS A SEASON COMING
INTO IT I THINK SUNNY DIKES FELT HE HAD A TEAM THAT COULD GET TO
POST SEASON, AND AFTER THEY WERE WIPED OUT ON DEFENSIVE SIDE WITH
A NUMBER OF INJURIES AND ON THE BACK END AT THE SAFETY SPOT AND
THE CORNER, THINK HE STARTED GETTING CONCERNED THAT GETTING
TO POST SEASON MIGHT BE A CHALLENGE.
&gt;&gt; Mark: SECOND AND SEVEN. LAIRD AGAIN.
GOT TO THE EDGE AND IS TACKLED RIGHT AROUND THE 10-YARD LINE --
PARDON ME, THE FIVE-YARD LINE BY THE DEFENSE STILL IN HEAVY
PURSUIT. AN EIGHT YARD GAIN ON THE PLAY.
IS BLOCKED BY COCHRAN OUT THERE. WITH SOME GOOD SIZE ON THE
INTERIOR OF THAT HUSKY DEFENSE IN JAMES AND QUALLS.
ONE OF THE TOP OFFENSES IN THE CONFERENCE AT JUST 20 POINTS.
WEBB GOES INTO THE END ZONE AND ALMOST PICKED OFF AGAIN.
AARONGARDENHIRE WAS THERE. &gt;&gt; Rod: AND HE WAS IN THE RIGHT
SPOT. HE LOOKED LIKE THE RECEIVER ON
THIS. WATCH HIM RUN THE ROUTE, HE'S IN
POSITION TO COME UP WITH IT, BUT CAN'T HANG ON TO IT.
NOT THE BEST THROWS BY WEBB HERE IN THE SECOND HALF.
HE'S FORCED SOME THROWS, HE'S GOT A COUPLE OF PICKS.
&gt;&gt; Mark: YOU KNOW, JAKE SABATO, THE OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR FOR
CAL, TOLD US HE'D HAVE TO GET THE BALL INTO SOME TIGHT
WINDOWS. THIS TIME ELECTED TO HAND IT
OFF, AND LAIRD IS GOING TO GET IN FOR THE TOUCHDOWN.
THEY'RE GOING TO SAY HE DIDN'T GET IN.
NOW A LATE SIGNAL. &gt;&gt; Rod: THIS IS A HARD RUN.
WATCH THE WAY LAIRD FINISHES THIS, FIGHTING TO GET IN.
HE BREAKS THE PLAY THERE. THERE'S THE FOOTBALL.
THAT'S CLEARLY A TOUCHDOWN, BUT HE LOOKED LIKE HE WAS STOPPED AT
AROUND THE THREE YARD LINE BUT JUST KEPT CHURNING AND FIGHTING
TO GET IN. THAT'S A NICE LITTLE REWARD FOR
THE SOPHOMORE. &gt;&gt; Mark: HE'S DONE A NICE JOB
WITH SEVERAL CARRIES ON THAT SCORING DRIVE.
FOUR CARRIES, 23 YARDS, AND NOW</description>

PATRICK McKARI. &gt;&gt; Rod: YEAH, HIS RIGHT LEG.
GOOD TO SEE HIM WALKING OFF THE FIELD WITH ASSISTANCE.
&gt;&gt; Mark: LOOKED LIKE THEY JUST CHANGED THE PENALTY TO BRANDON
BEAVER, NUMBER NINE. IT WASN'T NUMBER 15.
IT WAS BRANDON BEAVER. THERE HE IS, NUMBER NINE FOR THE
HUSKIES. MAY BE ANOTHER TEACHING MOMENT
FOR COACH PETERSON AND A CHANCE FOR HIM TO -- AND HIS STAFF, ONE
OF HIS STAFF MEMBERS TO PUT A PLAYER, LEADING BY 39.
HERE'S THE SCREEN FOR LAIRD, AND LAIRD BROUGHT DOWN AFTER A GAIN
OF TWO ON THE PLAY BY BROOKHAVEN WHERE KIRVIN HAD THE
INTERCEPTION. UNDER 12 MINUTES TO GO. WASHINGTON IN CONTROL.
YOU START TALKING ABOUT CAL, FOUR WINS, DIVISION LEAD OUT OF
THEIR REACH, AND IT BECOMES AN ARGUMENT OF BOWL ELIGIBILITY OR
NOT. THAT PASS COMPLETE THE BRAN DIN
SINGLETON. &gt;&gt; Rod: THEY STILL HAVE A SHOT,
AND THE WAY THEY CAN SCORE OFFENSIVELY, THEY STILL HAVE A
CHANCE TO GET THERE. THEY HAVE WASHINGTON STATE NEXT
WEEK AND FINISH WITHSTAND FORWARD AND UCL, BOTH OF WHICH
HAVE STRUGGLED TO SCORE. YOU LOOK AT THOSE, AND YOU WOULD
THINK THE LATTER TWO, THEIR BEST CHANCE OF SCORING.
&gt;&gt; Mark: WEBB TRYING TO MAKE LEMONADE HERE, COMPLETE A PASS
AT THE 15-YARD LINE TO WORSTELL. &gt;&gt; Rod: THIS WAS A SEASON COMING
INTO IT I THINK SUNNY DIKES FELT HE HAD A TEAM THAT COULD GET TO
POST SEASON, AND AFTER THEY WERE WIPED OUT ON DEFENSIVE SIDE WITH
A NUMBER OF INJURIES AND ON THE BACK END AT THE SAFETY SPOT AND
THE CORNER, THINK HE STARTED GETTING CONCERNED THAT GETTING
TO POST SEASON MIGHT BE A CHALLENGE.
&gt;&gt; Mark: SECOND AND SEVEN. LAIRD AGAIN.
GOT TO THE EDGE AND IS TACKLED RIGHT AROUND THE 10-YARD LINE --
PARDON ME, THE FIVE-YARD LINE BY THE DEFENSE STILL IN HEAVY
PURSUIT. AN EIGHT YARD GAIN ON THE PLAY.
IS BLOCKED BY COCHRAN OUT THERE. WITH SOME GOOD SIZE ON THE
INTERIOR OF THAT HUSKY DEFENSE IN JAMES AND QUALLS.
ONE OF THE TOP OFFENSES IN THE CONFERENCE AT JUST 20 POINTS.
WEBB GOES INTO THE END ZONE AND ALMOST PICKED OFF AGAIN.
AARONGARDENHIRE WAS THERE. &gt;&gt; Rod: AND HE WAS IN THE RIGHT
SPOT. HE LOOKED LIKE THE RECEIVER ON
THIS. WATCH HIM RUN THE ROUTE, HE'S IN
POSITION TO COME UP WITH IT, BUT CAN'T HANG ON TO IT.
NOT THE BEST THROWS BY WEBB HERE IN THE SECOND HALF.
HE'S FORCED SOME THROWS, HE'S GOT A COUPLE OF PICKS.
&gt;&gt; Mark: YOU KNOW, JAKE SABATO, THE OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR FOR
CAL, TOLD US HE'D HAVE TO GET THE BALL INTO SOME TIGHT
WINDOWS. THIS TIME ELECTED TO HAND IT
OFF, AND LAIRD IS GOING TO GET IN FOR THE TOUCHDOWN.
THEY'RE GOING TO SAY HE DIDN'T GET IN.
NOW A LATE SIGNAL. &gt;&gt; Rod: THIS IS A HARD RUN.
WATCH THE WAY LAIRD FINISHES THIS, FIGHTING TO GET IN.
HE BREAKS THE PLAY THERE. THERE'S THE FOOTBALL.
THAT'S CLEARLY A TOUCHDOWN, BUT HE LOOKED LIKE HE WAS STOPPED AT
AROUND THE THREE YARD LINE BUT JUST KEPT CHURNING AND FIGHTING
TO GET IN. THAT'S A NICE LITTLE REWARD FOR
THE SOPHOMORE. &gt;&gt; Mark: HE'S DONE A NICE JOB
WITH SEVERAL CARRIES ON THAT SCORING DRIVE.
FOUR CARRIES, 23 YARDS, AND NOW</description>

&gt;&gt;&gt; ESPN COLLEGE FOOTBALL IS PRESENT BY GEICO.
15 MINUTES COULD SAVE YOU 15% OR MORE ON CAR INSURANCE.
AND IN PART BY LEXUS. &gt;&gt; Mark: AND WELCOME BACK,
EVERYONE. THE BAY AREA AGLOW AT NIGHT.
A LOOK AT THE BAY BRIDGE THERE AND I'M NOT SURE THERE'S TRAFFIC
ON THE BRIDGE AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT.
OF COURSE, OUR MAN ROD GILMORE HAS THE SHORT CUTS AROUND THE
CITY. &gt;&gt; Mark: 59-27, AND HUSKIES HAVE
BEEN IN THE HIGH RENT DISTRICT IN THE PAC-12 THIS YEAR.
PERFECT ON THE SEASON COMING IN, 8-0.
AND THE QUARTERBACK JAKE BROWNING, A SOPHOMORE, DOING A
GREAT JOB. ONE OF THE FEW MISCUES TONIGHT
BY THE HUSKIES, BUT THEY RECOVER IT.
WHAT A NIGHT BY BROWNING THOUGH. &gt;&gt; Rod: HE'S BEEN FANTASTIC.
HE HAS SIX TOUCHDOWNS ON THE NIGHT.
FOUND ROSS FOR THREE OF THEM, A COUPLE REAL DEEP, ONE SHORT, AND
THEN HE CAME BACK AND STARTED TO SHARE IT WITH PETTIS.
PETTIS WITH A COUPLE OVER THE MIDDLE AND ONE DOWN THE SIDE
LINE. SIX BIG SCORES.
YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN THE MOST
FOR THE DAY. LAMAR JACKSON CAME UP WITH
SEVEN, BUT SIX ISN'T BAD. THAT'S THE SECOND TIME THIS YEAR
BROWNING HAS GONE FOR SIX TDs IN A BALL GAME.
THE ONLY QUARTERBACK IN THE FBS TO DO THAT, AND I HAS A
WELL-DESERVED BREAK NOW. &gt;&gt; Mark: CARTER SAMUELS IN THE
BALL. SARATOGA, CALIFORNIA, 6'2"
SOPHOMORE. 219 POUNDS.
PLAYED SOME LAST YEAR. SPARINGLY.
TAKE A LOOK AT HIS NUMBERS ON THE YEAR.
9 1/2 MINUTES TO GO, AND THIS ONE PRETTY MUCH ON ICE FOR THE
HUSKIES. THEY'RE IMPROPER TO 9-0 AND 6-0
IN CONFERENCE PLAY. WE'LL WAIT UNTIL TUESDAY.
IT WAS INTERESTING THAT COACH PETERSON DIDN'T SEEM TOO
CONCERNED ABOUT THEM BEING RANKED NUMBER FIVE IN THE
COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFF RANKINGS THAT CAME OUT.
COLEMAN WITH A SPIRITED RUN INTO CAL TERRITORY, AN 18-YARD GAIN.
ROD, WHAT IS IT LIKE? I MEAN IF A COACH SAYS ONE
THING, BUT FOR THESE 19 AND 18 AND 20-YEAR-OLDS REALLY SHUT IT
OUT AS MUCH AS HE THINKS? &gt;&gt; Rod: ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
I MEAN THEY'VE GOT THEIR PHONES, THEY'VE GOT THEIR FRIENDS, THEY
HAVE THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS. THEY'RE HEARING ABOUT ALL OF
THIS STUFF. THEY'RE WATCHING THESE SHOWS
AND, THEY SAY, YEAH, RIGHT, COACH, BUT THEN THEY LEAVE THE
FACILITY. THEY'RE AT DORMS, APARTMENTS,
THEY'RE HANGING OUT. OF COURSE THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT
THIS STUFF. THEY WILL BE AS INTERESTED
TUESDAY NIGHT AS ANY FAN OUT THERE AS TO WHETHER THEIR
SETTING AT NUMBER FIVE OR NUMBER FOUR.
I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE SITTING AT NUMBER FIVE.
&gt;&gt; Mark: YOU THINK THEY STILL COULD, HUH?
&gt;&gt; Rod: YEAH, I DO. &gt;&gt; Mark: THIS IS COLEMAN AGAIN.
COLEMAN IS GOING TO HOUSE IT, LATE IN THE GAME.
ANOTHER HUSKY TOUCHDOWN. LAVON COLEMAN, 49 YARDS.
ROSS ON THE SIDE LINE SAYING, NOW, HERE IS HOW IT WORK.
&gt;&gt; Rod: OH, WELL, HOW IT WORKS, HE JUST CRUSHED THEM.
I MEAN HE'S THEIR INSIDE RUNNER. HE'S ABOUT BIGGEST RUNNING BACK
THEY HAVE AT 225 POUNDS, AND HE WAS WORKING HARD TO GET TO THE
EDGE AND GET GOING THERE AND GOT HIMSELF A TOUCHDOWN.
THAT'S A NIGHT 49-YARD RUN. STYLE POINTS, BABY.
STYLE POINTS. &gt;&gt; Mark: 66 POINTS ON THE BOARD
FOR THE WASHINGTON HUSKIES. 66 POINTS.
THOSE ARE OFFENSIVE NUMBERS THAT</description>

ANOTHER TOUCHDOWN BY LAVON COLEMAN, MAKING IT 66-27.
RIGHT NOW IT IS ALL ABOUT TUESDAY AND COLLEGE FOOTBALL
PLAYOFF RANKINGS THAT WILL COME OUT.
EXCLUSIVELY REVEALED HE ON ESPN TUESDAY NIGHT.
WATSON ON THE RETURN. ROD, TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK THE
COMMITTEE WILL COME UP WITH ON TUESDAY.
&gt;&gt; Rod: SURE. I THINK WHAT THE COMMITTEE WILL
DO SINCE THEY GAVE US A LEANING IS THEY WILL MOVE OHIO STATE
INTO NUMBER FOUR, AND THAT'S BECAUSE THEY PUT A &amp; M AT FOUR
LAST WEEK AND THEY CITED THE FACT THAT THEY LOOKED AT
NON-CONFERENCE SCHEDULE AND WINS AGAINST RANKED TEAMS AND THE
LIKE. AND YOU CAN SUBSTITUTE OHIO
STATE FOR A &amp; M AND GET TO THE SAME PLACE.
&gt;&gt; Mark: INTERESTING. McGARY ON THE RUN.
PEOPLE GOING TO COUNTER AND SAY OHIO STATE LOST TO AN UNRANKED
PENN STATE TEAM. HOW DO YOU RECONCILE THAT.
&gt;&gt; Rod: THAT'S A PENN STATE THE COMMITTEE HAD AT 12, AND YOU
HAVE THREE WINS AGAINST RANKED TEAMS, ONE LOSS.
YOU HAVE A NON-CONFERENCE GAME AGAINST OKLAHOMA WHICH
WASHINGTON CAN'T MATCH WITH</description>

      <description>DEFENSE.
JOE MATHIS ONCE AGAIN NOT PLAYING IN THIS GAME.
HIS RETURN, WE DON'T KNOW WHEN HE'S COMING BACK.
AND THEN ALSO NOT IN THIS BALL GAME SINCE THE SECOND QUARTER,
HE'S DONE FOR THIS GAME. SITTING WITH ICE ON HIS
SHOULDER. UNDISCLOSED INJURY.
&gt;&gt; Mark: WATSON GETS DRILLED AT THE 25 YARD LINE, A GAIN OF
SEVEN ON THE PLAY. &gt;&gt; Rod: A GOOD CATCH BY Q.
THOSE TWO GUYS HE MENTIONED, MATHIS AND WOOCHING, THOSE ARE
THE GUYS THAT HAVE BRING IT. THEY NEED OUTSIDE PRESSURE.
RIGHT NOW THEY'RE DEPENDING ON THE BIG FELLOWS TO GENERATE THE
PRESSURE. &gt;&gt; Mark: WEBB GOING UP TOP.
HE IS PICKED OFF BY JONES. HE WENT IN JONES' NEIGHBORHOOD
ONE TIME TOO MANY. WHY IS THE OFFICIAL KEEPING
JONES AWAY FROM THE BALL. &gt;&gt; Rod: IT WAS A BAD THROW, POOR
DECISION BY WEBB. YOU HAVE NO KNOW WHERE YOU'RE
GOING WITH THE FOOTBALL AND WHO IS OPEN, WHO IS NOT.
THAT'S JONES, HE IS TH GUY THEY TRIED TO STAY AWAY FROM.
HE IS THE GUY MOST TEAMS TRIED TO STAY AWAY FROM.
LOOK WHERE THE BALL WAS THROWN. THAT BALL IS A FADE ROUTE.
IT HAS TO BE BACK TOWARDS THE END ZONE, TOWARDS THE BASKET TO
DROP IT IN. IT HAS TO BE OVER HIS HEAD.
IT CAN'T BE INSIDE. CAN'T LEAVE HIM THERE.
&gt;&gt; Mark: ROD, THAT WAS THE SECOND INTERCEPTION OF THE
SEASON FOR JONES. &gt;&gt; Rod: WELL, AND IT TAKES AWAY
A SCORING OPPORTUNITY FOR CAL. &gt;&gt; Mark: YOU KNOW, YOU SAID
EARLIER TONIGHT THAT THOSE TWO DBs, JONES AND KING, MIGHT BE
THE BEST PAIR OF CORNERBACKS IN THE COUNTRY.
SHOWING SOME SKILL ON THAT ONE. FIRST AND TEN, HUSKIES.
COLEMAN IN THE BACK FIELD. COLEMAN ON THE HAND OFF.
GASH THAT DEFENSIVE FRONT, AND COLEMAN STAYS ON HIS FEET,
UNREMITTING AND UNRELENTING, ALL THE WAY INTO CAL TERRITORY.
RUBENZER FINALLY WITH A TACKLE ON THE 33 YARD GAIN.
&gt;&gt; Rod: I COUNTED 17 YARDS AFTER CONTACT.
THIS IS POOR TACKLING, THIS IS HARD RUNNING.
LOOK HOW FAR HE CARRIES THAT CAL DEFENSE.
&gt;&gt; Mark: YEAH, ALMOST 20. &gt;&gt; Rod: OH, MAN.
&gt;&gt; Mark: COLEMAN AND GASKIN, A NICE TANDEM IN THAT WASHINGTON
BACK FIELD. LOOK AT THE RUSH YARDS
DIFFERENTIAL TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; Rod: LOOK HOW MUCH ROOM
THEY'RE GIVING ROSS OUT THERE. &gt;&gt; Mark: ROSS SLID TO THE BOTTOM
OF THE SCREEN. GOING HIS WAY.
HE'S GOT HIM. CAUGHT AT THE 12.
AND HE RAN OUT OF REAL ESTATE OR ELSE HE WOULD HAVE HAD A
TOUCHDOWN. &gt;&gt; Rod: THEY GAVE HIM A LOT --
LOOK AT THAT CUSHION. BUT YOU'VE GOT TO TURN YOUR HIPS
AND GO. YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T RUN WITH HIM,
HE'S BEEN RUNNING BY YOU ALL NIGHT.
JUST CAN'T GIVE HIM TEN YARDS. YOU'VE GOT TO TURN AND GO, AND
HE STILL RAN BY HIM. HAD THAT BALL BEEN A LITTLE
MORIN SIDE, HE'S DANCING IN THE END ZONE.
WHAT A NIGHT FOR ROSS. &gt;&gt; Mark: WELL, SURNAME IS ROSS
III. THAT THREE STANDS FOR THE THREE
TOUCHDOWNS HE HAS TONIGHT. FIRST AND GOAL.
AND NOWHERE TO GO THIS TIME FOR COLEMAN.
STRING IT OUT WELL. GONNA BE A LITTLE LOSS ON THE
PLAY. JOHN ROSS CAME INTO THE BALL
GAME WITH 38 CATCHES, 11 TOUCHDOWNS.
THOSE 11 TOUCHDOWNS WERE TIED FOR THE LEAD IN THE COUNTRY.
&gt;&gt; Rod: 83% IN THE RED ZONE IS EXCELLENT.
REMEMBER, YOU WANT TO BE OVER 70%.
THEY'RE WAY OVER 70%. &gt;&gt; Mark: BROWNING UNDER PRESSURE
THIS TIME. INCOMPLETE, AND A FLAG THROWN.
DREW SAMPLE WAS BEING DEFENDED BY HAWKING.
AND THERE HAS BEEN NO RELIEF TONIGHT FOR THAT BEAR'S
SECONDARY. &gt;&gt; Rod: WELL, THIS PERFORMANCE
BY BROWNING -- &gt;&gt; Referee: PASS INTERFERENCE,
DEFENSE, NUMBER SIX. BALL WILL BE PLACED AT THE TWO
YARD LINE. AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN.
&gt;&gt; Rod: PLAYER DOWN FOR CAL. BROWNING WITH THIS PERFORMANCE,
FOUR TOUCHDOWN PASSES, I THINK THAT'S GOING TO KEEP HIM IN THAT
HEISMAN RACE. I AM ONE OF THE VOTERS IN THE
HEISMAN TROPHY AND, YOU KNOW, NOVEMBER IS WHEN YOU REALLY
START PAYING ATTENTION TO PERFORMANCES.
&gt;&gt; Mark: RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Rod: AND IN PARTICULAR IN BIG
GAMES, HOW YOU PLAY IN THOSE GAMES.
&gt;&gt; Mark: WHAT ABOUT LAMAR JACKSON TODAY?
&gt;&gt; Rod: WELL, HE'S JUST RIDICULOUS.
RESPONSIBLE FOR SEVEN TOUCHDOWNS TODAY.
HE IS CLEARLY, I'D SAY, THE LEAD DOG FOR MOST VOTERS.
AND THE WAY HE'S PERFORMING REALLY HURTS A GUY LIKE BROWNING
BECAUSE BROWNING'S NUMBERS WON'T GET TO THE SAME LEVEL AS
JACKSON'S, 15 OF 22, 319, FIVE TDs.
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD, BUT JACKSON WENT FOR 17 RESPONSIBLE FOR.
&gt;&gt; Mark: YEAH. ON THE BALL, GASKIN WILL SCORE.
HITS THE TURBO JETS AND IT WAS OVER.
AND THE HUSKY BAND IS PLAYING AGAIN.
&gt;&gt; Rod: THE LEFT SIDE OF THAT LINE CHOPPED DOWN A BUNCH OF CAL
BLOCKERS AND GASKIN SAID, HEY, NO ONE FROM THE INSIDE HAS THE
SPEED TO CATCH ME ON THE EDGE. &gt;&gt; Mark: THAT'S HIS EIGHTH
RUSHING TOUCHDOWN OF THE SEASON AND THE 22nd OF HIS CAREER.
AND IT IS A 49-20 LEAD FOR THE HUSKIES.
PAC-12 AFTER DARK, COMMITTEE MEMBERS, HOPE YOU'RE UP AND
WATCHING.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt; Mark: THAT'S A GREAT SKILL TO
HAVE, TOO. I'M SURE IT SERVES HIM WELL AND,
YOU KNOW, IT CAN BE A REAL HELPFUL THING.
THIS IS WHAT QUINT DREW. &gt;&gt; Rod: YEAH.
&gt;&gt; Mark: ACTUALLY, THIS IS WHAT QUINT DRAW.
Q, DIDN'T WANT TO PUT YOU ON -- DIDN'T WANT TO LIE TO THE
PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; Quint: IT IS A LOG CABIN,
IMPRESSIONIST.  IT LOOKS TO BE AN
INTERCEPTION. &gt;&gt; Mark: ANOTHER ONE TONIGHT BY
JONES, QUINT. THEY MIGHT WANT TO DRAW THAT
BECAUSE HE'S AN ARTIST IN THE SECONDARY TONIGHT.
&gt;&gt; Quint: WE'VE TOLD YOU BE CAREFUL ROWING TOWARDS NUMBER
26. MOST FOLKS STAYED AWAY, AND THAT
WAS A LATE THROW OVER THE MIDDLE.
YOU SAW WEBB TRYING TO GET THE BALL TO WARDEN, AND JONES HAD
HIM COMPLETELY COVERED AND ACTED LIKE A RECEIVER AND STEPPED IN
FRONT. SO THAT THROW HAS TO BE ON TIME.
&gt;&gt; Mark: DAVIS WEBB FACING A COUPLE OF GREAT CORNERS TONIGHT.
SECOND PICK OF THE NIGHT FOR JONES.
ABOUT EIGHT AND A HALF MINUTES TO GO IN THE THIRS QUARTER.
THE FIRST DOWN OUT TO THE 47 YARD LINE.
VANDERBILT WITH A NICE STICK, AND A THIRD YARD GAIN ON THE
PLAY. THERE'S A FLAG ON THE PLAY.
WE WILL SEE IF IT STANDS OR NOT. &gt;&gt; Referee: AFTER THE PLAY WAS
OVER, PERSONAL FOUL, NUMBER NINE ON THE DEFENSE.
15-YARD PENALTY WILL BE ADDED TO THE END OF THE RUN.
FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; Mark: AGAINST JAMES LOONEY.
&gt;&gt; Rod: JONESY, REMEMBER THAT WHEN BROWNING WAS IN HIGH
SCHOOL, NOT TOO FAR AWAY FROM HER, ABOUT 75 MINUTES, AN HOUR
AWAY, NEAR SACRAMENTO, HE SET THE NATIONAL RECORD WITH 229
CAREER TOUCHDOWN PASSES IN THREE YEARS OF HIGH SCHOOL.
&gt;&gt; Mark: WOW. &gt;&gt; Rod: HE PLAYED FOR TROY
DAVIS, THE QUARTERBACK HERE AT CAL, AND WAS ON CAL'S RUE
CRETING RADAR BUT APPARENTLY NOT A FAVORITE ON THE RADAR.
&gt;&gt; Mark: A REAL INEXACT SCIENCE AND HE IS CERTAINLY BLOT ONLYING
UNDER THE HUSKIES COACHING STAFF.
OUT OF BOUNDS AT THE 32. FIVE-YARD GAIN ON THE PLAY.
&gt;&gt; Rod: REMBER, DAVIS WEBB TRANSFERRED IN AFTER JARRETT
GOFF WENT PROCEED. BROWNING WOULD HAVE FIT
PERFECTLY INTO THE CAL SYSTEM AS A GUY THAT WOULD BE READY RIGHT
NOW, AS A SOPHOMORE, AS A JUNIOR.
BUT, INSTEAD, HE KIND OF FELL IN LOVE WITH CHRIS PETERSON WHO WAS
AT BOISE STATE WHEN THEY MET, AND WHEN PETERSON WENT TO
WASHINGTON BROWNING FOLLOWED HIM.
&gt;&gt; Mark: HE HAD ATTENDED PETERSON'S CAMPS AT BOISE STATE.
SECOND AND FIVE. BROWNING.
GOING UP WITH PETTIS. ROOM SERVICE.
TOUCHDOWN HUSKIES. AND THE ROUTE IS ON IN EARNEST.
&gt;&gt; Rod: THIS IS SO EASY, PETTIS IS OPEN BY FOUR YARDS, AND
BROWNING RECOGNIZED RIGHT AWAY WHERE HE WANTED TO GO WITH THE
FOOTBALL. &gt;&gt; Mark: BROWNING WITH HIS SIXTH
TOUCHDOWN PASS OF THE NIGHT. THAT'S A SCHOOL RECORD, AND THE
34th TOUCHDOWN PASS OF THE SEASON.
AND THE METER IS STILL RUNNING, FOLKS, AND IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
IT IS GOING TO STOP ANY TIME SOON.
&gt;&gt; Rod: STYLE POINTS.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt; Mark: W
&gt;&gt; Mark: WELCOME BACK, EVERYONE, TO MEMORIAL STADIUM IN BERKLEY,
CALIFORNIA. PETTIS WITH HIS SECOND TOUCHDOWN
RECEPTION A MOMENT AGO. SON OF GARY PETTIS, FORMER MAJOR
LEAGUE BASEBALL PLAYER. AND BROWNING WITH A SCHOOL
RECORD SIX TOUCHDOWN PASSES, AND THE HUSKIES LEADING BY 36.
&gt;&gt; Rod: DON'T THINK WE AREN'T IN THE ERA OF STYLE POINTS.
&gt;&gt; Mark: ANOTHER SHORT KICKOFF, COMES DOWN AT THE 25.
WELL, OUR WEEK NINE MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL MATCHUP FEATURES TYROD
TAYLOR AND THE BILLS FACING RUSSELL WILSON AND THE SEAHAWKS
IN SEATTLE. 8:00 P.M. EASTERN, BEGINS WITH
MONDAY NIGHT COUNTDOWN AT 6:00, ALSO STREAMING LIVE ON
WATCHESPN. &gt;&gt; Rod: STYLE POINTS, 56 HERE.
DID YOU SEE WHAT OHIO STATE DID TO NEBRASKA?
&gt;&gt; Mark: WHAT WAS THE FINAL, HOW BAD DID IT GET?
&gt;&gt; Rod I THINK IT WAS THE WORSE LOSS BY A TOP TEAM.
&gt;&gt; Mark: I MISSPOKE. IT WAS PETTIS'S THIRD TOUCHDOWN
OF THE NIGHT. &gt;&gt; Rod: OHIO STATE 62, NEBRASKA
THREE. &gt;&gt; Mark: I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH COACHES, QUOTE, UNQUOTE, RUNNING THE SCORE UP.
I REMEMBER MY FRESHMAN YEAR PLAYING BALL, I --
&gt;&gt; Rod: YOU RAN IT UP. &gt;&gt; Mark: I DIDN'T GET A LOT OF
RUN, I WANTED TO SCORE WHEN I WAS IN.
I PRACTICED HARD ALL WEEK, I SHOULD GET A CHANCE TO PLAY HARD
AND SCORE TOO, NOT JUST GO OUT AND LAY DOWN FOR SOMEBODY THAT'S
NOT AS GOOD. TRE WATSON ON THE RUN.
PEOPLE SHOULDN'T PLAY SPORTS IF THEY DON'T WANT TO GET THEIR
FEELINGS HURT. &gt;&gt; Rod: THE OTHER TEAM HAS A
RESPONSIBILITY TO STOP THEM. &gt;&gt; Mark: THANK YOU.
&gt;&gt; Rod: I HEAR YOU. THERE'S A POINT WHERE
SPORTSMANSHIP COMES IN, LIKE IF YOU'RE PLAYING A FOOTBALL GAME
AND UP 62-3 IN THE FOURTH QUARTER AND YOU ARE THROWING THE
FOOTBALL, YOU SHOULDN'T BE THROWING IT, YOU SHOULD RUN IT.
&gt;&gt; Mark: WHAT IF YOU ARE A RECEIVER, ISN'T IT UNFAIR?
&gt;&gt; Rod: NO, MAKE YOURSELF A FIRST ORR SECOND STRING PLAYER
AND PLAY WHEN IT MATTERS. &gt;&gt; Mark: OH, MAN.
WE'LL TAKE THAT ONE UP LATER AFTER THE GAME.
JONES TOOK THAT ONE OUT OF BOUNDS.
DAVIS WEBB IS HAVING A REAL HARD NIGHT.
&gt;&gt; Rod: YEAH, AND A LOT OF QUARTERBACKS HAVE WHEN THEY FACE
THIS DEFENSE. YOU KNOW, AT ONE POINT I HEARD
PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THIS DEFENSE PERHAPS BEING AS GOOD AS
THE HUSKIES' 1991 DEFENSE. I WOULDN'T GO THAT FAR.
THIS TEAM COULD VERY WELL WIND UP UNDEFEATED FOR THE HUSKIES,
BUT THAT '91 TEAM WAS RIDICULOUS.
CO-NATIONAL CHAMP, 12-0, BEAT MICHIGAN AND DESMOND HOWARD IN
THE ROSE BALL. &gt;&gt; Mark: THAT WAS STEVE, RIGHT?
&gt;&gt; Rod: YEAH. &gt;&gt; Mark: A LOW LINE DRIVE PUNT.
TTIS WATCHES IT BOUNCE INSIDE THE TEN, AND THE BEARS GOING TO
DO A GOOD JOB HERE KEEPING IT OUT OF THE END ZONE.
AND THEY'RE GOING TO DOWN IT AT THE ONE YARD LINE.
SO A NICE JOB ON THE 59 YARD PUNT.
&gt;&gt; Quint: WE WERE ALLUDING TO THE CO-NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP
YEAR OF 1991, DEFENDING OUR GUY DEZ IN THE ROSE BOWL.
BOY, HOLDING SEVEN OPPONENTS TO SEVEN POINTS OR FEWER IS QUITE A
FETE. &gt;&gt; Rod: THEY HAD THE PLAYER OF
THE YEAR IN THE PAC-12 AND MARIO BAILEY, WHO WAS THE OFFENSIVE
PLAYER OF THE YEAR IN THE PAC-12.
11 PLAYERS WERE DRAFTED INCLUDING OUR BUDDY ED
CUNNINGHAM WHO WORKS AT ESPN AND WAS ON THAT TEAM.
THEY WERE RIDICULOUS. THEIR DEFENSE HELD TEAMS TO AN
AVERAGE OF 9 1/2 POINTS A GAME. &gt;&gt; Mark: WOW.
461 POINTS THEY SCORED WERE MOST IN THE MODERN ERA OF UW FBL.
&gt;&gt; Rod: 11 DRAFT PICKS, WAS NUMBER ONE OVERALL.
THEY HAD DANA HALL AND DEMARCO FAR.
WHO ELSE CAN I REMEMBER? THEY HAD A BUNCH.
MARK BRUNELL WAS SHARING TIME WITH BILLIE JOE HOBARD.
&gt;&gt; Mark: U-DUB HAS ALWAYS HAD A GREAT RECRUITING PIPELINE INTO
CALIFORNIA, CORRECT? &gt;&gt; Rod: YEAH.
YOU KNOW, WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT BROWNING AND, YOU KNOW, HE
IS A GUY IN THE BAY AREA THAT WASHINGTON CAME DOWN AND STOLE.
&gt;&gt; Mark: GASKIN. A GAIN OF ABOUT THREE ON THE
PLAY WITH 5 1/2 MINUTES TO GO IN THE THIRD QUARTER.
THE HUSKIES WITH THEIR DESIGNS ON MOVING UP INTO THE TOP FOUR
IN THE COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFFS, YOU WILL FIND OUT ON
TUESDAY NIGHT AS THEY REVEAL AGAIN ON ESPN FOR THE SECOND
WEEK. &gt;&gt; I THINK THE COMMITTEE IS
IMPACTED BY STYLE POINTS. YOU KNOW, WE SAW THAT WHEN OHIO
STATE HAD THAT BIG CHAMPIONSHIP WIN, IN THEIR BIG TEN
CHAMPIONSHIP GAME. LOOK AT NOW AND 56 HERE TONIGHT,
OHIO WINS FOR 62. I THINK THAT MATTERS.
&gt;&gt; Mark: BROWNING, COMPLETE. ACTUALLY INCOMPLETE TO ROSS.
YOU GET SPOILED BY HIS TRANSCEND ANSWER TONIGHT.
HE DROPPED ONE. &gt;&gt; Rod: HE HAS HAD A ,
&gt;&gt; Mark: ARE YOU TELLING ME STYLE POINTS, IS THAT A
EUPHEMISM FOR RUNNING THE SCORE UP?
&gt;&gt; Rod: IT IS RUNNING IT UP. LET ME ASK YOU THIS, DO YOU
THINK IT IS A COINCIDENCE THAT THE RANKING CAME OUT AND THIS IS
FIRST WEEK OF GAMES, AND YOU HAD OHIO STATE UP THERE, WASHINGTON
IS PUSHING 60. COINCIDENCE?
&gt;&gt; Mark: I'M ALL FOR IT. I'M ALL FOR IT.
ON THE RETURN FROM MIDFIELD, WHARTON.
A LOT SPEED ON THAT WASHINGT ROSTER.
TOUGH TO GO EAST WEST AGAINST THOSE GUYS.
THEY MAKE THE TACKLE ON WHARTON. &gt;&gt; Rod: WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE
RANKINGS COMING OUT NEXT TUESDAY, THERE IS ONE TEAM THAT
WE'VE LEFT OUT AS A POSSIBLE THREAT TO EVERYONE ABOVE THEM.
AUBURN. A TWO-LOSS TEAM THAT NOW BECAUSE
A &amp; M LOST, THEY CONTROL THEIR OWN DESTINY.
IF AUBURN WINS OUT, THEY COULD KEEP --
&gt;&gt; Mark: THAT PASS COMPLETE. THAT'S AN INTERESTING SCENARIO
YOU BRING UP. AUBURN HAS GONE ON A NICE
WINNING STREAK. WE SAW THEM EARLIER THIS YEAR IN
PERSON AGAINST LSU IN A GAME WHERE THERE WAS CHATTER THAT GUS
MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN A LITTLE BIT OF TROUBLE.
&gt;&gt; Rod: YEAH. &gt;&gt; Mark: THEY'VE SINCE REALLY
TURNED THEIR SEASON AROUND. SECOND AND ONE.
MUHAMMAD. TACKLED AT THE 23.
&gt;&gt; Rod: HE MADE A LOT OF THAT ON HIS OWN.
I MEAN THAT WAS A GOOD MOVE BY MUHAMMAD TO GET TO THE OUTSIDE.
THAT RUN WAS DESIGNED TO GO INSIDE.
HE BOUNCED IT AND PICKED UP THE FIRST DOWN.
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU TALK ABOUT -- I'M NOT SAYING
AUBURN IS GOING TO BEAT ALABAMA, BUT THEORETICALLY IF THEY DID
AND FINISHED 10, 11 AND 2. &gt;&gt; Mark: INTERESTING.
INTERESTING SCENARIO. TACKLE MADE BY GREG GAINES THAT
TIME. &gt;&gt; Rod: CAN YOU IMAGINE IF
AUBURN WITH TWO LOSSES WON THE SEC AND THE COMMITTEE LEFT THEM
OUT? THE SOUTH WOULD SECEDE FROM THE
COUNTRY, SERIOUSLY. &gt;&gt; Mark: YEAH.
&gt;&gt; Rod: CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT? &gt;&gt; Mark: WE WOULD HAVE SOMETHING
BIGGER THAN POTENTIAL ELECTION NIGHT ISSUES.
THAT WOULD BE A REAL PROBLEM. SECOND AND TEN.
BUG RIVERA ON THE SWEEP, NOWHERE TO GO.
LIKE I SAID, IT IS TOUGH TO GO EAST-WEST BY THESE GUYS.
BROUGHT DOWN BY O'BRIEN, NUMBER 29.
&gt;&gt; Rod: WHAT A SMART PLAY BY RIVERA.
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A REVERSE AND HE WAS SUPPOSED TO GIVE THIS
FOOTBALL UP. WATCH HIM.
HE RECOGNIZES THAT KING IS THERE AND DISRUPTS THE PLAY, AND HE
NEVER GIVES THAT FOOTBALL UP. LOOK AT THIS.
KING IS RIGHT THERE SO HE HANGS ON TO IT.
THAT'S A SMART PLAY. &gt;&gt; Mark: KING WAS READY TO TAKE
IT AWAY ON THE HAND-OFF. THIRD AND 12.
THIS WASHINGTON DEFENSE HOLDING THE SECOND BEST OFFENSE IN THE
PAC-12 TO JUST 20 POINTS SO FAR. WEBB.
INCOMPLETE. INTENDED FOR ROBERTSON.
LIKE TO DRAW UP A TOUCHDOWN CATCH.
THE ARTIST/WIDE RECEIVER. &gt;&gt; Rod: A LITTLE BIT OF MUTUAL
COMBAT, A LITTLE HAND FIGHTING BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM, NOT
PASS INTERFERENCE. THAT'S ALLOWED.
COULDN'T QUITE COM UP WITH IT. HAD A CHANCE.
&gt;&gt; Mark: FOURTH DOWN, THEY'RE GOING TO GO FOR IT.
NO SURPRISE HERE. ABOUT 2 1/2 MINUTES TO GO IN THE
THIRD QUARTER. WEBB, PICKED OFF FOR THE THIRD
TIME TONIGHT. KNOCKED OUT OF BOUNDS AT THE 37.
SO JONES HAS TWO INTERCEPTIONS, WITH HIS FIRST.
&gt;&gt; Rod: HE WAS SITTING THERE AND WASHINGTON DROPPED INTO
COVERAGE, AND WEBB NEVER BOTHED TO REALLY LOOK.
LOOK AT THIS. THERE ARE A BUNCH OF WHITE
SHIRTS. THEY DROP EIGHT, AND HE NEVER,
EVER LOOKED OVER THERE AND FIGURED THAT HE WAS THERE.
HE WAS SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD AND SAID, HEY, LOOK
WHAT CAME MY WAY. &gt;&gt; Mark: THANK YOU.
FIRST AND TEN FOR THE HUSKIES FROM THEIR OWN 37.
SEVENTH IN THE NATION IN SCORING DEFENSE GOING TO RUN IT,
McCLATCHER. BROUGHT DOWN NEAR THE LINE OF
SCRIMMAGE. &gt;&gt; Rod: WE TALKED ABOUT BIG
PLAYS, AND THE HUSKIES KEPT SEVEN PASSES, OVER 30 YARDS
TONIGHT. NOW, ROSS HAS DONE A LOT OF THAT
BUT PETTIS AND OTHERS STEPPED IN BUT THAT MAN HAS BEEN
RESPONSIBLE FOR DELIVERING THE FOOTBALL.
HE IS 17 OF 25, 364 AND SIX TOUCHDOWNS.
AND WE HAVEN'T GOT TO THE FOURTH QUARTER.
&gt;&gt; Mark: YEAH, IN THE HEISMAN CONVERSATION.
YOU KNOW THAT BROWNING MEANS BUSINESS.
HE HASN'T POSTED ANYTHING ON HIS TWITTER, SOCIAL MEDIA SINCE THE
START OF FOOTBALL SEASON. HE HAS GONE DARK ON THE SOCIAL
MEDIA FRONT. GASKIN RUNS IT.
&gt;&gt; Rod: THE PROBLEM WITH HIS HEISMAN CAMPAIGN IS, ONE, HE'S
IN THE WEST. AS YOU HAVE MENTIONED A COUPLE
OF TIMES TONIGHT, THERE ARE FOLKS ON THE EAST COAST WHO ARE
FALLING BACK. &gt;&gt; Mark: 1:32 ON THE CLOCKS.
&gt;&gt; Rod: A LOT OF FOLKS ON THE EAST COAST DON'T SEE YOUR GREAT
PERFORMANCES. THE OTHER PROBLEM IS LAMAR
JACKSON. &gt;&gt; Mark: THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM.
SEVEN TOUCHDOWNS TODAY. RESPONSIBLE FOR SEVEN.
THIRD AND SEVEN HERE FOR WASHINGTON.
PETTIS, WAS WIDE OPEN. THERE'S GOING TO BE A FLAG
THROWN. DB MAKING CONTACT WITH HIM.
THAT WAS BECK. &gt;&gt; Rod: IT WASN'T JUST CONTACT.
IT WAS I'M GOING TO GRAB YOU AND TAKE THE PENALTY INSTEAD OF
GIVING UP ANOTHER TOUCHDOWN PASS.
&gt;&gt; Mark: LOOKED LIKE NECESSARY HAD HIM BEATEN ON THE OUT AND
UP. &gt;&gt; Referee: PRIOR TO THE PASS,
HOLDING, DEFENSE, NUMBER 22. TEN YARD PENALTY.
AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; Rod: AND BECK WAS FORCED INTO
A BIT OF ACTION</description>

      <description>A SEASON AGO.
&gt;&gt; Rod: TALENTED. PUNT RETURN SPECIALIST.
REALLY GOOD HANDS. COMPLIMENTS TO ROSS AND THE
OTHER SIDE OF THE FIELD. &gt;&gt; Mark: GASKIN BACK IN THE BALL
FIELD IN THE BACK FIELD. A COUPLE OF FAKES.
AND UNDERNEATH. THE TIGHT END, BRUCE SAMPLE,
WITH ANOTHER FIRST DOWN. CLIPPED OUT OF BOUNDS AT ABOUT
THE 23 BY VANDERBILT, BUT THEY MOVE THE CHAINS AGAIN.
&gt;&gt; Rod: GREAT DECISION BY BROWNING HERE.
ALL OF THIS PLAY ACTION. HE WANTS ROSS DEEP, BUT LOOK AT
THE DOUBLE COVERAGE ON ROSS. HE COMES OFF AND COMES
UNDERNEATH TO FIND SAMPLES. THAT'S A GOOD, SMART DECISION,
BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE HE WANTED TO GO.
HE WANTED ROSS, BUT EVERYBODY WAS WHERE ROSS IS.
&gt;&gt; Mark: HE LITERALLY HAD A PAIR OF SECONDARIES TRIPPING OVER
THEMSELVES. &gt;&gt; Rod: AFTER WHAT HE'S DONE
TONIGHT? NO DOUBT.
&gt;&gt; Mark: 32 YARD GAIN. COLEMAN BACK IN, OVER THE
MIDDLE. McCLATCHER WITH ANOTHER FIRST
DOWN, INSIDE THE TEN. FIRST AND GOAL.
BOY, THAT IS A POROUS BACK END DEFENSIVELY FOR CAL.
17 YARD GAIN. &gt;&gt; Rod: THEY'RE PLAYING WITH A
NUMBER OF GUYS WHO HAVE EARNED THEIR STRIPES THIS SEASON.
A LOT OF INJURIES. NOT JUST AT THE SAFETY SPOT BUT
AT THE CORNER SPOT. &gt;&gt; Mark: COLEMAN IN THE BACK
FIELD. P DEEP PLAY ACTION.
ON THE CATCH, ROSS. TOUCHDOWN!
HIS THIRD OF THE NIGHT. &gt;&gt; Rod: ROSS IS DEMONSTRATING
ALL OF HIS SKILLS. YOU'VE SEEN HIM RUN BY PEOPLE.
NOW HE RUNS A GREAT ROUTE, CHANGE OF DIRECTION, AND SHOWS
YOU HIS ABILITY TO GET DOWN LOW AND CRADLE THAT BALL, KEEP IT
OFF THE GROUND. LOOK AT THAT.
HE IS PUTTING ON A SHOW TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; Mark: LEARNED A LOT OF THE
SUBTLETIES OF THE POSITION WHILE HE REHABBED FROM THAT ACL INJURY
THAT HE SUFFERED LAST YEAR, AND CAME BACK THIS YEAR, HE SAYS, AS
A MUCH MORE DETERMINED AND POLISHED RECEIVER.
ROD, HE'S REALLY SHOWING THOSE SKILLS HERE TONIGHT.
&gt;&gt; Rod: HIS QUARTERBACK IS CERTAINLY PUTTING THE BALL WHERE
HE NEEDS TO. HE LED HIM TO INSIDE DOWN LOW
RECEPTION. IT WAS NICE.
&gt;&gt; Mark: CAREER HIGH THIRD TOUCHDOWN OF THE NIGHT.
JOHN ROSS, WORKING CAL LIKE A PART TIME JOB.    WHEN YOU FREEZE SOMETHING,         IT'S FOR LATER.       BUT HOW MUCH LATER?    THERE'S NO WAY TO BE SURE!           BUT WENDY'S IS SURE
          THAT IF YOU WANT       A JUICY, DELICIOUS
      HAMBURGER, RIGHT NOW    IT SHOULD BE MADE WITH
   FRESH, NEVER-FROZEN BEEF.     UNLIKE SOME OTHER GUYS. SO THAT'S WHAT'S IN EVERY SINGLE
HAMBURGER WENDY'S SERVES.         AND THE DOUBLES.         AND THE TRIPLES.      BECAUSE, AT WENDY'S,
     FRESH NEVER GETS OLD.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; AFTER MONTHS OF CAMPAIGNING,
NOVEMBER IS FINALLY HERE. EVERY WEEK, EVERY GAME, EVERY
VOTE COUNTS. AROUND THE NATION THEY HAIL.
ALL PROMISING TO MAKE THE POST SEASON.
SEE WHO ROCKS THE VOTE FOR THE COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFFS.
&gt;&gt; JOHN ROSS OF THE HUSKIES, .
&gt;&gt; Mark: JOHN RUSS OF THE HUSKIES, THREE TOUCHDOWNS.
IS LIT TONIGHT, FOLKS. BIG TOUCHDOWN CATCH A MOMENT AGO
GIVING WASHINGTON A 28-20 LEAD. UNDEFEATED 8-0 COMING IN, 5-0 IN
CONFERENCE PLAY. NUMBER FIVE IN THE COLLEGE
FOOTBALL PLAYOFF RANKING. HUD SUN ON THE RETURN.
BROUGHT DOWN AT THE 26. LET'S MEET JOHN ROSS.
&gt;&gt; I'M JOHN ROSS. &gt;&gt; Mark: AND HE PLAYS REALLY,
REALLY WELL AND RUNS REALLY, REALLY FAST.
&gt;&gt; Rod: THAT'S THE SECOND OF HIS THREE TOUCHDOWN CATCHES, TWO IN
THE FIRST QUARTER, THIS ONE IN THE THIRD QUARTER.
HE SHOWS HE HAS SKILLS OF GOING DOWN, KEEPING THAT BALL FROM
HITTING THE GROUND. HE HAS GREAT HANDS.
FANTASTIC SPEED. GREAT BODY CONTROL.
&gt;&gt; Mark: THREE RECEPTIONS FOR 133 YARDS THE NIGHT AND THREE
TOUCHDOWNS. CATCH MADE BY HANSEN THAT TIME,
WORKING AGAINST SIDNEY JONES. ALWAYS NICE TO SEE A GUY COME
BACK FROM A MAJOR KNEE INJURY THE WAY ROSS HAS.
&gt;&gt; Rod: HE'S DONE MORE THAN COME BACK.
HE'S FASTER, BETTER. &gt;&gt; Mark: SECOND AND SEVEN.
DOWN THE FIELD AND INCOMPLETE. TRIED TO FIND HANSEN.
YOU SEE WHEN HANSEN PULLED UP THERE HE WAS FAVORING THAT
ANKLE, WORKING AGAINST SIDNEY JONES.
HE'LL GET THE NEXT PLAY OFF. &gt;&gt; Rod: THE GOOD NEWS FOR CAL IS
THAT HANSEN IS BACK. THEY'VE FOUND HIM.
THEY'RE ABLE TO USE HIM. &gt;&gt; Mark: ROBERTSON THE NEXT BEST
RECEIVER OUT THERE. PLAY CLOCK AT 10.
BLITZ COMING. WEBB JUST GOT IT OFF IN TIME.
BUT IT WAS SHORT BECAUSE HE TOOK A HIT.
AND HE FELT THAT ONE. PRESSURE COMING FROM --
&gt;&gt; Rod: WELL, WASHINGTON HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET TO WEB SO THEY
BROUGHT A BLITZ THIS TIME. THERE YOU HE WAS ABLE TO GET TO
HIM AND LAY HIM UP, A BIG HIT. &gt;&gt; Mark: THAT'S WASHINGTON FRONT
SEVEN. PRETTY GOOD FREECHLT
DIRECTIONAL -- &gt;&gt; Quint: DIRECTIONAL PUNTING IS
CRITICAL FOR CAL SO THE NUMBERS ARE OUTSIDE.
&gt;&gt; Mark: PETTIS HAD A TOUCHDOWN ON A PUNT RETURN LAST WEEK.
AND THAT SEVEN POINT WIN AGAINST UTAH, 44 YARDS ON THE PUNT,
NOTHING ON THE RETURN. AND WEBB REACHING FOR HIS RIBS A
LITTLE BIT. THAT'S GOT TO HURT.            Hey guys.</description>

      <description>             [bong] &gt;&gt; Mark: AND WELCOME BACK,
EVERYONE, TO ESPN COLLEGE FOOTBALL PRESENTED BY GEICO.
NUMBER FIVE WASHINGTON, LOOKING TO MOVE TO 9-0 ON THE SEASON,
AND PERHAPS CRACK THAT TOP FOUR. THE FIRST FOUR SPOTS IN THE
COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFF RIGHT NOW ON THE FRINGE AT NUMBER
FIVE, AS BOLLES CAME OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME, CAME O FOR THE
FIRST TIME ON TUESDAY WITH THE STANDINGS.
BROWNING GOING UP TOP. INCOMPLETE.
EVEN ROSS COULDN'T GET THAT ONE. &gt;&gt; Rod: HE IS NOW 9 OF 14 WITH
THREE TOUCHDOWN PASSES, BROWNING IS.
HE'S A GUY IN CAL'S BACKYARD COMING OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL, BUT
THE RUMOR ON THE RECRUITING TRAIL THAT CAL WASN'T BIG ON HIM
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T THINK HE WAS TALL ENOUGH.
&gt;&gt; Mark: REALLY? &gt;&gt; Rod: BUT YOU WOULD THINK THAT
GIVEN THAT HE WAS NEARBY AND PLAYED FOR A FORMER CAL
QUARTERBACK THAT CAL WOULD HAVE WRAPPED HIM UP HAD THEY WANTED
HIM. &gt;&gt; Mark: GASKIN.
GETTING A GOOD BLOCK DOWN FIELD FROM PETTIS.
AND A FLAG THROWN ON THE PLAY AS PETTIS IS PUSHED OUT OF BOUNDS
AT THE 47-YARD LINE. THIS MAY COME BACK THOUGH.
McGARY BACK THERE BY THE SITE OF THE FLAG.
&gt;&gt; Referee: HOLDING. &gt;&gt; Rod: McGARY, THE RIGHT
TACKLE. WASHINGTON GENERALLY HAS BEEN
ABLE TO RUN WHEN THEY WANTED TO. THE MIX OF THE RUSHING ATTACK
WITH JOHN ROSS GETTING BEAT BEHIND PEOPLE KEEPS WASHINGTON
FROM GETTING AN EXTRA -- KEEPS CAL FROM GETTING AN EXTRA MAN
DOWN IN THE BOX BECAUSE OF THE THREAT OF WHAT JOHN ROSS CAN DO
TO YOU. &gt;&gt; Mark: A PRETTY BALANCED
OFFENSE, THIS HUSKY TEAM. SECOND AND 16.
BROWNING. ROSS WITH THE CATCH.
AND ACROSS MIDFIELD TO THE 49 YARD LINE.
FIRST AND TEN. &gt;&gt; Rod: HERE'S THE PROBLEM.
YOU HAVE TO DOUBLE HIM. THEY NEED TO HAVE SOMEBODY OUT
THERE WHO IS AT LEAST TRYING TO REDIRECT HIM AND GET A HIT ON
HIM TO SLOW HIM DOWN, BECAUSE YOU LET HIM RUN FREE LIKE THAT,
HE IS CRUSHING THIS CAL SECONDARY.
&gt;&gt; Mark: LOOK AT THE NUMBERS ALREADY.
&gt;&gt; Rod: LOOK AT THE CUSHION YOU GIVE HIM, BUT HE GETS TO RUN
FREE LIKE THAT. YOU'VE GOT TO FIND A WAY TO
DOUBLE HIM, AND THAT MEANS THAT WASHINGTON WILL GO AWAY AND RUN
IT AGAINST YOU. &gt;&gt; Mark: FIRST AND TEN.
THE JET SWEEP TO McCLATCHER. NICE TOUCH BACK AND BROUGHT DOWN
INSIDE FIELD GOAL RANGE AT THE 25, BUT THE WAY THE HUSKIES ARE
MOVING THE FOOTBALL THEY'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT A FIELD GOAL,
THAT'S FOR SURE. &gt;&gt; Rod: AND THEY'RE NOT WORRIED
ABOUT THE CLOCK, THEY'RE GETTING CHUNKS RIGHT NOW.
AGAIN, BECAUSE OF ROSS CAL GETS OVER CONCERNED ABOUT DEALING
WITH HIM, DEALING WITH THE PASS, AND THEN THEY COME BACK AND GET
TO THE EDGE, THEY RUN I SIDE. &gt;&gt; Mark: FIRST AND TEN, UNDER
FOUR MINUTES TO GO. ROSS LINING UP TO THE TOP OF
YOUR SCREEN. COLEMAN IN THE BACK FIELD.
LOOKS TO ROSS, AND UNDER THROWN, IN COMPLETE.
&gt;&gt; Rod: DID YOU SEE BEFORE THE PLAY HE BASICALLY TURNED TO
BROWNING AND SAID, HEY, HEY, THROW IT OVER HERE.
THEY'RE SO FAR OFF OF ME, THROW ME THE BALL.
&gt;&gt; Mark: THAT WASN'T A  &gt;&gt; Rod: NO, THEY'RE STARTING TO
GET INTO A GROOVE. HE'S SAYING I KNOW WHEN I'M
SINGLED UP, JUST LOOK MY WAY. &gt;&gt; Mark: FORMER TRACK STAR FROM
LONG BEACH, CALIFORNIA. 12 ON 11 TOUCHDOWN TACKLES
COMING INTO THE GAME, THAT'S 14 NOW.
THERE'S GASKIN WITH NOWHERE TO GO.
STOPPED UP RIGHT NEAR THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE BY JAMES LOONEY.
WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO COVER SOMEBODY THAT MUCH FASTER THAN
YOU LIKE JOHN ROSS HAS, YOU TALKED ABOUT, WHAT, DOUBLE
TEAMING HIM, BRACKET? &gt;&gt; Rod: YEAH, I THINK THEY NEED
TO FIND A WAY TO REDIRECT HIM, DISRUPT HIM, GET A GUY WHO
PUSHES HIM, HITS HIM OFF THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE, AND A LITTLE
HELP OVER THE TOP. THERE HE IS WAY OUT THERE.
HE IS CHANGING THINGS UP, AND LOOK AT ALL OF THAT FIELD.
HE'S -- ALL OF THAT FIELD, ONE-ON-ONE.
THAT'S A PROBLEM. &gt;&gt; Mark: TO ROSS, AND HE WAS
HELD. &gt;&gt; Rod: YEAH.
&gt;&gt; Mark: WOW, FRANKLIN WAS HOLDING HIM LIKE A GRUDGE, AND
GOT CAUGHT WITH THE FLAG. &gt;&gt; Rod: YEAH, HE'S RUNNING THE
POST. THIS IS WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO DO.
YOU CAN'T COVER HIM, DON'T GIVE UP SIX, TAKE THE PENALTY.
&gt;&gt; Referee: NUMBERS, OKAY. &gt;&gt; Rod: FRANKLIN NO CHANCE
THERE. &gt;&gt; Referee: PASS INTERFERENCE,
NUMBER 18. AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN.
&gt;&gt; Rod: IT IS A TOUGH SPOT FOR FRANKLIN TO BE IN.
YOU'RE ASKING HIM THE PLAY SINGLE COVERAGE AND HE'S GOT
HALF THE FIELD, AGAINST A GUY WHO ALREADY HAS THREE TOUCHDOWNS
AND HE'S RUN BY EVERYBODY. &gt;&gt; Mark: YOU CAN ALMOST HEAR
JOHN ROSS OUT THERE SAYING, HEY, I GOT ONE, I GOT ONE OUT HERE.
THREE TOUCHDOWNS ALREADY IN THE FIRST HALF FOR JOHN ROSS.
MISSED ALL OF LAST SEASON WITH AN ACL INJURY TO HIS KNEE.
FIRST AND GOAL. &gt;&gt; Rod: THAT'S STILL A MATCHUP.
&gt;&gt; Mark: GASKIN POWERING HIS WAY DOWN INSIDE THE FIVE, TACKLE
WILLED BY DaVONTE DOWNS. A GAIN OF FIVE ON THE PLAY.
&gt;&gt; Rod: ART COFFMAN, THE DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR FOR CAL,
IS LOOKING AT THIS AND 83 IN THE RED ZONE IS A PROBLEM.
HE WOULD LIKE TO DOUBLE ROSS DOWN HERE, BUT WASHINGTON WOULD
LOOK AT THE NUMBERS AND RUN IT INSIDE AND RUN IT DOWN THEIR
THROATS. &gt;&gt; Mark: SECOND AND GOAL.
GASKIN SET REAL DEEP IN THE BACK FIELD.
MADE A NICE READ AND CUT. DOWN TO THE ONE YARD LINE,
BROUGHT DOWN BY CAMERON WALKER. ROD, HE WAS SET, ALMOST LOOKED
LIKE EIGHT OR NINE YARDS BEHIND THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE.
&gt;&gt; Rod: PLENTY OF ROOM FOR HIM TO SEE AND USE HIS VISION TO
FIND THE HOLE HE WANTS. HE CAN BE PATIENT.
FOR A GUY THAT'S NOT THAT BIG, HE IS A TOUGH INSIDE RUNNER.
I MEAN HE REALLY DOES RUN WITH A LOT OF TOUGHNESS WHEN YOU
WOULDN'T THINK HE COULD DO THAT GIVEN -- GIVEN HE'S ONLY ABOUT
175 POUNDS. &gt;&gt; Mark: THIRD AND GOAL.
BROWNING, AND INTO THE END ZONE. PETTIS WITH THE TOUCHDOWN!
THE HUSKY OFFENSE A WELL-OILED MACHINE.
&gt;&gt; Rod: WE SAID FIRST TO 40 MIGHT WIN THIS ONE.
WE MIGHT GET 40 IN THE FIRST HALF.
AND THAT'S JUST A QUICK OUT. PETTIS WITH A WELL-THROWN BALL.
BROWNING IS ON -- ON THE MONEY. COMPLETELY ON THE MONEY.
&gt;&gt; Mark: BROWNING, ROSS, PETTIS,  &gt;&gt; Mark: DAN DANTE PETTIS WITH
THE TOUCHDOWN TOUCH. A MUCH IMPROVED FROM LAST
SEASON. GREAT TIMING WITH HE AND JAKE
BROWNING. BROWNING ADDING TO THAT HEISMAN
RESUME WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER TODAY IN OUR PRODUCTION
MEETING, ROD. WHERE DO YOU THINK HE FIGURES IN
THE WHOLE HEISMAN HIERARCHY RIGHT NOW?
&gt;&gt; Rod: HE FELL OFF A LITTLE BIT LAST WEEK AFTER THE UTAH GAME
WITH A SUB PAR PERFORMANCE. HE NEEDS A BIG NIGHT.
FOUR TOUCHDOWN PASSES TONIGHT WILL PROBABLY KEEP HIM IN THE
RUNNING. &gt;&gt; Mark: YEAH, HE'S OFF TO A
GOOD START. &gt;&gt; Rod: A LOT OF JACKSON IN THE
HEISMAN DISCUSSION RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; Mark: ADNAN BURKE CAN TELL
YOU ABOUT IT. WHAT IS UP?
&gt;&gt; THE BMW HALFTIME REPORT, AS ALABAMA SENDING A MESSAGE TO LSU
WITH THE STAUNCH DEFENSIVE EFFORT IN BATON ROUGE.
ALSO, LAMAR JACKSON PUTTING UP MAGNIFICENT SEVEN WHEN IT COMES
TO TOUCHDOWN. OHIO STATE EMBARRASSES THAT NEBRASKA.
ALL OF THAT AT THE HALF. &gt;&gt; Mark: HE MIGHT HAVE MET HIS
MATCH ON THAT. &gt;&gt; Rod: YEAH, JOEY COULD FLY
BACK IN THE DAY. BUT JOHN ROSS --
&gt;&gt; Mark: JOEY A 4-2 GUY, LOW 4-3?
SOMEWHERE AROUND THIS. THIS IS MUHAMMAD WITH A NICE
RUN. PICKS UP A NICE DOWN, AND A
WASHING TON PLAYER SHAKEN UP ON THE 11-YARD RUN.
AT THE 39 YARD LINE, LOOKS LIKE THE AREA.
&gt;&gt; Rod: YEAH, THAT'S AN OUTSTANDING LINEBACKER.
YOU TALK ABOUT A GUY WITH GREAT SPEED AT THAT INSIDE LINE
BACKING SPOT, YOU KNOW, HE AND VICTOR AS A TANDEM REALLY CHASE
THINGS DOWN SIDE LINE TO SIDE LINE.
HE IS A TREMENDOUS PLAYER. THEY USED HIM IN PASS COVERAGE
AS WELL. &gt;&gt; Mark: WE WATCHED A LOT OF
FILM OF THIS WASHINGTON DEFENSE ON FRIDAY, ROD, AND THEY REALLY
EE PIT -- EPITOMIZE THE HYBRID GUYS.
&gt;&gt; Rod: YEAH, A GUY THAT CAN RUSH THE QUARTERBACK, CAN STOP
THE RUN AND COVER RECEIVERS 25 YARDS DOWN THE FIELD WHEN YOU
TALK ABOUT HIM. HE'S OUTSTANDING, THAT'S
BIERRIA. &gt;&gt; Mark: NOBODY HOME ON THE
OTHER END OF THAT PASS. HANSEN WATCHED IT SALE TEN YARDS
PAST HIM, AS WE APPROACH ONE MINUTE TO GO HERE IN THE FIRST
HALF. &gt;&gt; Rod: CAL LOOKING FOR A PLAY.
ANY WHAT TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING TO KEEP CONNECTED TO
WASHINGTON. THEY'VE GOT PLENTY OF TIME, BUT
THEY NEED TO COME UP WITH A COUPLE OF PLAYS HERE.
&gt;&gt; Mark: UNDERNEATH. HUDSON, BREAKING TACKLE.
WASHINGTON UNABLE TO WRAP HIM UP UNTIL HE MAKES IT OUT TO THE 44.
THIRD DOWN COMING UP, AND CAL WITH TWO TIME OUTS REMAINING, A
GAIN OF SEVEN ON THE LAST PLAY. &gt;&gt; Rod: THEY'RE LOSING A LOT OF
TIME HERE, WHICH THEY'VE GOT TWO TIME OUTS.
I WOULD HAVE BURNED ONE THERE. &gt;&gt; Mark: WEBB HANDS IT OFF TO
TRE WATSON. ALL OF THAT FOR A YARD RUN, ROD.
&gt;&gt; Rod: YEAH, THEY BURNED ABOUT 20, 25 SECONDS, AND NOW THEY'RE
LOOKING AT LIKE, YOU KNOW, WHAT THE HECK, JUST LET IT GO.
&gt;&gt; Mark: YEAH. &gt;&gt; Rod: I THINK HAD THEY GIVEN
THEMSELVES A TIME OUT AND GAVE THEMSELVES A CHANCE TO COME UP
WITH A PLAY, THEY WOULD HAVE HAD ONE TIME OUT AND ABOUT 40
SECONDS. &gt;&gt; Mark: WELL, WASHINGTON WON
HERE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO IN 2014 31-7.
NOW WITH TWO SECONDS TO GO, CAL CALLS TIME OUT.
FOURTH AND TWO. YOU KNOW, WE GO BACK A COUPLE OF
YEARS AGO AND EVEN LAST YEAR, ROD, WE'VE SEEN OUR SHARE OF
HAIL MARY'S AT THE END OF GAMES AND AT THE END OF FIRST HALVES.
SO DON'T SLEEP ON THE PAC-12 AFTER DARK, FOLKS.
&gt;&gt; Rod: 75 POINTS -- WELL, WE'LL GET TO 75.
WE HAVE 55 ALREADY. WE WERE TALKING BEFORE THE GAME
ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WHO GETS TO 40 FIRST IN THIS GAME.
YOU HEARD THE GUYS IF YOU FOLLOWED "GAME DAY" THIS
MORNING, KIRK AND DESMOND AND OTHERS WERE TALKING ABOUT IT
BEING A ONE POSSESSION GAME AND THEY EXPECTED CAL TO FIGHT THIS
THING DOWN TO THE END AND BE A LOT OF POINTS SCORED.
WE ALREADY HAVE 55. &gt;&gt; Mark: COACH TELLING US
YESTERDAY THAT ANY TIME YOU GET A CHANCE TO PLAY AGAINST A
NUMBER FIVE TEAM AND GET A WIN, IT IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.
LITTLE HOOK AND LADDER, TO BUG RIVERA, AND THE PLAY WHISTLE
DEAD AT THE 37-YARD LINE. THAT'S GOING TO BE THE LAST PLAY
OF THE FIRST HALF. &gt;&gt; Rod: DO I HAVE TO SEE THOSE
TYPE PLAYS EVER AGAIN? FIVE LATERAL PLAYS TO END A
GAME? &gt;&gt; Mark: I WASN'T GOING TO BRING
IT UP. &gt;&gt; Rod: WELL, THEY JUST DID IT.
&gt;&gt; Mark: I WASN'T GOING TO BRING IT UP.
FLASHBACKS FROM MY PARTNER, FOLKS.
&gt;&gt; Rod: GETTING A LITTLE CHIPPY OUT THERE.
&gt;&gt; Mark: AND A FLAG THROWN AT THE 37 YARD LINE.
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE THEM COME BACK AND PLAY ANOTHER ONE,
ARE THEY? &gt;&gt; Rod: WELL, YOU'VE GOT A FLAG.
&gt;&gt; Referee: AFTER THE PLAY WAS OVER, UNSPORTSMAN LIKE CONDUCT,
NUMBER 79 ON CALIFORNIA. THAT PENALTY WILL BE ENFORCED ON
THE SECOND HALF KICKOFF. &gt;&gt; Rod: OH, WOW.
&gt;&gt; Mark: UNSPORTSMANLIKE CONDUCT.
&gt;&gt; Rod: YEAH, THAT'S GOING TO GIVE WASHINGTON RECEIVING THE
KICKOFF AN OPPORTUNITY FOR REALLY GOOD FIELD POSITION.
&gt;&gt; Mark: A PUZZLING END TO THE FIRST HALF FOR COACH DIKES.
LET'S HEAD TO THE STUDIO FOR THE BMW HALFTIME REPORT.
GUYS. &gt;&gt; JOHN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
ALONGSIDE DANDY, CANAL, I'M. IT IS THE BMW HALFTIME RECORD.
IN THE FIRST QUARTER, JAYLIN HURTS, ALABAMA QUARTERBACK,
INTERCEPTED BY ALLEN. THIS IS A HUGE BREAK, GETTING
THE BALL IN GOOD FIELD POSITION. &gt;&gt; LSU HAD A GREAT GAME PLAN,
CAME OUT AND DID A GREAT JOB OF STOPPING HIM IN THE AIR.
THE PROBLEM IS HE CAN HURT YOU WITH HIS LEGS.
&gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO SCORE POINTS HERE, JOEY.
A GREAT JOB BY RONNIE HARRISON. &gt;&gt; BEGINNING OF A BAD OFFENSIVE
NIGHT FOR LSU, TURN THE BALL OVER ON 35 AND GET NOTHING OUT
OF IT. &gt;&gt; WE'VE HEARD THIS STORY, CAN'T
RUN THE BALL AGAINST THEIR DEFENSE.
HAPPENED AGAIN. &gt;&gt; THEY TRIED, GAVE HIM THE
ROCK, GOT HIM IN A DIFFERENT POSITION, SAW A A LOT OF
FORMATION, AND TRYING TO RUN AGAINST THE ALABAMA FRONT SEVEN
WILL BE A FUTILE EFFORT EVERY TIME.
&gt;&gt; 17 CARRIES, 35 YARDS RUSHING, FIRST PLAY OF THE FOURTH
QUARTER. THIS GIEM WAS STILL SCORELESS
BUT THEN ALABAMA STARTED TO GET MOVEMENT HERE, AND IT WAS HURTS
USING HIS LEGS AS WELL. &gt;&gt; LSU STARTING TO GET WORN
DOWN. PLAYED TERRIFIC FOR
THREE-QUARTERS, BUT IF YOUR OFFENSE DOESN'T HELP YOU, YOU
GET WORN OUT. &gt;&gt; ALABAMA WINS THIS ONE 10-0.
FINALLY, AS THE OFFENSE BROKE THROUGH, LSU HAD ONE FIRST DOWN
IN THE SECOND HALF AND 125 YARDS TOTAL.
HOW IMPRESSED ARE YOU WITH BAMA'S DEFENSIVE EFFORT?
&gt;&gt; REALLY IMPRESSIVE, BUT I THINK YOU HAVE TO AT THAT TIME
WITH A GRAIN OF SALT. DANNY ETLING STRUGGLED
THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT. BUT YOU HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO
ALABAMA. THEY WERE HITTING HIM, KNOCKING
HIM ON HIS BACK. I LOOK AT THAT AUBURN GAME.
AUBURN IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO MOVE THIS FOOTBALL AGAINST THE
ALABAMA, AND THEIR DEFENSE SHOULD BE ABLE TO STOP THEM.
&gt;&gt; THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO BEAT A TEAM LIKE ALABAMA.
ETLING DIDN'T HAVE TO HAVE A GREAT NIGHT BUT HAD TO BE A
LITTLE MORE EE EFFICIENT WHEN HE HAD OPPORTUNITIES.
THERE'S A LOT OF MISSED RECEIVERS, ESPECIALLY IN THE
SECOND HALF WHEN THEY HAD CHANCES ON THIRD DOWNS TO STAY
ON THE FIELD THAT THEY DIDN'T COMPLETE.
ALL OF A SUDDEN DEFENSE STARTS TO PLAY A LOT OF PLAYS AGAINST A
PHYSICAL ALABAMA TEAM. YOU'RE GOING TO GET TIRED AND
BEAT. &gt;&gt; ALABAMA, ONCE AGAIN 13
STRAIGHT WINS OVER AP RANKED OPPONENTS AND SHUTOUT AGAINST
BENGALS. STILL TO COME ON THE HALF TIME
REPORT, A LITTLE CF 3 AIM THREE. LAMAR JACKSON ADDING ANOTHER
SEVEN TOUCHDOWNS TO HIS TOTAL.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt; Rod: IF YOU'RE GOING TO PULL
THE UPSET, YOU HAVE TO BE AGGRESSIVE.
YOU HAVE TO MATCH. CAL CAN'T BE PASSIVE ON THIS
DRIVE OR THIS GAME COULD GET AWAY FROM THEM.
&gt;&gt; Mark: NICE RUN. AND ANOTHER FIRST DOWN.
THIS TIME TRE WATSON. THIS CAL RUN GAME IS MUCH
IMPROVED FROM THE START OF THE YEAR WHEN WE SAW THEM, ROD.
&gt;&gt; Rod: WELL, IF YOU WATCH WASHINGTON, THEY'VE GOT THEIR
OUTSIDE GUYS, THEY'RE DEFENSIVE END AND LINEBACKERS ARE REALLY
WIDE. IF YOU CAN GET INSIDE YOU HAVE A
CHANCE TO GET SOME YARDAGE. &gt;&gt; Mark: THEY TRIED TO RUN THE
SAME PLAY. THIS TIME WATSON DRAGGED DOWN.
&gt;&gt; Rod: YOU CAN'T RUN OUTSIDE ON THIS WASHINGTON TEAM.
THEY'RE TOO FAST. BUT UTAH HAD SUCCESS RUNNING
INSIDE, INSIDE OF THE DEFENSIVE END AND JUST OUTSIDE OF THE
TACKLE. THAT'S WHERE THE FIRST RUN CAME
FROM ON CAL. &gt;&gt; Mark: AFTER A BEAD OR TWO TOO
LONG, HE IS SACKED BY JOHNSON, JAYLIN JOHNSON.
&gt;&gt; Rod: GIVE THE CREDIT TO THE SECONDARY.
LOOK HOW LONG HE HOLDS THE FOOTBALL.
NOWHERE TO GO WITH IT. THAT'S THE SECARY LOCKING DOWN.
I KEEP;?Z                   &lt;u&gt; TET&lt;/u&gt; IS THE BEST SECONDARY IN COLLEGE
FOOTBALL. &gt;&gt; Mark: REALLY?
&gt;&gt; Rod: THESE CORNERS ARE REALLY, REALLY GOOD.
&gt;&gt; Mark: 27th START OF THE SEASON FOR THE HUSKIES ON THEz&amp;
COMEBACK PATTERN COMPLETE TO ROBERON, THE TALENTED
FRESHMAN, BUT HE'S GOING TO BE SHORT OF THE]IÃ FIRSTÃ±r DOWN.
AND FOURTH DOWN COMING UP FOR THE BEARS.m(Tâ
A AUDIENCE OUT.
THERE ROD GILMORE SAYS THATÃ§Ã³ CORNERS AS A TANDEMKIpÃ§^Ã±Ã§Ã³ IN
COUNTRY. &gt;&gt; Rod: I LIKE THEM.
&gt;&gt; Mark: OKAY. &gt;&gt; Rod: Ie1Ãi THINK IT WILL BE
PROVEN NOT ONLY THIS SEASON BUT YOU'LL WATCH THEM"WJu SEVERAL
YEARS IN THE Ã±rNFL. &gt;&gt; Mark: A LINE DRIVE PUNT,
FIELDED BY DONTE PETTIS WHO HAS FIVE CAREER PUNT RETURNG
TOUCHDOWNS. 38 YARD PUNT, NOTHING TO RETURN.

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; ESPN COLLEGE FOOTBALL IS
PRESENTED BY GEICO. 15 MINUTES COULD SAVE YOU 15% OR
MORE ON CAR INSURANCE, AND IN PART BY THE 2017 FORD FUSION,
THE BEAUTY OF A WELL-MADE CHOICE.
&gt;&gt; Mark: OH, MARSHAUN ALL KIND OF CRUNCH RIGHT MERE.
ALMOST HIT A BAND MEMBER. WELCOME.
DR. PEPPER'S CHAMPIONSHIP DRIVE. GAME OF THE WEEK, WASHINGTON
NUMBER FIVE, AGAINST CAL. THERE'S A LOOK AT THE FORMER
SEATTLE SEAHAWKS, FORMER CAL BEAR.
IT WAS TEN YEARS AGO THAT HE PUT THAT MAGICAL RIDE, THAT SPIN ON
THE BALL. BROWNING UNDER HEAT, THROWS IT
AWAY. PRESSURE BY CAMERON SAFFLE ON
THE PLAY. AND THIS IS WHAT HE DE ON THE
WIN AFTER 2006 AFTER THE WIN AGAINST THE HUSKIES.
&gt;&gt; Rod: I THINK HE RECREATED IT PRETTY WELL.
HE DIDN'T HAVE MAMA LYNCH WITH HIM BACK THEN, BUT DID A NICE
JOB TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; Mark: DIDN'T HAVE HIS WHIP,
SO USED THE GOLF CART. &gt;&gt; Referee: THERE WAS NO --
&gt;&gt; Mark: AGAINST BROWNING. &gt;&gt; Rod: WHAT THEY GET HIM FOR
HERE, YOU HEARD THE OFFICIAL SAY HE WASN'T OUTSIDE OF THE TACKLE
BOX. THAT TACKLE BOX EXTENDS
VERTICALLY BACK THROUGH THE END ZONE.
HAD HE BEEN TO HIS RIGHT A LITTLE BIT, HE WOULD HAVE BEEN
OKAY, BUT INSIDE THAT TACKLE BOX, CAN'T DO IT.
AND THERE'S NOBODY OVER THERE. &gt;&gt; Mark: NOW THEY'RE SAYING IT
IS A SAFETY AS A RESULT. &gt;&gt; Rod: BECAUSE HE WAS IN THE
END ZONE. &gt;&gt; Mark: YEAH.
LOOKED LIKE HE WAS -- THAT'S CLOSE.
THAT'S CLOSE. I DIDN'T THINK HE WAS QUITE IN
THE END ZONE, BUT THEY'RE GOING TO SAY IT IS A SAFETY.
&gt;&gt; F/Mi HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHEN THE
                            0B OFFICIAL BLEW THAT.
IT DOESN'T LOOK TO ME LIKE HE WAS IN THE END ZNÃ­.
&gt;&gt; Mark: NO. &gt;&gt; Rod: LOOKS TOÃ§Ã³ ME LIKEÃ©@â  H
THREW IT WELLÃ§Ã³ BEFORE HE GOT IO THE ENDxD ZONE.
&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;KD8AND I DON'T THINK THEY BLEW  &lt;/font&gt; PLAY DEAD, YOU KNOW, WHEN HE WAS
IN THEzMÃ© THAT'S -- THAT LOOKS LIKE THAT
IS SHORT OF THE END ZONE. ANGLE WHERE)(:â
&gt;&gt; Mark: I THINK THEY'RE GOING &gt;&gt; Rod: YEAH, FROM THOSE ANGLES
HE'S IN THE FIELD OF PLAY AND THE BALL IS IN THE FIELD OF
PLAY. REMEMBER, ON THESE REVIEWS WE
NEED INDISPUTEABLE VIDEO EVIDENCE.
&gt;&gt; Mark: WE'RE GOING TO TAKE ONE MORE LOOK AT IT.
&gt;&gt; Rod: FROM MY VANTAGE POINT, I DON'T EVEN SEE HOW THE
FOOTBALL'S IN THE END ZONE THERE.
I THINK THAT'S PRETTY CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT HE'S IN THE FIELD
OF PLAY. THE BALL LOOKS LIKE IT WAS IN
THE FIELD OF PLAY. &gt;&gt; Mark: YEAH, IT WAS OUT OF HIS
HANDS WELL BEFORE HE WAS IN THE END ZONE.
USUALLY, ROD, WE TALKED ABOUT IT BEFORE, WHEN WE TAKE THIS ON IT
APPEARS THAT MOST TIMES THAN NOT THEY REVERSE IT AND TRY AND SEE
WHERE THE BALL SHOULD BE SPOTTED AND HOW MUCH TIME TO PUT BACK ON
THE CLOCK. &gt;&gt; Rod: YEAH, USUALLY YOU'RE
RIGHT, MAN. WHEN THIS TAKES THIS LONG TO
LOOK AT IT, I THINK THEY'VE LOOKED AT IT AND FIGURED OUT HE
WAS IN THE FIELD OF PLAY. I THINK THEY'RE LOOKING AT IT
NOW AND CHECKING THE CLOCK, CHECKING EXACTLY WHERE TO SPOT
IT. BECAUSE I THINK THAT WAS PRETTY
INDISPUTEABLE THAT HE WAS IN THE FIELD OF PLAY.
&gt;&gt; Mark: 7-5, WASHINGTON WITH THE LEAD.
THEY STRUCK LAST TIME THEY HAD THE BALL AND A LONG PASS AND
CATCH FROM BROWNING TO ROSS. &gt;&gt; Referee: THE QUARTERBACK WAS
IN THE FIELD OF PLAY WHEN HE RELEASED THE BALL.
THE BALL WILL BE PLACED AT THE 1 1/2 HARD LINE.
SECOND DOWN. LOSS OF DOWN.
THERE'S STILL A FOUL FOR INTENTIONAL GROUNDING.
&gt;&gt; Mark: THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE THE TWO POINTS OFF THE BOARD.
AND PUT THE BALL HALF A YARD AWAY FROM THE END ZONE.
&gt;&gt; Rod: HOW AGGRESSIVE WILL CAL BE HERE?
YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE A TEAM THAT IS AN UNDERDOG, YOU'RE THINKING
HERE IS A CHANCE TO CREATE SOMETHING.
BUT, REMEMBER, ROSS JUST RAN DOWN THE FIELD ON 'EM.
YOU DON'T WANT TO OPEN UP YOURSELF TO A 99 YARD BOMB WITH
ROSS RUNNING BY YOU, ALTHOUGH ROSS IS NOT OUT THERE RIGHT NOW.
YOU CAN BE AGGRESSIVE. &gt;&gt; Mark: 12 PERSONNEL.
THEY RUN IT OUT IN THE END ZONE. GASKIN WITH A GOOD BURST DOWN TO
THE 12-YARD LINE, GIVING THEM PLENTY OF SPACE.
VANDERBILT MAKING A STOP ON THE PLAY.
GAIN OF TEN FOR THE HUSKIES. &gt;&gt; Rod: LOOK HOW DEEP THE
HAND-OFF IS. HE HAS TO THINK IN TERMS OF
GETTING UP THERE, BUT SUCH A GREAT JOB OF HUNTING DOWN THE
CAL LINEBACKER, GETTING HIM OUT OF THE WAY. GASKINS HAD PLENTY MANY TIME TO
RUN UP THE FIELD. &gt;&gt; Mark: THIRD AND LONG.
TEN TO GO. PETTIS IN MOTION.
BROWNING WITH TIME. AND INCOMPLETE.
INTENDED FOR ROSS. THAT WASN'T EVEN CLOSE.
IT WILL BE FOURTH DOWN, AND WILL HAVE TO PUNT.
THEY'RE REALLY BACKED UP HERE, SO THE BEARS SHOULD GET GOOD
FIELD POSITION. GOOD COVERAGE ON THE PLAY BY
FRANKLIN. &gt;&gt; Rod: YOU WERE TALKING EARLIER
ABOUT THE COMMITTEE RANKING THEM NUMBER FIVE AND, YOU KNOW, BUT
FOR THE ROSS PLAY YOU'D HAVE TO SAY, YOU KNOW, WASHINGTON DOES
NOT LOOK DOMINANT. THEY'VE HAD A COUPLE OF
LACKLUSTER POSSESSIONS, A BAD KICK, BAD PUNT ON SPECIAL TEAMS.
ROSS BAILED THEM OUT WITH A HUGE TOUCHDOWN CATCH, JUST RAN BY THE
DEFENSE. BUT RIGHT NOW A BIG OPPORTUNITY,
BUT NOT DOMINANT. &gt;&gt; Mark: A RUGBY STYLE KICK.
A LINE DRIVE FIELDED ON THE RUN BY WARD EN. WARDEN WITH A HEAD OF STEAM.
OUT OF BOUNDS AT THE 17-YARD LINE.
ONCE AGAIN, THE FIELD POSITION GAME, ROD, TILTING IN CAL'S
FAVOR. &gt;&gt; Rod: RIGHT NOW SPECIAL TEAMS
ARE KILLING WASHINGTON, AND BOTH PUNTS WERE TERRIBLE.
THE FIRST ONE GAVE CAL A FIRST DOWN AT THE 35.
THIS ONE WILL PUT THEM INSIDE THE 20.
&gt;&gt; Mark: FOOTBALL MATCHUP FEATURES TYROD TAYLOR AND THE
BILLS TAKING ON RUSSELL WILSON AND THE SEAHAWKS FROM CENTURY
LINK IN SEATTLE, 8:15 ON ESPN. FIRST AND 10, DAVIS WEBB HANDS
IT OFF TO MUHAMMAD. MUHAMMAD PICKS UP ABOUT THREE ON
THE PLAY. TURPIN MAKING THE TACKLE.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE IMPROVED CAL RUNNING GAME SO FAR?
&gt;&gt; Rod: SO FAR SO GOOD. THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO RUN INSIDE
THE BIG TAM OF TACKS. WASHINGTON HAS A HUGE DEFENSIVE
LINE. &gt;&gt; Mark: TALKING ABOUT QUARLES,
NUMBER 11 AND NUMBER 99, GREG GAIN.
WELL NORTH OF 300 POUNDS. WEBB GOES THROUGH PROGRESSION
INTO THE END ZONE. KICKED AWAY BY KEVIN KING.
THOSE CORNERS ARE GOOD, ROD. &gt;&gt; Rod: OH, MAN.
&gt;&gt; Mark: TALL, TOO. HE IS 6'3".
&gt;&gt; Rod: FUN TO WATCH HIM PLAY. KNOWS HE CAN'T MAKE THE ONE
HANDED GRAB, KNOCKS IT AWAY. THESE TWO CORNERS ARE REALLY,
REALLY GOOD. &gt;&gt; Mark: THIRD AND SEVEN.
HANSEN NOT IN THE BALL GAME. WEBB.
FIRES. NO SIGNAL YET, AND THEY'RE GOING
TO SAY IT IS INCOMPLETE. INTENDED FOR STOVALL, AND ONCE
AGAIN KING THERE TO DEFEND. &gt;&gt; Rod: STOVALL IS ONE OF THE
TWO FRESHMAN RECEIVERS PLAYING WELL FOR CAL.
NOT THE BIGGEST GUY AT ABOUT 5'9".
LOOK AT HIM GO DOWN FOR THIS. THAT BALL IS BATTED AWAY.
ANOTHER GOOD PLAY BY KING. BACK TO BACK.
LOOK AT HIM REACH AROUND AND KNOCK THAT AWAY.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME? &gt;&gt; Mark: YOU GET EXCITED OVER DB
PLAY. &gt;&gt; Rod: DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH BAD
DB YOUÃ§Ã³ SEEÃi OUT &lt;9[
                        &lt;u&gt;Ã±&lt;/u&gt; &gt;&gt; Mark: DB AIN'T EASY TV%(E
DAYS WITH THE SPREADt( OFFENSES THAT YOU SEE.
BUT jvEL1Ã± A LITTLEÃ±r3Wâ  BIT OF DEVIATION FROM THE NORM.
GREAT PLAY TO BREAK IT '&gt; FOURTHÃi AND SEVEN, DOWN TO QUI.
&gt;&gt; Quint: WATi TAKINGt RIGHT THERE, HOPING TO GET A
VIDEO REVIEW. I'M SURPRISED WE DIDN'T HAVE A
DELAY OF GAME PENALTY THERE. &gt;&gt; Mark: YEAH, YOU COULD WAIT A
LONG TIME, QUINT, AND NOT GET THE DESIRED RESULT.
FROMxD 30 YARDS OUT, ANDERSONÃ¡' COMPLETED ONE, MADE ONEÃ§Ã³ FROM
EARLIER. AND HITS THIS ONE AS WELL.
IT IS A ONE POINT BALL GAME. BACK AFTER THIS. &gt;&gt; Mark: BACK AT MEMORIAL
STADIUM UNDER THE LIGHTS, MARK JONES ALONGSIDE ROD GILMORE AND
QUINT KESSENICH. BE ON THE LOOK OUT FOR TACO BELL
STUDENT AREAS AND PASSIONUAL FANS LIKE THESE ALL SEASON LONG.
WAITING FOR QUINT TO GET IN THAT SECTION LIKE HE DID LAST WEEK.
&gt;&gt; Rod: YOU THINK HE HAS A TACO FOR YOU OR SOMETHING?
&gt;&gt; Mark: HE MIGHT HAVE A LITTLE SURPRISE.
HE'S A MAN OF MANY TALENTS. SOME OFF THE FIELD THAT WE MIGHT
EVEN SEE SOMETIME LATER. CALLED THE CHEESE IN THE
BUSINESS THERE, ROD. &gt;&gt; Rod: OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
&gt;&gt; Mark: 7-6 IN THE FIRST QUARTER.
IF YOU ARE JUST JOINING US, WASHINGTON UP WITH THE TOUCHDOWN
PASS TO ROSS EARLIER. AND THERE IS A LOOK AT ONE OF
THE BEST KICKOFF RETURN MEN IN SCHOOL HISTORY.
HE HAS FOUR KICKOFF RETURN TOUCHDOWNS IN HIS CAREER.
THIS IS JOYNER. AND JOYNER BROUGHT DOWN AT THE
33-YARD LINE WHERE IT WILL BE FIRST DOWN AND 10.
DOWN TO QUINT. &gt;&gt; Quint: THIS IS NOT A MIDNIGHT
SNACK. THIS IS A SANDWICH, BECAUSE IN
IS A SANDWICH GAME FOR THIS WASHINGTON TEAM.
GO BACK LAST WEEK, GUTSY WIN ON THE ROAD AT UTAH.
YOU LOOK AHEAD, YOU'VE GOT USC COMING UP AT HOME NEXT WEEK, A
HUGE GAME. WELL, CAL IS --
&gt;&gt; Rod: YOU ARE RUNNING AGAINST A DEFENSE THAT HAS STRUGGLED TO
STOP THE RUN, AND YOU KEEP THAT HIGH POWERED OFFENSE ON THE SIDE
LINE. I THINK YOU'LL SEE A LOT MORE OF
THAT, AND THEN AS SOON AS CAL STARTS TO BRING ANOTHER SAFETY
UP TO DEAL WITH THE RUSHING ATTACK, THEY'LL GO DEEP AGAIN.
&gt;&gt; Mark: THIS TIME THEY EMPTY OUT THE BACK FIELD.
TO THE TOP OF THE SCREEN. LOOK OUT FOR THE PLAY.
HERE IT IS. PETTIS WIDE OPEN.
ROOM SERVICE, TOUCHDOWN, DANIELS.
WELL, THE TRICK PLAY IS ALWAYS IN THE BOOK.
THE DOUBLE PASS AND PETTIS, A FORMER MAJOR LEAGUER DARRYL
PETTIS, HIS DAD DAD. &gt;&gt; Mark: HE PITCHED IT ALL
RIGHT. THE HUSKIES LEADS IT 14-6.
NUMBER FIVE TEAM IN THE COUNTRY. TRYING TO MAKE A MOVE ON TEXAS A
&amp; M. TUESDAY, WE REVEAL THE TOP 25
RANKINGS. REESE AND THE CREW BREAKING THEM
DOWN FROM TOP TO BOTTOM. HAVE COACHES' REACTIONS AS WELL
AS NEW AND LIVE INTERVIEWS WITH COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN KIRBY HOCUT
TUESDAY AT 7:00 P.M. ON ESM, ALSO STREAMING LIVE ON THE ESPN
APP. GO BACK TO COACH PETERSON'S DAYS
AT BOISE STATE, THE HOOK AND LADDER, STATUE OF LIBERTY.
THE GUY'S GOT A LOT OF TOOLS IN THE TRICK BOX.
AND HE PULLED OUT THE DOUBLE PASS ON THAT ONE.
CHRIS PETERSON A CALIFORNIA NATIVE.
&gt;&gt; Rod: THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF THAT WHOLE DEAL ABOUT THEY USED
TO DO AT BOISE STATE, BRING THEIR TRICK PLAYS.
CHRIS PETERSON UP THERE, AND RUN HIS BEFORE YOU GET A CHANCE TO
RUN YOURS AND KIND OF INTIMIDATE YOU WITH IT.
AND YOU KNOW HE'S GOT A COUPLE MORE.
&gt;&gt; Mark: YEAH, YOU'VE GOT TO STAY AWAKE.
ROBERTSON BACK THERE, AWAITING THE KICKOFF.

TRE WATSON BROUGHT DOWN NEAR THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE.
HE FELL FORWARD FOR A YARD. &gt;&gt; Rod: HOW WOULDÃ§Im' YOU LIKE E
NUMBER 28, OUTSIDE LINEBACKER. YOU GhKNOW, YOU'RE NOT A BIG GU]
YOU'RE 230 POUNDS ANDÃ±r YOU HAV TOq BLOCK A 300 POUND FULL[JÃ­Y
&gt;&gt; Mark: YEAH, NUMBER 99 LEADINC AND WITH A COUPLE OF PLAYS AS WG
GO DOWN TO QUINT FORoI+ &gt;&gt; Quint: YOU ARE SEEING THE
WORK OF TWO OFJR&amp;Ã· THEI2â ( BEST KWAULS, LETS THIS GUY WARM UP.
HE WAS MAKING ONE HANDED CATCHE AND RUNNING ROUTES.
HE WAS A GREATxD WRESTLER. ANOTHERÃ±r 320 POUNDER, THESE GU

IN TO PUNT. KEEP AN EYE ON PETTIS.
PUNT RETURN, TRYING TO GETok OUTSIDE AND PUSHED OUT OF BOUNDS
ABOUT THE 35. AS WE GO BACK TO ED AND BERT IN
THE STUDIO. &gt;&gt; Mark: OKAY.
FIRST AND TEN. GASKIN MET IMMEDIATELY AND
WRAPPED UP AT THE 30-YARD LINE. GOOD STICK BY FRANKLIN.
&gt;&gt; Rod: YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE INJURY DEPLETED SECONDARY AND
YOU'RE DOWN 14, YEAH, MAKE THE TACKLE, LINEUP, THAT'S ALL.
JUST LINE UP. I MEAN TRASH TALKING IS FINE
WHEN YOU'RE GETTING IT DONE, BUT, OH, OH, A LITTLE EARLY FOR
THAT ONE. &gt;&gt; Mark: YEAH.
THOSE GUYS WERE LOOKING AT JOHN ROSS'S SHOE SIZE A FEW PLAYS
AGO. SECOND AND 12.
AND THEY GO DEEP AGAIN AND THEY GOT HIM AGAIN.
ROSS. COMES BACK AND GETS ACROSS.
ROSS LIKE A BOSS. TOUCHDOWN!
&gt;&gt; Rod: WHAT'S WITH THE TRASH TALKING?
THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO BE AFRAID OF, THAT GUY RIGHT THERE.
&gt;&gt; Mark: WELL, COACH HAD NO -- &gt;&gt; Rod: HE GETS A CHANCE TO MAKE
EVERYBODY IN THAT SECONDARY MIX. THEY HAD TWO SHOTS AT HIM.
WELL, COACH ACTUALLY HAD TWO CHANCES TO GET ROSS AND BOTH
TIMES ROSS RAN BY HIM. THIS IS JUST RIDICULOUS.
&gt;&gt; Mark: JOHN ROSS IS LIKE I'M GOING TO PUT YOU ON MY HIGHLIGHT
TAPE TWICE. &gt;&gt; Rod: I MEAN THE FIRST ONE IS
PURE SPEED. HE JUST RUNS BY HIM, AND WAITS
FOR AN UNDER THROWN BALL AND JUST DUKES.
AND WOOCHING. &gt;&gt; Mark: YOU SEE SOME OF THE
PIER OWE TECH NICKS AND THE EXPLOSIVENESS OF THE HUSKIES
OFFENSE. 21 POINTS ON THE BOARD ALREADY.
&gt;&gt; Rod: YOU SEE, TRASH TALKING IS FINE WHEN YOU CAN BACK IT UP.
WHEN ALL YOU DO IS INSPIRE THE OTHER GUY TO DROP THE BOMB ON
YOU, BACK DOWN A LITTLE BIT. &gt;&gt; Mark: THAT'S GOOD ADVICE AND
MAYBE THAT'S WHAT HE IS HEARING NOW FROM HIS COACHES ON THE SIDE
LINE. 217 TO GO IN THE FIRST QUARTER.
ROSS WITH TWO TOUCHDOWN RECEPTIONS ALREADY.
FORMER HIGH SCHOOL TRACK STAR OUT OF LONG BEACH, CALIFORNIA.
CAL FUMBLES THE KICKOFF AT THE 26-YARD LINE, AND THEY HAVE TO
BE CAREFUL HERE. TAKE ONE MORE LOOK AT THAT
TOUCHDOWN, ROD. &gt;&gt; Rod: WATCH THE MATCHUP.
THE MATCHUP IS UP HERE AND THERE'S YOUR SAFETY WHO WILL
COME OUT OF THE MIX. GOT PRETTY MUCH SINGLE MAN
COVERAGE HERE. WATCH HIM RUN BY.
YOU HAVE TO KNOW YOU CANNOT RUN WITH A GUY WHO IS 429.
YOU HAVE TO GIVE HIM A LITTLE MORE CUSHION THERE.
ONCE HE GETS THAT ON YOU, MAN, THE CHANGE OF DIRECTION, ALL OF
THOSE WILL BE COMING OUT FOR ROSS.
&gt;&gt; Mark: FIRST AND TEN. COMPLETE OVER THE MIDDLE TO
RIVERA, NUMBER 26, SLOT RECEIVER, HIS FIRST CATCH.
&gt;&gt; Rod: THOSE TWO BIG PLAYS BY ROSS NOW REALLY CHANGE THE
DEFENSE. THEY CAN'T PLAY THE RUN.
THEY HAVE TO BE AWARE OF THAT. &gt;&gt; Mark: RIVERA AGAIN, AND PICKS
UP ENOUGH FOR THE FIRST DOWN. THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE
SOME MAJOR ADJUSTMENTS DEFENSIVELY.
&gt;&gt; Rod: WHICH WILL GIVE WASHINGTON A CHANCE TO RUN THE
FOOTBALL AGAINST CAL WHENEVER THEY WANT.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM WHEN YOU GIVE THEM BIG THROWS, AND THIS IS
CRITICAL FOR CAL NOW. THEY'VE GOT TO KEEP IN CONTACT
BY GETTING A SCORE. &gt;&gt; Mark: TAKEN A SHOT.
HAS A MAN. ROBERTSON ANSWERS, AND HE STEPS
OUT OF BOUNDS THEY'RE GOING TO SAY AT THE THREE YARD LINE.
HE GOT IN BIND KING, AND IT IS FIRST AND GOAL.
61 YARDS ON THE PASS AND CATCH. &gt;&gt; Rod: AND A PERFECTLY THROWN
BALL BY WEBB. YEAH, LOOKS LIKE HE STEPPED OUT
AT ABOUT THE FOUR. &gt;&gt; Mark: I WAS CLOSE.
&gt;&gt; Rod: AND ROBERTSON IS THE OTHER FRESHMAN.
WE TALKED ABOUT STOVALL EARLIER, BUT ROBERTSON IS COMING OFF HIS
BEST GAME OF THE SEASON AGAINST USC IN WHICH HE HAD NINE
CATCHES. &gt;&gt; Mark: HE, YOU WOULD FIGURE,
WOULD BE A BIGGER COMPONENT OF THEIR OFFENSE WITH CHAD HANSEN
HURTING IN THIS BALL GAME. COACH SIKES IS IRATE ON THE
SIDELINES, PERHAPS THINKING THEY NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AND SEE IF
ROBERTSON ACTUALLY STEPPED OUT OF BOUNDS.
HE'S MAD ABOUT SOMETHING. &gt;&gt; Rod: REMEMBER, THE CALL ON
THE FIELD WAS THAT HE STEPPED OUT.
AND THAT WAS THE LOOK RIGHT THERE.
I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE OFFICIAL WHO WAS RIGHT ON IT
FELT THAT HE STEPPED OUT, RIGHT THERE.
&gt;&gt; Mark: YEAH, HE DID. &gt;&gt; Rod: WHITE SHOE ON THE WHITE
TURF. HE KICKED UP SOME BLACK -- YOU
KNOW, THE LITTLE PEBBLES THERE. I THINK THAT'S WHY THE CALL WAS
MADE BY THE OFFICIAL WHO SAW IT, AND SONNY DIKES DOESN'T AGREE
WITH IT, BUT FROM THAT ANGLE IT LOOKED LIKE A PRETTY GOOD CALL
FROM THE OFFICIAL ON THE SIDE LINE THERE.
&gt;&gt; Mark: MIGHT BE AN ISSUE WITH THE PLAY CLOCK TOO THAT RAN
DOWN. &gt;&gt; Rod: LET'S GO BACK AND TAKE A
LOOK AT THAT. THAT PLAY WAS A GREAT THROW BY
WEBB. WATCH THE PROTECTION HE GETS.
BUT KING GETS BEATEN ON THE OUTSIDE, AND ROBERTSON TAKES
THAT PERFECTLY WELL. DROPPED IN THERE, AND IT WAS
THAT ONE STEP THAT I DON'T THINK DIKES COULD SEE FROM THE
SIDELINES OR THAT MANY OF THE</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE BMW ALL-PERFORMANCE NOMINEE, AND
UTAH'S JOE WILLIAMS. 332 RUSHING YARDS, AND A SCHOOL
RECORD, AND ALSO FOUR TOUCHDOWNS.
THIS IS A GUY WHO RETIRED AND CAME BACK.
&gt;&gt; GOOD FOR HIM. &gt;&gt; AND THE BMW ALL PERFORMANCE
TODAY. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.
TOP TEN BLITZ. THE BEST SCHOOLS RIGHT NOW IN
THE COUNTRY, AND PLAYS FEATURING THEM.
SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT HERE, AND HOW ABOUT WISCONSIN
AND IOWA AND A TOUCHDOWN HERE FOR WISCONSIN TO LEAD.
&gt;&gt; AND THIS WISCONSIN TEAM WITH THE CHANCE TO WIN THE BIG TEN
WEST AND CHASING NEBRASKA, AND THEY HAVE TO HOPE THAT NEBRASKA
LOSES ANOTHER GAME ALONG THE WAY.
&gt;&gt; AND COREY CLEMON THERE ON THE  THE BALL.
&gt;&gt; AND LAMAR JACKSON HOSTING LOUISVILLE AND N.C. STATE.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS A LAMAR JACKSON SHOW, AND EVERY TIME YOU SEE
LOUISVILLE PLAY, HE IS THE FRONT-RUNNER THE HEISMAN AND HE
IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO PUT UP THE HUGE NUMBERS.
&gt;&gt; AND HE IS NOT THE FRONT RUN E  THAT IS WHAT HE IS.
&gt;&gt; AND 54-13 AS JACKSON PADS THE STATS EVEN MORE.
&gt;&gt; AND HOW ABOUT MICHIGAN? &gt;&gt; WELL, A FAKE HERE FOR
MICHIGAN TO WIN AT THE INTERMISSION.
&gt;&gt; THE FIRST HALF, THEY THOUGHT EASY, BUT THE SECOND HALF, HERE COMES THE TEST.
AND MICHIGAN STATE HAS NOT BASKETBALL LOOKING GOOD, BUT
THEY ARE LOOKING AT OHIO STATE AT THE END OF THE SEASON.
&gt;&gt; AND MICHIGAN IS GOING TO WITH WIN THIS ONE, AND ALSO, NUMBER
EIGHT, NEBRASKA HOSTING PURDUE. THIS IS TOMMY AM STRONG JUNIOR,
AND THE BACKUP HERE. &gt;&gt; AND TOMMY ARMSTRONG WITH THIS
OFFENSE, AND THIS IS THE NEBRASKA TEAM THAT I STILL DON'T
KNOW HOW GOOD THEY ARE, BECAUSE OF THE QUALITY OF THE WIN, AND
ANOTHER ONE AGAINST PURDUE. &gt;&gt; AND NOW, CHRIS PETERSEN
HOSTING OREGON STATE, AND NOW, DONTE PETTIS HERE, AS THEY GO ON
IN. AND WASHINGTON LEADING IT.
&gt;&gt; THE SURPRISE OF THE COLLEGE FOOTBALL SEASON IS WASHINGTON
SEPARATING ITSELF AS THE PAC-12 LEADER.
&gt;&gt; MORE UPDATES AFTER THIS.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; HOWARD AND WEST VIRGINIA
HOSTING TCU AND THE MOUNTAINEERS ARE LEADING.
A GREAT CATCH THIS THE END ZONE. &gt;&gt; THERE IS FOUR OR FIVE PLAYS,
OR FOUR OR FIVE CATCHES THAT YOU COULD SEE FROM THE ROOKIE WIDE
RECEIVERS MAKING PLAYS ALL DAY LONG.
&gt;&gt; AND NOW, MOVING UP IN THE OVERALL RANKINGS.
PENN STATE AND OHIO STATE, AND THIS IS McSORLEY OVER TO THE
SAYED BLACKWELL, AND NOW, THROWING IT UP TO GIVE THE
RECEIVER A CHANCE TO MAKE THE PLAY, AND PENN STATE IS MAKING

      <description>LEONARD FOURNETTE.
HE MISSED THE LAST FEW GAMES WITH A LEFT ANKLE INJURY, AND HE
MADE THE PRESENCE FELT EARLY, AND LOOKING EXPLOSIVE AND HE MAY
NOT BE 100%, BUT SHOWING TREMENDOUS SPEED AND POWER, AND
SIX CARRIES FOR 171 YARDS ALREADY FOR THE LSU RUNNING
BACKMENT THAF HAVE BEEN CREATIVE IN HOW THEY HAVE BEEN USING HIM
OUT OF THE BACKFIELD, AND A GREAT SERIES OF PLAYS FOR OLE
MISS LATE IN THE FIRST HALF. MARQUESS HAYNES AND HE GETS THE
SACK ON DANNY ETLING, AND THEY TAKE OVER DEEP IN LSU TERRITORY,
AND RUN A ZONE READ PLAY TO AKEEM JUDD, AND THEY WENT FOR IT
ON THE TWO-POINT CONVERSION, A BSZ CHAD KELLY RUNNING IT IN ON
THE ZONE READ, AND HERE WE ARE, BRENT, DEADLOCKED.
&gt;&gt; Brent: AND JUST AS CHAD KELLY IS BRINGING THE OFFENSE OUT,
THEIR FIRST POSSESSION HERE OF THE SECOND HALF, AND AFTER THE
TOUCHBACK, OF COURSE, THEY WILL START FROM THE 25.
WHAT OTHER THINGS DID YOU LIKE ABOUT IT?
&gt;&gt; Jesse: WELL, I LIKE THE FACT THAT HE SLINGS IT.
HE IS A COMPETITOR AND NOT GOING TO STOP TAKING THE SHOTS.
THIS OFFENSE IN THE EXPLOSIVE NATURE IS BUILT ON THE ABILITY
TO THROW THE VERTICAL BALL DOWN THE FIELD, AND THEY WON SOME OF
THE ONE-ON-ONE MATCHUPS AND LOST SOME, BUT IT IS NOT GOING TO BE
SCARING NUMBER 10 FROM SLINGING IT DOWN THE FIELD HERE IN THE
SECOND HALF. &gt;&gt; Brent: HE OPENS ONE JUDD AS
THE RUNNING BACK. FIRST CALL INTO THE MIDDLE TO
THE 30 YARD LINE. AND NEAL IS GOING TO BRING HIM
DOWN FOR LSU. SECOND DOWN AND FIVE.
BATTERING IT STRAIGHT AHEAD, JUST A YARD SHORT, AND NEAL
AGAIN. &gt;&gt; Jesse: THIS IS ONE THING TO
HELP CHAD KELLY IN THE VERTICAL PASSING END IF THEY CAN
ESTABLISH SOME OF THE RUN PLAYS, AND INSIDE ZONES, AND THAT IS
GOING TO ALLOW HIM TO CRASH IT DOWN THE FIELD.
THAT IS WHAT HE IS USED TO IN THIS OFFENSE.
&gt;&gt; Brent: JUDD, AND HE WAS STOPPED SHORT OF THE FIRST DOWN,
AND RILEY HIT HIM FIRST. &gt;&gt; Jesse: YES, DUKE RILEY FIRED
THROUGH THE GAP, AS THERE IS AN OLE MISS PLAYER DOWN ON THE
GROUND. IT LOOKS LIKE THE STARTING LEFT
TACKLE ROD TAYLOR GRABBING THE ANKLE.
THAT IS A CRITICAL POSITION IN THE GAME FOR OLE MISS, TOO,
BECAUSE HE IS THE GUY TO PROTECT CHAD KELLY'S BLINDSIDE FACING
ARDEN KEY WHO IS LEADING THE S.E.C. IN SACKS RIGHT NOW WITH
SEVEN. OLE MISS WITH THE EXCELLENT
BACKUP IN GREG LITTLE A TRUE FRESHMAN AND NUMBER WO OVERALL
PROSPECT IN HIGH SCHOOL, AND HE HAS GOTTEN A LOT OF SNAPS, AND
YOU CAN SEE THE FRIENDLY FIRE COMING IN BEHIND HIM, AND BLOCK
ING HIM AT THE ANKLE, AND RIGHT AWAY, HE GOES DOWN.
YOU CAN SEE THE LSU PLAYERS AND HOW MUCH THEY THE RESPECT ROD
TAYLOR, AND HUDDLING NEAR HIM. THAT IS A GREAT RIVALRY GAME,
OBVIOUSLY, BUT THESE PLAYERS A LOT OF THEM KNOW EACH OTHER
THIS, AND THEY PLAYED AGAINST EACH OTHER IN HIGH SCHOOL, AND
CERTAINLY, S.E.C. WEST OPPONENT, AND GOOD TO SEE HIM RIGHT THERE
GETTING UP. &gt;&gt; Brent: THAT IS GOING TO
PROBABLY SIGNAL THE ARRIVAL OF A FRESHMAN BY THE NAME OF GREG
LITTLE WHEN THEY COME BACK, AND RIGHT NOW, IT IS OF COURSE,
GOING TO BE THE PUNTING TEAM ON THE FIELD WITH FOURTH AND ONE
STOPPED ON THE FIRST SERIES. &gt;&gt; Brent: WHITE AGAIN GOING BACK
DEEP TO RETURN THIS PUNT. STANDING ON THE LSU 23.
GLEESON WITH THE LEFT FOOT, AND FAIR CATCH SIGNAL AT THE 22 YARD
LINE, AND THE CATCH IS MADE, AND AS KENTUCKY HAS BEATEN
MISSISSIPPI STATE AT THE BUS WER A FIELD GOAL, WE CHECK IN BELOW
WITH KAYLEE AND COACH O. &gt;&gt; Kaylee: BRETT, IF WE CUT DOWN
ON THE TURNOVERS AND KEEP GIVING IT TO LEONARD FOURNETTE, IT IS
GOING TO BE A VICTORY. BUT HE SAYS THAT THE TURNOVERS
ARE STOPPING THEM. WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING AT WHAT THE
DEFENSIVE BACKS HAVE DONE AS WELL, AND WE HAVE SEEN THE GOOD
AND THE BAD FROM THEM, AND HE SAYS A COUPLE OF BLOWN COVERAGES
AND A COUPLE OF CALLS THAT WERE  ABOUT THE ASSIGNMENTS HERE.
&gt;&gt; Brent: THE DANNY ETLING, AND THAT IS MOUTON STANDING IN FRONT
OF NUMBER 7, LEONARD FOURNETTE. RIGHT SIDE.
THERE'S THE GAPING HOLE AGAIN. COULD IT BE?
WILL HE STRIKE TWICE? HE DOES.
78 MORE YARDS FOR LEONARD FOURNETTE.
HOLD ON TO YOUR HEISMAN TROPHY! 59, 76 AND NOW 78.
&gt;&gt; Jesse: HE HAS CARRIED IT SEVEN TIME, AND NEARING 250
YARDS AND TRUE FRESHMAN SAFETY DEONTAY ANDERSON IS HAVING A
HARD NIGHT WITH LEONARD FOURNETTE.
AND LOOK AT HIM, HE GOT RUN OVER RL RLY BEFORE FOURNETTE CAUGHT
THE BALL, AND THIS TIME, HE TAKES THE STIFF ARM.
HE FINDS OUT ABOUT THE POWER THAT LEONARD FOURNETTE HAS, AND
THE STIFF ARM IS BECOMING LEGENDARY THIS YEAR.
IT IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MORE VIOLENT ONES I HAVE EVER SEEN.
&gt;&gt; Brent: DELAHOUSSAYE. HE TACKS IT UP.
28-21. WORTH ANOTHER LOOK.
ENJOY. DOWN GOES THE DB.
 CATCH ME IF YOU CAN. BIG BOY FOOTBALL.                  I'm here in Br.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; THIS IS IS THE S.E.C. ON ESPN, AND WHAT A SEASON WE ARE
HAVING. KENTUCKY JUST HAD A 51-YARD
FIELD GOAL BY AUSTIN McGINNES AS TIME EXPIRED, AND THEY RALLY
THIS THE CLOSING SECONDS TO EDGE MISSISSIPPI STATE.
HERE IT HAS BEEN THE TLOIGS SHOW.
MEANWHILE IN HAPPY VALLEY, PENN STATE PUTTING UP A STAND, AND
TRAILS OHIO STATE 21-17, AND HERE IS DAVIS.
25, AND BRINGS IT TO THE 30 YARD LINE.
AND GOOD STARTING FIELD POSITION.
&gt;&gt; Jesse: YES, THAT IS WHAT THEY WILL NEED.
AND WITH THE DEFENSE'S INABILITY TO STOP LEONARD FOURNETTE RIGHT
NOW RUNNING THE FOOTBALL, IT IS GOING TO PUT SO MUCH MORE
PRESSURE ON CHAD KELLY AND THE OFFENSE TO MAKE EACH AND EVERY
POSSESSION COUNT. THIS GAME IS TURNING INTO THE
OFFENSIVE SHOOTOUT ON BOTH SIDES.
OLE MISS, AND THEY MAKE THE LIVING THROWING IT, AND WE KNOW
THAT LEONARD FOURNETTE MAKES A LIVING RUNNING IT.
AND WHICH SIDE CAN MAKE THE MOST PLAYS?
&gt;&gt; Brent: GREGITTLE WHO WE MENTIONED IS THE TACKLE ON THE
LEFT SIDE, AND TREMENDOUS UPSIDE, BUT HE IS A TRUE
FRESHMAN, AND WEIGHING IN AT LEFT TACKLE.
HE IS UP AGAINST KEY, AND KEY CAME AROUND THE EDGE ON THE
PRESSURE, AND WELCOME TO THE SPEED RUSHER IN THE S.E.C.,
YOUNG MAN. &gt;&gt; Jesse: IT IS A BAD IDEA TO
BLOCK ARDEN KEY WITH ONE GUY. AND OLE MISS NOW OFFENSIVELY,
SCHEMATICALLY IS GOING TO HAVE TO CHAK THAT.
&gt;&gt; Brent: HE IS TRYING TO GET THERE AGAIN, AND HE COULD NOT.
AND ENGRAM WITH THE FIRST CATCH AND DRILLED BY WHITE.
&gt;&gt; Jesse: THIS IS THE SCENARIO TO GIVE THE TRUE FRESHMAN GREG
LITTLE HELP. ARDEN KEY CAN MOVE AROUND, BUT
THEY KEEP HIM LINED UP ON THE LEFT SIDE WITH CHAD KELLY AND
THE BLINDSIDE. AND OLE MISS DOES NOT NEED HIM
TO BLOCK, BUT TO RUN THE ROUTE. HOW DO YOU HELP THE TRUE
FRESHMAN OUT? RIGHT NOW, THEY HAVE THE RUNNING
BACK LINED UP ON THAT SIDE AS WELL.
&gt;&gt; Brent: THERE IS KEY. GOT TO HIM AGAIN.
IT WAS KEY WHO FORCED THE ISSUE, AND THEN GODCHAUX CLEANED IT UP,
BUT HE SHOWED THE MAN RUSH, AND YOU HAVE TO GET THE
H-BACK OR A FULLBACK OR SOMEBODY OVER THERE TO HELP HIM AGAINST
THIS YOUNG MAN. &gt;&gt; Jesse: HE IS WAY TOO QUICK,
AND SHOWS THE STUNT, AND 6'6" AND 240 AND THE ABILITY TO BEND,
AND YOU ARE RIGHT, HE DID NOT MAKE THE SACK, BUT HE MADE THE
PLAY, AND GODCHAUX CLEANED IT UP, BUT ARDEN KEY IS THE NEXT
KEKE MINGO AND DONNEL HUNTER PASS RUSH E.
&gt;&gt; AND WHITE IS BACK. FROM THE 22 YARD LINE, AND
SPINNING TO THE 37 YARD LINE. THE LSU DEFENSE AGAINST THE
INJURY-RIDDLED OFFENSIVE LINE</description>

&gt;&gt; Brent: OUR OPS MANAGER IS RIDING THAT BIKE AND WE CALL HIM
KOOCH, AND PENN STATE HAS GONE AHEAD OF OHIO STATE, AND 4:27
LEFT AND THAT GAME IS ON ABC, 23-21, PENN STATE.
AND NOW, MOUTON IN FOR LSU, AND ETLING HAS THE OPEN MAN AND THAT
IS MALACHI DUPRE. &gt;&gt; Jesse: I REALLY LIKE TO WATCH
DANNY ETLING SINCE HE TOOK OVER, AND HE HAS JUST BROUGHT THIS
OFFENSE AN ADDED ELEMENT. HERE THEY ARE WORKING THE
TWO-MAN ROUTE, AND WITH USED TO CA IT THE FORK ROUTE IN
FLORIDA, AND MALACHI DUPRE IN THE SLOT, AND WORKING TO THE
BOUNDARY WITH A VERY CATCHABLE BALL THROWN BY DANNY ETLING.
&gt;&gt; Brent: FIRST DOWN AND TEN FROM THE OLE MISS 45 YARD LINE.
LSU IS UP BY SEVEN. TOSS PLAY.
FOURNETTE STOPPED. UNUSUAL WORD TO SAY WITH

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE BMW ALL-PERFORMANCE NOMINEE, AND
UTAH'S JOE WILLIAMS. 332 RUSHING YARDS, AND A SCHOOL
RECORD, AND ALSO FOUR TOUCHDOWNS.
THIS IS A GUY WHO RETIRED AND CAME BACK.
&gt;&gt; GOOD FOR HIM. &gt;&gt; AND THE BMW ALL PERFORMANCE
TODAY. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.
TOP TEN BLITZ. THE BEST SCHOOLS RIGHT NOW IN
THE COUNTRY, AND PLAYS FEATURING THEM.
SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT HERE, AND HOW ABOUT WISCONSIN
AND IOWA AND A TOUCHDOWN HERE FOR WISCONSIN TO LEAD.
&gt;&gt; AND THIS WISCONSIN TEAM WITH THE CHANCE TO WIN THE BIG TEN
WEST AND CHASING NEBRASKA, AND THEY HAVE TO HOPE THAT NEBRASKA
LOSES ANOTHER GAME ALONG THE WAY.
&gt;&gt; AND COREY CLEMON THERE ON THE  THE BALL.
&gt;&gt; AND LAMAR JACKSON HOSTING LOUISVILLE AND N.C. STATE.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS A LAMAR JACKSON SHOW, AND EVERY TIME YOU SEE
LOUISVILLE PLAY, HE IS THE FRONT-RUNNER THE HEISMAN AND HE
IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO PUT UP THE HUGE NUMBERS.
&gt;&gt; AND HE IS NOT THE FRONT RUN E  THAT IS WHAT HE IS.
&gt;&gt; AND 54-13 AS JACKSON PADS THE STATS EVEN MORE.
&gt;&gt; AND HOW ABOUT MICHIGAN? &gt;&gt; WELL, A FAKE HERE FOR
MICHIGAN TO WIN AT THE INTERMISSION.
&gt;&gt; THE FIRST HALF, THEY THOUGHT EASY, BUT THE SECOND HALF, HERE COMES THE TEST.
AND MICHIGAN STATE HAS NOT BASKETBALL LOOKING GOOD, BUT
THEY ARE LOOKING AT OHIO STATE AT THE END OF THE SEASON.
&gt;&gt; AND MICHIGAN IS GOING TO WITH WIN THIS ONE, AND ALSO, NUMBER
EIGHT, NEBRASKA HOSTING PURDUE. THIS IS TOMMY AM STRONG JUNIOR,
AND THE BACKUP HERE. &gt;&gt; AND TOMMY ARMSTRONG WITH THIS
OFFENSE, AND THIS IS THE NEBRASKA TEAM THAT I STILL DON'T
KNOW HOW GOOD THEY ARE, BECAUSE OF THE QUALITY OF THE WIN, AND
ANOTHER ONE AGAINST PURDUE. &gt;&gt; AND NOW, CHRIS PETERSEN
HOSTING OREGON STATE, AND NOW, DONTE PETTIS HERE, AS THEY GO ON
IN. AND WASHINGTON LEADING IT.
&gt;&gt; THE SURPRISE OF THE COLLEGE FOOTBALL SEASON IS WASHINGTON
SEPARATING ITSELF AS THE PAC-12 LEADER.
&gt;&gt; MORE UPDATES AFTER THIS.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt; HOWARD AND WEST VIRGINIA
HOSTING TCU AND THE MOUNTAINEERS ARE LEADING.
A GREAT CATCH THIS THE END ZONE. &gt;&gt; THERE IS FOUR OR FIVE PLAYS,
OR FOUR OR FIVE CATCHES THAT YOU COULD SEE FROM THE ROOKIE WIDE
RECEIVERS MAKING PLAYS ALL DAY LONG.
&gt;&gt; AND NOW, MOVING UP IN THE OVERALL RANKINGS.
PENN STATE AND OHIO STATE, AND THIS IS McSORLEY OVER TO THE
SAYED BLACKWELL, AND NOW, THROWING IT UP TO GIVE THE
RECEIVER A CHANCE TO MAKE THE PLAY, AND PENN STATE IS MAKING
THEM RIGHT NOW, HANGING TOUGH IN THE GAME.

      <description>LEONARD FOURNETTE.
HE MISSED THE LAST FEW GAMES WITH A LEFT ANKLE INJURY, AND HE
MADE THE PRESENCE FELT EARLY, AND LOOKING EXPLOSIVE AND HE MAY
NOT BE 100%, BUT SHOWING TREMENDOUS SPEED AND POWER, AND
SIX CARRIES FOR 171 YARDS ALREADY FOR THE LSU RUNNING
BACKMENT THAF HAVE BEEN CREATIVE IN HOW THEY HAVE BEEN USING HIM
OUT OF THE BACKFIELD, AND A GREAT SERIES OF PLAYS FOR OLE
MISS LATE IN THE FIRST HALF. MARQUESS HAYNES AND HE GETS THE
SACK ON DANNY ETLING, AND THEY TAKE OVER DEEP IN LSU TERRITORY,
AND RUN A ZONE READ PLAY TO AKEEM JUDD, AND THEY WENT FOR IT
ON THE TWO-POINT CONVERSION, A BSZ CHAD KELLY RUNNING IT IN ON
THE ZONE READ, AND HERE WE ARE, BRENT, DEADLOCKED.
&gt;&gt; Brent: AND JUST AS CHAD KELLY IS BRINGING THE OFFENSE OUT,
THEIR FIRST POSSESSION HERE OF THE SECOND HALF, AND AFTER THE
TOUCHBACK, OF COURSE, THEY WILL START FROM THE 25.
WHAT OTHER THINGS DID YOU LIKE ABOUT IT?
&gt;&gt; Jesse: WELL, I LIKE THE FACT THAT HE SLINGS IT.
HE IS A COMPETITOR AND NOT GOING TO STOP TAKING THE SHOTS.
THIS OFFENSE IN THE EXPLOSIVE NATURE IS BUILT ON THE ABILITY
TO THROW THE VERTICAL BALL DOWN THE FIELD, AND THEY WON SOME OF
THE ONE-ON-ONE MATCHUPS AND LOST SOME, BUT IT IS NOT GOING TO BE
SCARING NUMBER 10 FROM SLINGING IT DOWN THE FIELD HERE IN THE
SECOND HALF. &gt;&gt; Brent: HE OPENS ONE JUDD AS
THE RUNNING BACK. FIRST CALL INTO THE MIDDLE TO
THE 30 YARD LINE. AND NEAL IS GOING TO BRING HIM
DOWN FOR LSU. SECOND DOWN AND FIVE.
BATTERING IT STRAIGHT AHEAD, JUST A YARD SHORT, AND NEAL
AGAIN. &gt;&gt; Jesse: THIS IS ONE THING TO
HELP CHAD KELLY IN THE VERTICAL PASSING END IF THEY CAN
ESTABLISH SOME OF THE RUN PLAYS, AND INSIDE ZONES, AND THAT IS
GOING TO ALLOW HIM TO CRASH IT DOWN THE FIELD.
THAT IS WHAT HE IS USED TO IN THIS OFFENSE.
&gt;&gt; Brent: JUDD, AND HE WAS STOPPED SHORT OF THE FIRST DOWN,
AND RILEY HIT HIM FIRST. &gt;&gt; Jesse: YES, DUKE RILEY FIRED
THROUGH THE GAP, AS THERE IS AN OLE MISS PLAYER DOWN ON THE
GROUND. IT LOOKS LIKE THE STARTING LEFT
TACKLE ROD TAYLOR GRABBING THE ANKLE.
THAT IS A CRITICAL POSITION IN THE GAME FOR OLE MISS, TOO,
BECAUSE HE IS THE GUY TO PROTECT CHAD KELLY'S BLINDSIDE FACING
ARDEN KEY WHO IS LEADING THE S.E.C. IN SACKS RIGHT NOW WITH
SEVEN. OLE MISS WITH THE EXCELLENT
BACKUP IN GREG LITTLE A TRUE FRESHMAN AND NUMBER WO OVERALL
PROSPECT IN HIGH SCHOOL, AND HE HAS GOTTEN A LOT OF SNAPS, AND
YOU CAN SEE THE FRIENDLY FIRE COMING IN BEHIND HIM, AND BLOCK
ING HIM AT THE ANKLE, AND RIGHT AWAY, HE GOES DOWN.
YOU CAN SEE THE LSU PLAYERS AND HOW MUCH THEY THE RESPECT ROD
TAYLOR, AND HUDDLING NEAR HIM. THAT IS A GREAT RIVALRY GAME,
OBVIOUSLY, BUT THESE PLAYERS A LOT OF THEM KNOW EACH OTHER
THIS, AND THEY PLAYED AGAINST EACH OTHER IN HIGH SCHOOL, AND
CERTAINLY, S.E.C. WEST OPPONENT, AND GOOD TO SEE HIM RIGHT THERE
GETTING UP. &gt;&gt; Brent: THAT IS GOING TO
PROBABLY SIGNAL THE ARRIVAL OF A FRESHMAN BY THE NAME OF GREG
LITTLE WHEN THEY COME BACK, AND RIGHT NOW, IT IS OF COURSE,
GOING TO BE THE PUNTING TEAM ON THE FIELD WITH FOURTH AND ONE
STOPPED ON THE FIRST SERIES. &gt;&gt; Brent: WHITE AGAIN GOING BACK
DEEP TO RETURN THIS PUNT. STANDING ON THE LSU 23.
GLEESON WITH THE LEFT FOOT, AND FAIR CATCH SIGNAL AT THE 22 YARD
LINE, AND THE CATCH IS MADE, AND AS KENTUCKY HAS BEATEN
MISSISSIPPI STATE AT THE BUS WER A FIELD GOAL, WE CHECK IN BELOW
WITH KAYLEE AND COACH O. &gt;&gt; Kaylee: BRETT, IF WE CUT DOWN
ON THE TURNOVERS AND KEEP GIVING IT TO LEONARD FOURNETTE, IT IS
GOING TO BE A VICTORY. BUT HE SAYS THAT THE TURNOVERS
ARE STOPPING THEM. WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING AT WHAT THE
DEFENSIVE BACKS HAVE DONE AS WELL, AND WE HAVE SEEN THE GOOD
AND THE BAD FROM THEM, AND HE SAYS A COUPLE OF BLOWN COVERAGES
AND A COUPLE OF CALLS THAT WERE  ABOUT THE ASSIGNMENTS HERE.
&gt;&gt; Brent: THE DANNY ETLING, AND THAT IS MOUTON STANDING IN FRONT
OF NUMBER 7, LEONARD FOURNETTE. RIGHT SIDE.
THERE'S THE GAPING HOLE AGAIN. COULD IT BE?
WILL HE STRIKE TWICE? HE DOES.
78 MORE YARDS FOR LEONARD FOURNETTE.
HOLD ON TO YOUR HEISMAN TROPHY! 59, 76 AND NOW 78.
&gt;&gt; Jesse: HE HAS CARRIED IT SEVEN TIME, AND NEARING 250
YARDS AND TRUE FRESHMAN SAFETY DEONTAY ANDERSON IS HAVING A
HARD NIGHT WITH LEONARD FOURNETTE.
AND LOOK AT HIM, HE GOT RUN OVER RL RLY BEFORE FOURNETTE CAUGHT
THE BALL, AND THIS TIME, HE TAKES THE STIFF ARM.
HE FINDS OUT ABOUT THE POWER THAT LEONARD FOURNETTE HAS, AND
THE STIFF ARM IS BECOMING LEGENDARY THIS YEAR.
IT IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MORE VIOLENT ONES I HAVE EVER SEEN.
&gt;&gt; Brent: DELAHOUSSAYE. HE TACKS IT UP.
28-21. WORTH ANOTHER LOOK.
ENJOY. DOWN GOES THE DB.
 CATCH ME IF YOU CAN. BIG BOY FOOTBALL.                  I'm here in Br.</description>

      <description>&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; THIS IS IS THE S.E.C. ON ESPN, AND WHAT A SEASON WE ARE
HAVING. KENTUCKY JUST HAD A 51-YARD
FIELD GOAL BY AUSTIN McGINNES AS TIME EXPIRED, AND THEY RALLY
THIS THE CLOSING SECONDS TO EDGE MISSISSIPPI STATE.
HERE IT HAS BEEN THE TLOIGS SHOW.
MEANWHILE IN HAPPY VALLEY, PENN STATE PUTTING UP A STAND, AND
TRAILS OHIO STATE 21-17, AND HERE IS DAVIS.
25, AND BRINGS IT TO THE 30 YARD LINE.
AND GOOD STARTING FIELD POSITION.
&gt;&gt; Jesse: YES, THAT IS WHAT THEY WILL NEED.
AND WITH THE DEFENSE'S INABILITY TO STOP LEONARD FOURNETTE RIGHT
NOW RUNNING THE FOOTBALL, IT IS GOING TO PUT SO MUCH MORE
PRESSURE ON CHAD KELLY AND THE OFFENSE TO MAKE EACH AND EVERY
POSSESSION COUNT. THIS GAME IS TURNING INTO THE
OFFENSIVE SHOOTOUT ON BOTH SIDES.
OLE MISS, AND THEY MAKE THE LIVING THROWING IT, AND WE KNOW
THAT LEONARD FOURNETTE MAKES A LIVING RUNNING IT.
AND WHICH SIDE CAN MAKE THE MOST PLAYS?
&gt;&gt; Brent: GREGITTLE WHO WE MENTIONED IS THE TACKLE ON THE
LEFT SIDE, AND TREMENDOUS UPSIDE, BUT HE IS A TRUE
FRESHMAN, AND WEIGHING IN AT LEFT TACKLE.
HE IS UP AGAINST KEY, AND KEY CAME AROUND THE EDGE ON THE
PRESSURE, AND WELCOME TO THE SPEED RUSHER IN THE S.E.C.,
YOUNG MAN. &gt;&gt; Jesse: IT IS A BAD IDEA TO
BLOCK ARDEN KEY WITH ONE GUY. AND OLE MISS NOW OFFENSIVELY,
SCHEMATICALLY IS GOING TO HAVE TO CHAK THAT.
&gt;&gt; Brent: HE IS TRYING TO GET THERE AGAIN, AND HE COULD NOT.
AND ENGRAM WITH THE FIRST CATCH AND DRILLED BY WHITE.
&gt;&gt; Jesse: THIS IS THE SCENARIO TO GIVE THE TRUE FRESHMAN GREG
LITTLE HELP. ARDEN KEY CAN MOVE AROUND, BUT
THEY KEEP HIM LINED UP ON THE LEFT SIDE WITH CHAD KELLY AND
THE BLINDSIDE. AND OLE MISS DOES NOT NEED HIM
TO BLOCK, BUT TO RUN THE ROUTE. HOW DO YOU HELP THE TRUE
FRESHMAN OUT? RIGHT NOW, THEY HAVE THE RUNNING
BACK LINED UP ON THAT SIDE AS WELL.
&gt;&gt; Brent: THERE IS KEY. GOT TO HIM AGAIN.
IT WAS KEY WHO FORCED THE ISSUE, AND THEN GODCHAUX CLEANED IT UP,
BUT HE SHOWED THE MAN RUSH, AND YOU HAVE TO GET THE
H-BACK OR A FULLBACK OR SOMEBODY OVER THERE TO HELP HIM AGAINST
THIS YOUNG MAN. &gt;&gt; Jesse: HE IS WAY TOO QUICK,
AND SHOWS THE STUNT, AND 6'6" AND 240 AND THE ABILITY TO BEND,
AND YOU ARE RIGHT, HE DID NOT MAKE THE SACK, BUT HE MADE THE
PLAY, AND GODCHAUX CLEANED IT UP, BUT ARDEN KEY IS THE NEXT
KEKE MINGO AND DONNEL HUNTER PASS RUSH E.
&gt;&gt; AND WHITE IS BACK. FROM THE 22 YARD LINE, AND
SPINNING TO THE 37 YARD LINE. THE LSU DEFENSE AGAINST THE
INJURY-RIDDLED OFFENSIVE LINE</description>

&gt;&gt; Brent: OUR OPS MANAGER IS RIDING THAT BIKE AND WE CALL HIM
KOOCH, AND PENN STATE HAS GONE AHEAD OF OHIO STATE, AND 4:27
LEFT AND THAT GAME IS ON ABC, 23-21, PENN STATE.
AND NOW, MOUTON IN FOR LSU, AND ETLING HAS THE OPEN MAN AND THAT
IS MALACHI DUPRE. &gt;&gt; Jesse: I REALLY LIKE TO WATCH
DANNY ETLING SINCE HE TOOK OVER, AND HE HAS JUST BROUGHT THIS
OFFENSE AN ADDED ELEMENT. HERE THEY ARE WORKING THE
TWO-MAN ROUTE, AND WITH USED TO CA IT THE FORK ROUTE IN
FLORIDA, AND MALACHI DUPRE IN THE SLOT, AND WORKING TO THE
BOUNDARY WITH A VERY CATCHABLE BALL THROWN BY DANNY ETLING.
&gt;&gt; Brent: FIRST DOWN AND TEN FROM THE OLE MISS 45 YARD LINE.
LSU IS UP BY SEVEN. TOSS PLAY.
FOURNETTE STOPPED. UNUSUAL WORD TO SAY WITH
FOURNETTE AS WE ARE CHECKING IN</description>
